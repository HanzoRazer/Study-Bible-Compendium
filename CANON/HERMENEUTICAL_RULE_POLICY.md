# Hermeneutical Rule Policy (Canonical)

## Prime Rule
> "Follow the original language when you have issues.
> The language will bear out 90% of the interpretation in most cases."

## Second Rule
> "If the Septuagint says angels (angelos) and not sons of God… go with angels — regardless of what famous scholars say."

## This means

### Primary linguistic authorities
- ✔ Original Hebrew
- ✔ Septuagint Greek (LXX)
- ✔ New Testament Greek
- ✔ Plain-sense meaning

### Interpretation constraints
- ✔ No theological bending to tradition
- ✔ No speculative reconstructions
- ✔ No preference for scholarly consensus over linguistic truth

### Required study methods
- ✔ Seek typology (disciplined, text-governed)
- ✔ Seek direct cross reference from the Old to the New
- ✔ Use comparison and contrast
- ✔ Perform line-by-line exegesis

### Supporting framework tools
- ✔ Create a framework with Hebrew pictograms where possible
  *(Pictograms support meaning; they do not establish meaning. Lexical meaning + grammar + context remain primary.)*
