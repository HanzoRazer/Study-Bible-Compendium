📘 HERMENEUTICAL RULE POLICY
Study Bible Compendium – Governing Interpretive Standard

1. THE PRIME RULE OF INTERPRETATION

"Follow the original language when you have issues.
The language will bear out 90% of the interpretation in most cases."

When a passage is unclear, debated, or misinterpreted, the authority is:

• Hebrew (Old Testament)
• Septuagint Greek (LXX)
• New Testament Greek

This policy rejects:
• tradition as final authority
• commentary as final authority
• denominational doctrine as final authority
• consensus interpretation as final authority
• theological systems overriding the text

The inspired text rules.
Everything else is secondary.


2. RULE OF TEXTUAL HONESTY

"If the Septuagint says angels (angelos) and not sons of God… go with angels —
regardless of what famous scholars say."

This rule guards against:
• traditional override of the text
• theological pressure applied to words
• academic bias shaping meaning
• forced doctrinal models imposed on passages

Summary:
• Text over tradition
• Language over scholars
• Original meaning over reconstruction


3. LINGUISTIC PRIORITY ORDER

Interpretation must follow this hierarchy:

1) Original Hebrew
   Use root forms, stems, idioms, parallel usages, and context.

2) Septuagint Greek (LXX)
   Often preserves older Hebrew traditions, clarifies idioms, reveals ancient
   Jewish understanding, and aligns with New Testament apostolic usage.

3) New Testament Greek
   Apostolic citation and interpretation of the Old Testament is final.

4) Plain-Sense Meaning
   Interpret the text in its natural, plain sense, unless the context clearly
   demands metaphor, parable, typology, or symbolic usage.


4. WHAT THIS POLICY REJECTS

❌ Bending Scripture to fit denominational tradition
❌ Speculative reconstructions not grounded in language or context
❌ Mystical reinterpretations detached from the text
❌ Theological systems overriding clear wording
❌ Forcing doctrines into words that do not carry them
❌ Consensus-driven meanings that contradict linguistic facts
❌ Proof-texting without context

The text governs theology.
Theology does not govern the text.


5. REQUIRED METHODS OF EXEGESIS

A. Seek Typology

   Interpret typology where the structure, pattern, or usage is explicit or implied
   within Scripture itself:

   • shadow → substance
   • type → antitype
   • Old Testament prophecy → New Testament fulfillment
   • narrative parallels that the Bible itself recognizes or echoes

   Typology is treated as God's architectural signature, not human imagination.


B. Seek Direct OT ↔ NT Cross-References

   Scripture must interpret Scripture.

   • If Jesus cites it → His interpretation is final.
   • If Paul cites it → that apostolic explanation is authoritative.
   • If Hebrews expounds it → that interpretation is authoritative.
   • If the Gospels or Epistles apply an Old Testament text typologically →
     that application is binding for how we understand the passage.

   Required question: "Where is this used or echoed in the New Testament?"


C. Comparison and Contrast

   Biblical truth is clarified by comparison and contrast:

   • covenants (old vs. new)
   • Adam vs. Christ
   • Joseph vs. Christ
   • law vs. grace
   • flesh vs. spirit
   • shadow vs. reality
   • earthly pattern vs. heavenly reality

   This is a core Hebrew teaching method and is central to this policy.


D. Line-by-Line Exegesis

   Interpretation is performed:
   • word by word
   • phrase by phrase
   • clause by clause
   • in continuous context

   Never:
   • skip context to reach a desired doctrinal conclusion
   • impose a system onto a verse
   • build doctrine from isolated fragments
   • ignore grammar, syntax, or discourse flow

   A verse means what it means in its textual location, in its book,
   and within the whole canon.


6. OPTIONAL TOOL: HEBREW PICTOGRAM FRAMEWORK

Hebrew pictographs may be used to support:

• lexical meaning
• conceptual depth
• natural imagery behind roots
• teaching clarity
• typological connections

But:

• Pictographs support meaning; they never override lexical definition.
• Pictographs are a secondary teaching aid, not the primary determinant
  of doctrine.

Order of priority:
• Lexical meaning first.
• Pictograph and visual associations second.


7. SUMMARY STATEMENT

This Hermeneutical Rule Policy establishes:

• Text over tradition
• Language over commentary
• Old–New Testament unity over denominational division
• Typology over speculation
• Exegesis over imagination
• Context over proof-texting
• Hebrew thought-forms over abstract philosophical systems
• Spirit-led insight anchored in linguistic and textual truth

As a result, this policy ensures that:

• Scripture interprets itself.
• Theology flows from the inspired text.
• Christ is revealed in both Testaments without distortion.
• Believers are protected from false doctrine birthed from poor exegesis.
• Teaching remains mature, accurate, and Spirit-filled.

This policy is binding for all commentary, notes, word studies, cross-references,
and doctrinal conclusions within the Study Bible Compendium.
