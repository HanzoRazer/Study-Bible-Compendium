Study Bible Compendium – Hermeneutical Foundation

This Study Bible Compendium is built on the conviction that Holy Scripture is the inspired,
sufficient, and authoritative Word of God, breathed out by the Spirit and preserved for the
people of God in history. Because Scripture is God's Word, it interprets itself, governs all
doctrine, and stands above every tradition, denomination, commentary, and human teacher.

We affirm the unity of the Old and New Testaments and confess that the entire canon,
from Genesis to Revelation, bears faithful witness to the person and work of the Messiah.
The Law, the Prophets, the Writings, the Gospels, and the Apostolic writings form a single,
coherent revelation in which Christ is the central figure and interpretive key—without
cancelling the plain sense, historical setting, or linguistic reality of any passage.

For this reason, our method refuses to bend the text to fit systems, trends, or personalities.
Instead, it submits every interpretation to the original languages—Hebrew, the Septuagint
Greek (LXX), and New Testament Greek—together with careful attention to context, grammar,
typology, and inspired cross-references. Where hard choices must be made, the language of
the text rules over tradition, opinion, or consensus.

This Hermeneutical Rule Policy is therefore not an optional appendix, but the binding
interpretive standard for all commentary, notes, word studies, and doctrinal conclusions
within this Compendium. Every study, cross-reference, and theological conclusion is
expected to conform to these rules, so that God's Word may be handled with reverence,
accuracy, and integrity, and so that Christ may be seen clearly in the very words by
which the Spirit chose to reveal Him.
