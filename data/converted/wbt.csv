Joshua,8,25,"And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all"

Ruth,2,22,"And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou shouldst go out with"
Ruth,2,23,So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean to the end of barley-harvest and of wheat-harvest; and dwelt with her mother-in-law.

Ruth,3,14,"And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose before one could know another. And he said,"
Ruth,3,15,"Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and"

Ruth,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception,"
Ruth,4,14,"And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, who hath not left thee this"
Ruth,4,15,"And he shall be to thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thy old age: for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him."
Ruth,4,16,"And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became its nurse."
Ruth,4,17,"And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. The Line of David (Matthew 1:1–17; Luke 3:23–38)"

1 Samuel,1,3,And this man went up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh.
1 Samuel,1,4,"And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters,"

1 Samuel,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli observed her mouth."
1 Samuel,1,13,"Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought"

1 Samuel,2,1,"And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD; my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation."
1 Samuel,2,2,There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none besides thee: neither is there any rock like our God.
1 Samuel,2,3,"Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed."
1 Samuel,2,4,"The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength."
1 Samuel,2,5,They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath borne seven; and she that hath many children is become feeble.
1 Samuel,2,6,"The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up."

1 Samuel,2,8,"He raiseth the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD’S, and he hath set the world upon them."

1 Samuel,2,10,"The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed."
1 Samuel,2,11,And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest. Eli’s Wicked Sons
1 Samuel,2,12,Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.

1 Samuel,2,17,Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
1 Samuel,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod."
1 Samuel,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her"
1 Samuel,2,20,"And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee issue of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went to their own home."
1 Samuel,2,21,"And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD."
1 Samuel,2,22,"Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women"

1 Samuel,3,1,And the child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.

1 Samuel,3,9,"Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he should call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
1 Samuel,3,10,"And the LORD came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel"

1 Samuel,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years."

1 Samuel,5,11,"So they sent and convened all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for"
1 Samuel,5,12,"And the men that died not, were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven."
1 Samuel,6,1,And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.

1 Samuel,7,15,And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1 Samuel,7,16,And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-

1 Samuel,8,8,According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them out of Egypt even
1 Samuel,8,9,"Now therefore hearken to their voice: yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that will reign over them. Samuel’s Warning"
1 Samuel,8,10,And Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people that asked of him a king.
1 Samuel,8,11,"And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them"
1 Samuel,8,12,"And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to till his ground,"

1 Samuel,13,1,"Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,"

1 Samuel,13,10,"And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold,"
1 Samuel,13,11,"And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest"

1 Samuel,13,20,"But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen"
1 Samuel,13,21,"Yet they had a file for the mattocks,"
1 Samuel,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people"
1 Samuel,13,23,And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
1 Samuel,14,1,"Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines, that is on the other side. But he told"

1 Samuel,14,10,"But if they say thus, Come up to us; then"
1 Samuel,14,11,"And both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold,"
1 Samuel,14,12,"And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand"
1 Samuel,14,13,"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor-bearer after"
1 Samuel,14,14,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were a half-acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow."
1 Samuel,14,15,"And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling."
1 Samuel,14,16,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away,"
1 Samuel,14,17,"Then said Saul to the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his"

1 Samuel,14,30,"How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?"
1 Samuel,14,31,And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ajalon: and the people were very faint.
1 Samuel,14,32,"And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the"
1 Samuel,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone"
1 Samuel,14,34,"And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night,"
1 Samuel,14,35,And Saul built an altar to the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built to the LORD:
1 Samuel,14,36,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seemeth good to thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither to God. The People Save Jonathan"
1 Samuel,14,37,"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the"

1 Samuel,14,41,"Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the"
1 Samuel,14,42,"And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken."
1 Samuel,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but"
1 Samuel,14,44,And Saul
1 Samuel,14,45,"And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? By no means: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day."
1 Samuel,14,46,Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place. Saul’s Victories
1 Samuel,14,47,"So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against"
1 Samuel,14,48,"And he gathered a host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of them that spoiled them."
1 Samuel,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters"
1 Samuel,14,50,"And the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was"
1 Samuel,14,51,And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
1 Samuel,14,52,"And there was violent war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him to himself."
1 Samuel,15,1,"Samuel also said to Saul, the LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel:"
1 Samuel,15,2,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from"
1 Samuel,15,3,"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass."
1 Samuel,15,4,"And Saul assembled the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and"
1 Samuel,15,5,"And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley."
1 Samuel,15,6,"And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, withdraw yourselves from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up from Egypt. So the"
1 Samuel,15,7,"And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah, until thou"
1 Samuel,15,8,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and"
1 Samuel,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly. Samuel Denounces Saul"
1 Samuel,15,10,"Then came the word of the LORD to Samuel, saying,"
1 Samuel,15,11,"I repent that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved"
1 Samuel,15,12,"And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set him up a place, and has gone"
1 Samuel,15,13,"And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him,"
1 Samuel,15,14,"And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"
1 Samuel,15,15,"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed."
1 Samuel,15,16,"Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on."
1 Samuel,15,17,"And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thy own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes"
1 Samuel,15,18,"And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are"
1 Samuel,15,19,"Why then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?"
1 Samuel,15,20,"And Saul said to Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the"
1 Samuel,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,22,"And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."
1 Samuel,15,23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king. Saul’s Confession"
1 Samuel,15,24,"And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD,"
1 Samuel,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee,"
1 Samuel,15,26,"And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected"
1 Samuel,15,27,"And as Samuel turned about to depart, he laid hold upon the skirt"
1 Samuel,15,28,"And Samuel said to him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from"
1 Samuel,15,29,And also the Strength
1 Samuel,15,30,"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn"
1 Samuel,15,31,So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped the LORD.
1 Samuel,15,32,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him"
1 Samuel,15,33,"And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,34,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel,15,35,And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
1 Samuel,16,1,"And the LORD said to Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for I"
1 Samuel,16,2,"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul shall hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I have come to sacrifice to the LORD."
1 Samuel,16,3,"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint to me"
1 Samuel,16,4,"And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Beth-lehem. And"
1 Samuel,16,5,"And he said, Peaceably: I have come to sacrifice to the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice."
1 Samuel,16,6,"And it came to pass when they had come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD’S"
1 Samuel,16,7,"But the LORD said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the hight of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on"
1 Samuel,16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made"
1 Samuel,16,9,Then Jesse made Shammah
1 Samuel,16,10,"Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to"
1 Samuel,16,11,"And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and bring him: for we will not sit down till he hath come hither."
1 Samuel,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and also of a beautiful countenance, and a"
1 Samuel,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose, and went to Ramah. David Serves Saul"
1 Samuel,16,14,"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him."
1 Samuel,16,15,And
1 Samuel,16,16,"Let our lord now command thy servants, who are before thee, to seek a man who is a skillful player on a harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he will play with his hand, and thou"
1 Samuel,16,17,"And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him"
1 Samuel,16,18,"Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth- lehemite, that is skillful in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters,"
1 Samuel,16,19,"Wherefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said,"
1 Samuel,16,20,"And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a"
1 Samuel,16,21,"And David came to Saul, and stood"
1 Samuel,16,22,"And Saul sent to Jesse,"
1 Samuel,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took a harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."
1 Samuel,17,1,"Now the Philistines collected their armies to battle, and were assembled at Shochoh, which belongeth"
1 Samuel,17,2,"And Saul and the men of Israel were assembled and encamped by the valley of Elah, and they set the battle in array against the"
1 Samuel,17,3,"And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain"
1 Samuel,17,4,And there went out a champion from the

1 Samuel,17,6,"And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass"
1 Samuel,17,7,And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head
1 Samuel,17,8,"And he stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why have ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me."
1 Samuel,17,9,"If he shall be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I shall prevail"
1 Samuel,17,10,"And the Philistine said, I defy"
1 Samuel,17,11,"When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. David Accepts the Challenge"
1 Samuel,17,12,"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had"
1 Samuel,17,13,And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the

1 Samuel,17,20,"And David rose early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted"
1 Samuel,17,21,"For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army."
1 Samuel,17,22,"And David left his furniture in the hand of the keeper of the vessels, and ran into the army, and came and"
1 Samuel,17,23,"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, from the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them."
1 Samuel,17,24,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were exceedingly afraid."
1 Samuel,17,25,"And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that hath come up? surely to defy Israel hath he come: and it shall be, that the man who shall kill him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel."
1 Samuel,17,26,"And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that"
1 Samuel,17,27,"And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him."
1 Samuel,17,28,"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou"
1 Samuel,17,29,"And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?"
1 Samuel,17,30,"And he turned from him towards another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner."
1 Samuel,17,31,"And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent"
1 Samuel,17,32,"And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight"
1 Samuel,17,33,"And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with"
1 Samuel,17,34,"And David said to Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:"

1 Samuel,17,38,"And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed"
1 Samuel,17,39,"And David girded his sword upon his armor, and he essayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said to Saul, I cannot go with these, for I have not proved them. And"
1 Samuel,17,40,"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine."
1 Samuel,17,41,And the Philistine advanced and drew near to David; and the man that bore the shield went before
1 Samuel,17,42,"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was a youth,"
1 Samuel,17,43,"And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that thou comest"

2 Samuel,18,21,"Then said Joab to Cushi, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself to Joab,"
2 Samuel,18,22,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But however, let me also, I pray thee, run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?"
2 Samuel,18,23,"But however, said he, let me run. And he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran Cushi."

1 Kings,2,38,"And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days."
1 Kings,2,39,"And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish"

1 Kings,3,4,And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high
1 Kings,3,5,"In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee."
1 Kings,3,6,"And Solomon said, Thou hast shown to thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day."

1 Kings,3,8,And thy servant is in the midst of thy people
1 Kings,3,9,"Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?"
1 Kings,3,10,"And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing."
1 Kings,3,11,"And God said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thy enemies: but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;"
1 Kings,3,12,"Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like to thee."
1 Kings,3,13,"And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honor: so that there"

1 Kings,3,15,"And Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. Solomon Judges Wisely"
1 Kings,3,16,"Then came there two women, that were harlots, to the king, and stood before him."
1 Kings,3,17,"And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her"
1 Kings,3,18,"And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save us two in the house."
1 Kings,3,19,And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
1 Kings,3,20,"And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead"
1 Kings,3,21,"And when I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead: but when"
1 Kings,3,22,"And the other woman said, No; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king."

1 Kings,3,27,Then the king answered and
1 Kings,3,28,"And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment."
1 Kings,4,1,So king Solomon was king over all Israel.

1 Kings,4,20,"Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry."
1 Kings,4,21,"And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life."
1 Kings,4,22,"And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal."
1 Kings,4,23,"Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and"

1 Kings,4,25,"And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-"
1 Kings,4,26,And Solomon had forty thousand stalls
1 Kings,4,27,"And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came to king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked"
1 Kings,4,28,"Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries they brought to the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. Solomon’s Wisdom"
1 Kings,4,29,"And God gave Solomon great wisdom and understanding, and largeness of heart, even as the sand"
1 Kings,4,30,And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east
1 Kings,4,31,"For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the surrounding nations."
1 Kings,4,32,And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
1 Kings,4,33,"And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he"
1 Kings,4,34,"And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom."
1 Kings,5,1,And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him
1 Kings,5,2,"And Solomon sent to Hiram,"
1 Kings,5,3,"Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house to the name of the LORD his God, for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his"
1 Kings,5,4,"But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary"

1 Kings,5,6,"Now therefore command thou, that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and to thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that is skilled in hewing timber like the Sidonians. Hiram’s Reply to Solomon (2 Chronicles 2:11–18)"
1 Kings,5,7,"And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said,"
1 Kings,5,8,"And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will perform"
1 Kings,5,9,"My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats to the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt"
1 Kings,5,10,So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir
1 Kings,5,11,"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year."
1 Kings,5,12,"And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together. Solomon’s Labor Force"
1 Kings,5,13,And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
1 Kings,5,14,"And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two"
1 Kings,5,15,And Solomon had seventy thousand that bore

1 Kings,5,17,"And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones,"
1 Kings,5,18,"And Solomon’s builders, and Hiram’s builders did hew them, and the stone-squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house."
1 Kings,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Zif, which is the"
1 Kings,6,2,"And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length of it was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits, and the hight"
1 Kings,6,3,"And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length of it,"
1 Kings,6,4,And for the house he made windows of narrow lights. The Chambers
1 Kings,6,5,"And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round"
1 Kings,6,6,"The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house."
1 Kings,6,7,"And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither; so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building."
1 Kings,6,8,The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding
1 Kings,6,9,So he built the house and finished
1 Kings,6,10,"And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. God’s Promise to Solomon"
1 Kings,6,11,"And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,"
1 Kings,6,12,"Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments"
1 Kings,6,13,"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel. The Temple’s Interior (2 Chronicles 3:5–9)"
1 Kings,6,14,"So Solomon built the house, and finished it."
1 Kings,6,15,"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house"
1 Kings,6,16,"And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place."
1 Kings,6,17,"And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long."
1 Kings,6,18,And the cedar of the house
1 Kings,6,19,And the
1 Kings,6,20,"And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in"
1 Kings,6,21,So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before
1 Kings,6,22,"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold. The Cherubim (2 Chronicles 3:10–13)"
1 Kings,6,23,"And within the oracle he made two cherubim of olive tree, each ten cubits high."
1 Kings,6,24,"And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part"
1 Kings,6,25,And the other cherub was ten
1 Kings,6,26,The hight of the one cherub was ten
1 Kings,6,27,"And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of"
1 Kings,6,28,And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1 Kings,6,29,"And he carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim, and palm trees,"
1 Kings,6,30,"And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. The Doors"
1 Kings,6,31,And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side-posts were a fifth
1 Kings,6,32,"The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees."
1 Kings,6,33,So also he made for the door of the temple posts of olive tree a fourth part of the wall.
1 Kings,6,34,"And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other"
1 Kings,6,35,"And he carved thereon cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers; and covered them with gold, fitted upon the carved work. The Courtyard"
1 Kings,6,36,"And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams."
1 Kings,6,37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:"
1 Kings,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul (which is the eighth month) was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it."
1 Kings,7,1,"But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house."
1 Kings,7,2,"He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was a hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and"
1 Kings,7,3,And it was
1 Kings,7,4,And there
1 Kings,7,5,"And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks."
1 Kings,7,6,"And he made a porch of pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beams were before them."
1 Kings,7,7,"Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other."
1 Kings,7,8,"And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also a house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married, like to this porch."
1 Kings,7,9,"All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside towards the great court."
1 Kings,7,10,"And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones; stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight"
1 Kings,7,11,"And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewn stones, and cedars."
1 Kings,7,12,"And the great court around was with three rows of hewn stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house. The Pillars and Capitals (2 Chronicles 3:14–17)"
1 Kings,7,13,And king Solomon sent and brought Hiram out of Tyre.
1 Kings,7,14,"He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and ingenious to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work."
1 Kings,7,15,"For he cast two pillars of brass, each of eighteen cubits high: and a line of twelve cubits did"
1 Kings,7,16,"And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the hight of the one capital was five cubits, and the hight of the other capital was five cubits:"
1 Kings,7,17,"And nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of"

1 Kings,7,21,"And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and"
1 Kings,7,22,And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished. The Molten Sea (2 Chronicles 4:1–5)
1 Kings,7,23,"And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was entirely round, and its"

1 Kings,7,25,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east:"
1 Kings,7,26,"And it was a hand- breadth thick, and its brim was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths. The Ten Bronze Stands"
1 Kings,7,27,"And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth"
1 Kings,7,28,And the work of the bases was in this manner: They had
1 Kings,7,29,"And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions"
1 Kings,7,30,"And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners of it had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten,"
1 Kings,7,31,"And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: but the mouth of it was round after the work of the base, a cubit and a half: and also upon the mouth of it"
1 Kings,7,32,And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the hight of a wheel was a cubit and half
1 Kings,7,33,"And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their"
1 Kings,7,34,And there were four undersetters to the

1 Kings,7,37,"After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size. The Ten Bronze Basins (2 Chronicles 4:6–8)"
1 Kings,7,38,Then he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits:
1 Kings,7,39,"And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south. Completion of the Bronze Works (2 Chronicles 4:11–18)"

1 Kings,7,51,"So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, he placed among the treasures of the house of the LORD."
1 Kings,8,1,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring the ark of the covenant"
1 Kings,8,2,And all the men of Israel assembled themselves
1 Kings,8,3,And all the elders of

1 Kings,8,6,"And the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the oracle"
1 Kings,8,7,"For the cherubim spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staffs thereof"
1 Kings,8,8,"And they drew out the staffs, that the ends of the staffs were seen out in the holy place before"
1 Kings,8,9,"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses deposited there at Horeb, when the LORD made a"
1 Kings,8,10,"And it came to pass,"
1 Kings,8,11,So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD. Solomon Blesses the LORD (2 Chronicles 6:1–11)
1 Kings,8,12,"Then spoke Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness."
1 Kings,8,13,"I have surely built thee a house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever."

Ezra,9,10,"And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,"

Ezra,9,12,"Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever."

Nehemiah,4,5,"And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders."
Nehemiah,4,6,"So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half of it, for the people had a mind to work."
Nehemiah,4,7,"But it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were set up, and that the breaches began to be stopped,"
Nehemiah,4,8,"And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it. Discouragement Overcome"
Nehemiah,4,9,"Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them."
Nehemiah,4,10,"And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall."
Nehemiah,4,11,"And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them,"
Nehemiah,4,12,"And it came to pass, that when the Jews who dwelt by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return to us they will be upon"

Nehemiah,4,23,"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing."
Nehemiah,5,1,And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
Nehemiah,5,2,"For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that"
Nehemiah,5,3,"Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and"
Nehemiah,5,4,"There were also that said, We have borrowed"
Nehemiah,5,5,"Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,6,And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
Nehemiah,5,7,"Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact interest, every one of his brother. And"
Nehemiah,5,8,"And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold to the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be"

Nehemiah,5,12,"Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that"

Nehemiah,6,3,"And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why"
Nehemiah,6,4,Yet they sent to me four times after

Nehemiah,6,9,"For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it may not be done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands."
Nehemiah,6,10,"Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors"

Nehemiah,6,15,"So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days."
Nehemiah,6,16,"And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard of it, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was"

Nehemiah,9,4,"Then stood upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise."

Nehemiah,9,7,"Thou art the LORD the God, who chosest Abram, and broughtest him forth from Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;"
Nehemiah,9,8,"And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him, to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:"
Nehemiah,9,9,"And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;"
Nehemiah,9,10,"And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"Moreover, thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way in which they should go."
Nehemiah,9,13,"Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spokest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:"
Nehemiah,9,14,"And madest known to them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:"
Nehemiah,9,15,"And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them."
Nehemiah,9,16,"But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,"
Nehemiah,9,17,"And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst perform among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not."
Nehemiah,9,18,"Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;"
Nehemiah,9,19,"Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go."
Nehemiah,9,20,"Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah,9,21,"Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes grew not old, and their feet swelled not."
Nehemiah,9,22,"Moreover, thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it."
Nehemiah,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would."
Nehemiah,9,25,"And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards and olive-yards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they ate and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"Nevertheless, they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets who testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations."
Nehemiah,9,27,"Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to thee, thou hearedest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them deliverers, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned and cried to thee, thou hearedest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;"
Nehemiah,9,29,"And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again to thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man doeth, he shall live in them:) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."
Nehemiah,9,30,"Yet many years didst thou forbear over them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore thou gavest them into the hand of the people of the lands."
Nehemiah,9,31,"Nevertheless, for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God."
Nehemiah,9,32,"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"But thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:"
Nehemiah,9,34,"Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened to thy commandments and thy testimonies, with which thou didst testify against them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works."
Nehemiah,9,36,"Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good of it, behold, we are servants in it:"
Nehemiah,9,37,"And it yieldeth much increase to the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress."
Nehemiah,9,38,"And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, set their seals to it."

Nehemiah,13,19,"And it came to pass, that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on"

Nehemiah,13,23,"In those days also I saw Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:"
Nehemiah,13,24,"And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews language, but"

Nehemiah,13,28,"And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest,"
Nehemiah,13,29,"Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites."
Nehemiah,13,30,"Thus I cleansed them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites,"
Nehemiah,13,31,"And for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good."
Esther,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to"

Esther,1,4,"When he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and eighty days."
Esther,1,5,"And when these days had expired, the king made a feast for all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both for great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s"

Esther,1,9,Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the"

Esther,1,12,"But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him. Queen Vashti Deposed"
Esther,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king’s manner towards all"
Esther,1,14,"And the next to him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and who sat"
Esther,1,15,"What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath"
Esther,1,16,"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but"
Esther,1,17,"For this deed of the queen will come abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in"
Esther,1,18,"Likewise will the ladies of Persia and Media say this day to all the king’s princes, who have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus will there arise too much contempt and"
Esther,1,19,"If it pleaseth the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king"
Esther,1,20,"And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small."
Esther,1,21,And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
Esther,1,22,"For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people."
Esther,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and"
Esther,2,2,Then said the king’s servants that ministered
Esther,2,3,"And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may collect all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, into the custody of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let"
Esther,2,4,And let the maiden who pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so. Esther Finds Favor
Esther,2,5,"Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the"
Esther,2,6,"Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of"
Esther,2,7,"And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter."
Esther,2,8,"So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree were heard, and when many maidens were assembled at Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also"
Esther,2,9,"And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens who were meet to be given her, out of the king’s house: and"
Esther,2,10,Esther had not showed
Esther,2,11,"And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her."
Esther,2,12,"Now when every maid’s turn had come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors, and with other"
Esther,2,13,Then thus came every maiden to the king; whatever she
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in to the king no more, except that the king delighted in her, and she was called by name."
Esther,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, had come to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them"
Esther,2,16,"So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. Esther Becomes Queen"
Esther,2,17,"And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of"
Esther,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king."
Esther,2,19,"And when the virgins were assembled the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate."
Esther,2,20,"Esther had not yet showed her kindred, nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther performed the commandment of Mordecai, as when she was brought up with him. Mordecai Uncovers a Conspiracy"
Esther,2,21,"In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and"
Esther,2,22,"And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it to Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king of it in"
Esther,2,23,"And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was discovered; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king."
Esther,3,1,"After these things king Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and"
Esther,3,2,"And all the king’s servants that were in the king’s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman; for the king had so commanded"
Esther,3,3,Then the king’s servants who were

Esther,3,7,"In the first month, (that is, the month Nisan,) in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that"
Esther,3,8,"And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from"
Esther,3,9,"If it shall please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries."
Esther,3,10,"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite,"
Esther,3,11,"And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee."
Esther,3,12,"Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded to the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province, according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed"
Esther,3,13,"And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them"
Esther,3,14,"The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province, was published"
Esther,3,15,"The posts departed, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed."
Esther,4,1,"When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with"
Esther,4,2,And came even
Esther,4,3,"And in every province whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,"So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told it to her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he"
Esther,4,5,"Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was."
Esther,4,6,"So Hatach went forth to Mordecai, to the street of the city, which was before the king’s gate."
Esther,4,7,"And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised"
Esther,4,8,"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him for her people."
Esther,4,9,And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther,4,10,"Again Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave"
Esther,4,11,"All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except him to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days."
Esther,4,12,And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
Esther,4,13,"Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the"
Esther,4,14,"For if thou shalt altogether hold thy peace at this time, then will there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house will be destroyed: and who knoweth, whether thou hast come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
Esther,4,15,"Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,"
Esther,4,16,"Go, assemble all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in to the king, which is not according to the law; and if I"
Esther,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."
Esther,5,1,"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the"
Esther,5,2,"And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden"
Esther,5,3,"Then said the king to her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the"
Esther,5,4,"And Esther answered, If it shall seem good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him."
Esther,5,5,"Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and"
Esther,5,6,"And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of"
Esther,5,7,"Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:"
Esther,5,8,"If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it shall please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said. Haman’s Plot against Mordecai"
Esther,5,9,"Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai."
Esther,5,10,"Nevertheless, Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends,"
Esther,5,11,"And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the"
Esther,5,12,"Haman said moreover, Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow I am invited to her also"
Esther,5,13,"Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s"
Esther,5,14,"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and to-morrow speak thou to the king that Mordecai may be hanged upon it: then go thou in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made."
Esther,6,1,"In that night the king could not sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the"
Esther,6,2,"And it was found written, that Mordecai had informed of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay"
Esther,6,3,"And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been done to Mordecai"
Esther,6,4,"And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman had come into the outward court of the king’s house, to"
Esther,6,5,And the king’s
Esther,6,6,"So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to"
Esther,6,7,"And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,"
Esther,6,8,"Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and"
Esther,6,9,"And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delighteth to honor, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor."
Esther,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast"
Esther,6,11,"Then Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor."
Esther,6,12,"And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having"
Esther,6,13,"And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife to him, If Mordecai is of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou wilt not prevail against him, but wilt surely fall before him."
Esther,6,14,"And while they were yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
Esther,7,2,"And the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted"
Esther,7,3,"Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it shall please the king,"
Esther,7,4,"For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bond-men and bond-"
Esther,7,5,"Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst"
Esther,7,6,"And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. The Hanging of Haman"
Esther,7,7,And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace-garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined
Esther,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace-garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen upon the bed on which Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered"
Esther,7,9,"And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in"
Esther,7,10,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.
Esther,8,1,"On that day the king Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews’ enemy, to Esther the queen."
Esther,8,2,"And the king took off his ring which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
Esther,8,3,"And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews."
Esther,8,4,"Then the king held out the golden scepter towards Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,"
Esther,8,5,"And said, If it shall please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing shall seem right before the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the"
Esther,8,6,For how can I endure to see the evil that will come to my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred? The Decree of Xerxes
Esther,8,7,"Then the king Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"Write ye also for the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring: for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, no man may reverse."
Esther,8,9,"Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day of it; and it was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India to Cush, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, to every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their"
Esther,8,10,"And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’s name, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent"
Esther,8,11,"In which the king granted the Jews who were in every city to assemble, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both"
Esther,8,12,Upon one day in all the provinces of
Esther,8,13,"The copy of the writing for a commandment, to be given in every province was published to all people, and"
Esther,8,14,"So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace."
Esther,8,15,"And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced, and"
Esther,8,16,"The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor."
Esther,8,17,"And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them."
Esther,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule"
Esther,9,2,"The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the"
Esther,9,3,"And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the"
Esther,9,4,"For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this"
Esther,9,5,Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of
Esther,9,6,And in
Esther,9,7,"And Parshandatha, and Dalphon,"
Esther,9,8,"And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,"
Esther,9,9,"And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and"
Esther,9,10,"The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, they slew; but on the spoil they laid not their hand. Haman’s Sons Hanged"
Esther,9,11,On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
Esther,9,12,"And the king said to Esther the queen, the Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and"
Esther,9,13,"Then said Esther, If it shall please the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according to this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged"
Esther,9,14,And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan;
Esther,9,15,"For the Jews that were in Shushan assembled on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand."
Esther,9,16,"But the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces assembled, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, (but they laid not their hands"
Esther,9,17,"On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. The Feast of Purim Instituted"
Esther,9,18,"But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled on the thirteenth day of the month, and on the fourteenth of it: and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and"
Esther,9,19,"Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another."
Esther,9,20,"And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews that were in all the provinces of"
Esther,9,21,"To establish this among them, that they should keep the"
Esther,9,22,"As the days in which the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day, that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor."
Esther,9,23,"And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them;"
Esther,9,24,"Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews"
Esther,9,25,"But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows."
Esther,9,26,Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this
Esther,9,27,"The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves to them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and"
Esther,9,28,"And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed."
Esther,9,29,"Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to"
Esther,9,30,"And he sent the letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty"
Esther,9,31,"To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings"
Esther,9,32,And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
Esther,10,1,"And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea."
Esther,10,2,"And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king"
Esther,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew was next to king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed."

Job,1,5,"And it was so, when the days of their feasting were ended, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. Satan’s First Attack"
Job,1,6,"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan"
Job,1,7,"And the LORD said to Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered"
Job,1,8,"And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth,"
Job,1,9,Then Satan answered the

Job,1,11,"But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he"
Job,1,12,"And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD. Job Loses His Children and Possessions"

Job,1,19,"And behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee."
Job,1,20,"Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshiped,"
Job,1,21,"And said, Naked came I from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."
Job,1,22,"In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly."
Job,2,1,"Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan"
Job,2,2,"And the LORD said to Satan, Whence comest thou? and Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from"
Job,2,3,"And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him"
Job,2,4,"And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, even, all that a man hath will"
Job,2,5,"But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse"
Job,2,6,"And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; but save his life."
Job,2,7,"So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of"
Job,2,8,And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself with it; and he sat down among the ashes.
Job,2,9,"Then said his wife to him, Dost thou still retain thy integrity? curse God, and die."
Job,2,10,"But he said to her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. Job’s Three Friends"
Job,2,11,"Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for"
Job,2,12,"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they raised their voice, and wept; and they rent"
Job,2,13,"So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him: for they saw that his grief was very great."
Job,3,1,"After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day."
Job,3,2,"And Job spoke, and said,"
Job,3,3,"Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a mail child conceived."
Job,3,4,"Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it."
Job,3,5,Let darkness and the shades of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
Job,3,6,"As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined to the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months."
Job,3,7,"Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein."
Job,3,8,"Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning."
Job,3,9,"Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:"
Job,3,10,"Because it prevented not my birth, nor hid sorrow from my eyes."
Job,3,11,Why died I not from the womb? why did I not expire at the time of my birth?
Job,3,12,Why did the knees receive me? or why the breasts that I should be nursed?
Job,3,13,"For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,"
Job,3,14,"With kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;"
Job,3,15,"Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:"
Job,3,16,Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
Job,3,17,There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary are at rest.
Job,3,18,There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
Job,3,19,The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
Job,3,20,"Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul;"
Job,3,21,"Who long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;"
Job,3,22,"Who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?"
Job,3,23,"Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?"
Job,3,24,"For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters."
Job,3,25,"For the thing which I greatly feared hath come upon me, and that which I dreaded hath come to me."
Job,3,26,"I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came."
Job,4,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,"
Job,4,2,"If we essay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can refrain from speaking?"
Job,4,3,"Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands."
Job,4,4,"Thy words have upheld him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees."
Job,4,5,"But now it hath come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled."
Job,4,6,"Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?"
Job,4,7,"Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off;"
Job,4,8,"Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same."
Job,4,9,"By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed."
Job,4,10,"The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken."
Job,4,11,"The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad."
Job,4,12,"Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a small sound of it."
Job,4,13,"In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men."
Job,4,14,"Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake."
Job,4,15,Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
Job,4,16,"It stood still, but I could not discern its form: an image was before my eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,"
Job,4,17,Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
Job,4,18,"Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:"
Job,4,19,"How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth?"
Job,4,20,They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
Job,4,21,"Doth not their excellence which is in them depart? they die, even without wisdom."
Job,5,1,"Call now, if there is any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?"
Job,5,2,"For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one."
Job,5,3,I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
Job,5,4,"His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them."
Job,5,5,"Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance."
Job,5,6,"Although affliction cometh not forth from the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;"
Job,5,7,"Yet man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward."
Job,5,8,"I would seek to God, and to God would I commit my cause:"
Job,5,9,Who doeth great things and unsearchable; wonderful things without number:
Job,5,10,"Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:"
Job,5,11,To set on high those that are low: that those who mourn may be exalted to safety.
Job,5,12,"He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise."
Job,5,13,He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
Job,5,14,"They meet with darkness in the day-time, and grope in the noon-day as in the night."
Job,5,15,"But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty."
Job,5,16,"So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth."
Job,5,17,"Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:"
Job,5,18,"For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole."
Job,5,19,"He will deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee."
Job,5,20,In famine he will redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
Job,5,21,Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
Job,5,22,At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
Job,5,23,For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
Job,5,24,"And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle will be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin."
Job,5,25,"Thou shalt know also that thy seed will be great, and thy offspring as the grass of the earth."
Job,5,26,"Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, as a shock of corn cometh in in its season."
Job,5,27,"Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good."
Job,6,1,"But Job answered and said,"
Job,6,2,"Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!"
Job,6,3,For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
Job,6,4,"For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison of which drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God set themselves in array against me."
Job,6,5,Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
Job,6,6,Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
Job,6,7,The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful food.
Job,6,8,Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
Job,6,9,"Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!"
Job,6,10,"Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One."
Job,6,11,"What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is my end, that I should prolong my life?"
Job,6,12,Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
Job,6,13,Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
Job,6,14,To him that is afflicted pity should be shown from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
Job,6,15,"My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;"
Job,6,16,"Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and in which the snow is hid:"
Job,6,17,"In the time when they become warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place."
Job,6,18,"The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish."
Job,6,19,"The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them."
Job,6,20,"They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed."
Job,6,21,"For now ye are nothing: ye see my casting down, and are afraid."
Job,6,22,"Did I say, Bring to me? or Give a reward for me of your substance?"
Job,6,23,"Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?"
Job,6,24,"Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand in what I have erred."
Job,6,25,How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
Job,6,26,"Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?"
Job,6,27,"Yes, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend."
Job,6,28,"Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident to you if I lie."
Job,6,29,"Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness is in it."
Job,6,30,Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
Job,7,1,Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of a hireling?
Job,7,2,"As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as a hireling looketh for the reward of his work;"
Job,7,3,"So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me."
Job,7,4,"When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day."
Job,7,5,My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and become lothsome.
Job,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope."
Job,7,7,O remember that my life is wind: my eye will no more see good.
Job,7,8,"The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thy eyes are upon me, and I am not."
Job,7,9,As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
Job,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more."
Job,7,11,Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,7,12,"Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?"
Job,7,13,"When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;"
Job,7,14,"Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:"
Job,7,15,"So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life."
Job,7,16,I lothe it; I would not live always: let me alone; for my days are vanity.
Job,7,17,"What is man, that thou shouldst magnify him? and that thou shouldst set thy heart upon him?"
Job,7,18,"And that thou shouldst visit him every morning, and try him every moment?"
Job,7,19,"How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow my spittle?"
Job,7,20,"I have sinned; what shall I do to thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?"
Job,7,21,"And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be."
Job,8,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
Job,8,2,How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
Job,8,3,Doth God pervert judgment; or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
Job,8,4,"If thy children have sinned against him, and he hath cast them away for their transgression;"
Job,8,5,"If thou wouldst seek to God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;"
Job,8,6,"If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous."
Job,8,7,"Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end would greatly increase."
Job,8,8,"For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 9(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)"
Job,8,10,"Will they not teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?"
Job,8,11,Can the rush grow without mire? can the flag grow without water?
Job,8,12,"Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb."
Job,8,13,So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish:
Job,8,14,"Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider’s web."
Job,8,15,"He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure."
Job,8,16,"He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden."
Job,8,17,"His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones."
Job,8,18,"If he shall destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee."
Job,8,19,"Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow."
Job,8,20,"Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:"
Job,8,21,"Till he shall fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing."
Job,8,22,They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to naught.
Job,9,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,9,2,I know it to be so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?
Job,9,3,"If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand."
Job,9,4,"He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?"
Job,9,5,"Who removeth the mountains, and they know not: who overturneth them in his anger."
Job,9,6,"Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and its pillars tremble."
Job,9,7,"Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars."
Job,9,8,"Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea."
Job,9,9,"Who maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south."
Job,9,10,"Who doeth great things past finding out; yes, and wonders without number."
Job,9,11,"Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not."
Job,9,12,"Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say to him, What doest thou?"
Job,9,13,"If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him."
Job,9,14,"How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?"
Job,9,15,"Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge."
Job,9,16,"If I had called, and he had answered me; yet I would not believe that he had hearkened to my voice."
Job,9,17,"For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause."
Job,9,18,"He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness."
Job,9,19,"If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?"
Job,9,20,"If I justify myself, my own mouth will condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, that also will prove me perverse."
Job,9,21,"Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life."
Job,9,22,"This is one thing, therefore I said it, he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked."
Job,9,23,"If the scourge shall slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent."
Job,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of its judges; if not, where, and who is he?"
Job,9,25,"Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good."
Job,9,26,They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.
Job,9,27,"If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:"
Job,9,28,"I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent."
Job,9,29,"If I am wicked, why then do I labor in vain?"
Job,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;"
Job,9,31,"Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, and my own clothes shall abhor me."
Job,9,32,"For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment."
Job,9,33,"Neither is there any judge between us, that might lay his hand upon us both."
Job,9,34,"Let him take away his rod from me, and let not his fear terrify me:"
Job,9,35,"Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me."
Job,10,1,My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,10,2,"I will say to God, Do not condemn me; show me why thou contendest with me."
Job,10,3,"Is it good to thee that thou shouldst oppress, that thou shouldst despise the work of thy hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?
Job,10,5,"Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man’s days,"
Job,10,6,"That thou inquirest after my iniquity, and searchest after my sin?"
Job,10,7,Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thy hand.
Job,10,8,Thy hands have made me and fashioned me in all my parts; yet thou dost destroy me.
Job,10,9,"Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?"
Job,10,10,"Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?"
Job,10,11,"Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews."
Job,10,12,"Thou hast granted me life and favor, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit."
Job,10,13,And these things hast thou hid in thy heart: I know that this is with thee.
Job,10,14,"If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from my iniquity."
Job,10,15,"If I be wicked, woe to me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou my affliction;"
Job,10,16,For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou showest thyself wonderful upon me.
Job,10,17,"Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thy indignation upon me; changes and war are against me."
Job,10,18,"Why then hast thou brought me forth from the womb? O that I had expired, and no eye had seen me!"
Job,10,19,I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job,10,20,"Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,"
Job,10,21,"Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness, and the shades of death;"
Job,10,22,"A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shades of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness."
Job,11,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
Job,11,2,Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
Job,11,3,"Should thy falsehoods make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?"
Job,11,4,"For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thy eyes."
Job,11,5,"But Oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;"
Job,11,6,"And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thy iniquity deserveth."
Job,11,7,Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?
Job,11,8,It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
Job,11,9,"The measure of it is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea."
Job,11,10,"If he shall cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?"
Job,11,11,For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?
Job,11,12,"For vain man would be wise, though man is born like a wild ass’s colt."
Job,11,13,"If thou preparest thy heart, and stretchest out thy hands towards him;"
Job,11,14,"If iniquity is in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles."
Job,11,15,"For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yes, thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear:"
Job,11,16,"Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:"
Job,11,17,"And thy age shall be clearer than the noon-day: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning."
Job,11,18,"And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yes, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety."
Job,11,19,"Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yes, many shall make suit to thee."
Job,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the expiration of the breath."
Job,12,1,"And Job answered and said,"
Job,12,2,"No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you."
Job,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yes, who knoweth not such things as these?"
Job,12,4,"I am as one mocked by his neighbor, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is derided."
Job,12,5,He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
Job,12,6,"The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly."
Job,12,7,"But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:"
Job,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare to thee."
Job,12,9,Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
Job,12,10,"In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind."
Job,12,11,Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste its food?
Job,12,12,With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
Job,12,13,"With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding."
Job,12,14,"Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening."
Job,12,15,"Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth."
Job,12,16,With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.
Job,12,17,"He leadeth counselors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools."
Job,12,18,"He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle."
Job,12,19,"He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty."
Job,12,20,"He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged."
Job,12,21,"He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty."
Job,12,22,"He revealeth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth to light the shades of death."
Job,12,23,"He increaseth nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth nations, and straiteneth them again."
Job,12,24,"He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way."
Job,12,25,"They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man."
Job,13,1,"Lo, my eye hath seen all this, my ear hath heard and understood it."
Job,13,2,"What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior to you."
Job,13,3,"Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God."
Job,13,4,"But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value."
Job,13,5,O that ye would altogether hold your peace and it would be your wisdom.
Job,13,6,"Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips."
Job,13,7,Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
Job,13,8,Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
Job,13,9,"Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?"
Job,13,10,"He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons."
Job,13,11,Shall not his excellence make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
Job,13,12,"Your remembrances are like to ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay."
Job,13,13,"Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will."
Job,13,14,"Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?"
Job,13,15,"Though he shall slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him."
Job,13,16,He also shall be my salvation: for a hypocrite shall not come before him.
Job,13,17,"Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears."
Job,13,18,"Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified."
Job,13,19,"Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall expire."
Job,13,20,Only do not two things to me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
Job,13,21,Withdraw thy hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
Job,13,22,"Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me."
Job,13,23,How many are my iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
Job,13,24,"Why hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thy enemy?"
Job,13,25,Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
Job,13,26,"For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth."
Job,13,27,"Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly to all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet."
Job,13,28,"And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth-eaten."
Job,14,1,"Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble."
Job,14,2,"He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not."
Job,14,3,"And dost thou open thy eyes upon such one, and bring me into judgment with thee?"
Job,14,4,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
Job,14,5,"Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;"
Job,14,6,"Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day."
Job,14,7,"For there is hope of a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its tender branch will not cease."
Job,14,8,"Though its root shall become old in the earth, and its stock die in the ground;"
Job,14,9,"Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant."
Job,14,10,"But man dieth, and wasteth away: yes, man yieldeth his breath, and where is he?"
Job,14,11,"As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:"
Job,14,12,"So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens shall be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep."
Job,14,13,"O that thou wouldst hide me in the grave, that thou wouldst keep me secret, until thy wrath is past, that thou wouldst appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
Job,14,14,"If a man dieth, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change shall come."
Job,14,15,"Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thy hands."
Job,14,16,For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?
Job,14,17,"My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up my iniquity."
Job,14,18,"And surely the mountain falling cometh to naught, and the rock is removed out of its place."
Job,14,19,The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.
Job,14,20,"Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away."
Job,14,21,"His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them."
Job,14,22,"But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn."
Job,15,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,"
Job,15,2,"Should a wise men utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?"
Job,15,3,Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches with which he can do no good?
Job,15,4,"Yes, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God."
Job,15,5,"For thy mouth uttereth thy iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty."
Job,15,6,"Thy own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yes, thy own lips testify against thee."
Job,15,7,Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?
Job,15,8,Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
Job,15,9,"What knowest thou that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?"
Job,15,10,"With us are both the gray headed and very aged men, much older than thy father."
Job,15,11,Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
Job,15,12,"Why doth thy heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,"
Job,15,13,"That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?"
Job,15,14,"What is man, that he should be clean? and he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
Job,15,15,"Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight."
Job,15,16,"How much more abominable and filthy is man, who drinketh iniquity like water?"
Job,15,17,"I will show thee, hear me; and that which I have seen, I will declare;"
Job,15,18,"Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:"
Job,15,19,"To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them."
Job,15,20,"The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor."
Job,15,21,A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
Job,15,22,"He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for by the sword."
Job,15,23,"He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand."
Job,15,24,"Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle."
Job,15,25,"For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty."
Job,15,26,"He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:"
Job,15,27,"Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks."
Job,15,28,"And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps."
Job,15,29,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection of it upon the earth."
Job,15,30,"He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away."
Job,15,31,Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompense.
Job,15,32,"It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green."
Job,15,33,"He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive."
Job,15,34,"For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery."
Job,15,35,"They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit."
Job,16,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,16,2,I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
Job,16,3,Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
Job,16,4,"I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you."
Job,16,5,But I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.
Job,16,6,"Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?"
Job,16,7,But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
Job,16,8,"And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face."
Job,16,9,"He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; my enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me."
Job,16,10,They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves against me.
Job,16,11,"God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked."
Job,16,12,"I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark."
Job,16,13,"His archers encompass me; he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground."
Job,16,14,"He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant."
Job,16,15,"I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust."
Job,16,16,"My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids are the shades of death;"
Job,16,17,Not for any injustice in my hands: also my prayer is pure.
Job,16,18,"O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place."
Job,16,19,"Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high."
Job,16,20,My friends scorn me: but my eye poureth out tears to God.
Job,16,21,"O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbor!"
Job,16,22,"When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return."
Job,17,1,"My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me."
Job,17,2,Are there not mockers with me? and doth not my eye continue in their provocation?
Job,17,3,"Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?"
Job,17,4,For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
Job,17,5,"He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail."
Job,17,6,He hath made me also a by-word of the people; and in former time I was as a tabret.
Job,17,7,"My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shade."
Job,17,8,"Upright men shall be astonished at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite."
Job,17,9,"The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger."
Job,17,10,"But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you."
Job,17,11,"My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart."
Job,17,12,They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.
Job,17,13,"If I wait, the grave is my house: I have made my bed in the darkness."
Job,17,14,"I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister."
Job,17,15,"And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who will see it?"
Job,17,16,"They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust."
Job,18,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
Job,18,2,"How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak."
Job,18,3,"Why are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?"
Job,18,4,He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of its place?
Job,18,5,"Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine."
Job,18,6,"The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him."
Job,18,7,"The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down."
Job,18,8,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare."
Job,18,9,"The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him."
Job,18,10,"The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way."
Job,18,11,"Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet."
Job,18,12,"His strength shall be hunger-bitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side."
Job,18,13,It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the first-born of death shall devour his strength.
Job,18,14,"His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors."
Job,18,15,"It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation."
Job,18,16,"His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off."
Job,18,17,"His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street."
Job,18,18,"He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world."
Job,18,19,"He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings."
Job,18,20,"They that come after him shall be astonished at his day, as they that went before were affrighted."
Job,18,21,"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God."
Job,19,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,19,2,"How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?"
Job,19,3,These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.
Job,19,4,"And be it indeed that I have erred, my error remaineth with myself."
Job,19,5,"If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:"
Job,19,6,"Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath encompassed me with his net."
Job,19,7,"Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment."
Job,19,8,"He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths."
Job,19,9,"He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head."
Job,19,10,"He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and my hope hath he removed like a tree."
Job,19,11,"He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me to him as one of his enemies."
Job,19,12,"His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp around my tabernacle."
Job,19,13,"He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance are verily estranged from me."
Job,19,14,"My kinsmen have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me."
Job,19,15,"They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight."
Job,19,16,"I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I entreated him with my mouth."
Job,19,17,"My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the children’s sake of my own body."
Job,19,18,"Yes, young children despised me; I arose, and they spoke against me."
Job,19,19,All my intimate friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
Job,19,20,"My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth."
Job,19,21,"Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me."
Job,19,22,"Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?"
Job,19,23,Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
Job,19,24,"That they were graven with an iron pen in lead, in the rock for ever!"
Job,19,25,"For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he will stand at the latter day upon the earth:"
Job,19,26,"And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:"
Job,19,27,"Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me."
Job,19,28,"But ye would say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?"
Job,19,29,"Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment."
Job,20,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
Job,20,2,"Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste."
Job,20,3,"I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer."
Job,20,4,"Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,"
Job,20,5,"That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?"
Job,20,6,"Though his excellence shall mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds;"
Job,20,7,"Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they who have seen him shall say, Where is he?"
Job,20,8,"He shall fly away as a dream, and will not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night."
Job,20,9,The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
Job,20,10,"His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods."
Job,20,11,"His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust."
Job,20,12,"Though wickedness may be sweet in his mouth, though he may hide it under his tongue;"
Job,20,13,"Though he may spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:"
Job,20,14,"Yet his food in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him."
Job,20,15,"He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly."
Job,20,16,He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.
Job,20,17,"He shall not see the river, the floods, the brooks of honey and buttermilk."
Job,20,18,"That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice in it."
Job,20,19,Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away a house which he did not build.
Job,20,20,"Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired."
Job,20,21,There shall none of his food be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
Job,20,22,In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
Job,20,23,"When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating."
Job,20,24,"He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through."
Job,20,25,"It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yes, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him."
Job,20,26,All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
Job,20,27,The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
Job,20,28,"The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath."
Job,20,29,"This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God."
Job,21,1,"But Job answered and said,"
Job,21,2,"Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations."
Job,21,3,"Suffer me that I may speak; and after I have spoken, mock on."
Job,21,4,"As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?"
Job,21,5,"Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth."
Job,21,6,"Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh."
Job,21,7,"Why do the wicked live, become old, and, are mighty in power?"
Job,21,8,"Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes."
Job,21,9,"Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them."
Job,21,10,"Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf."
Job,21,11,"They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance."
Job,21,12,"They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ."
Job,21,13,"They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave."
Job,21,14,"Therefore they say to God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways."
Job,21,15,"What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray to him?"
Job,21,16,"Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
Job,21,17,How oft is the candle of the wicked put out? and how oft cometh their destruction upon them? God distributeth sorrows in his anger.
Job,21,18,"They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away."
Job,21,19,"God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it."
Job,21,20,"His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
Job,21,21,"For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?"
Job,21,22,Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
Job,21,23,"One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet."
Job,21,24,"His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow."
Job,21,25,"And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure."
Job,21,26,"They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them."
Job,21,27,"Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me."
Job,21,28,"For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?"
Job,21,29,"Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,"
Job,21,30,That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they will be brought forth to the day of wrath.
Job,21,31,Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
Job,21,32,"Yet he shall be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb."
Job,21,33,"The clods of the valley will be sweet to him, and every man will draw after him, as there are innumerable before him."
Job,21,34,"How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?"
Job,22,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,"
Job,22,2,"Can a man be profitable to God, as he that is wise may be profitable to himself?"
Job,22,3,"Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?"
Job,22,4,Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?
Job,22,5,Is not thy wickedness great? and thy iniquities infinite?
Job,22,6,"For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for naught, and stripped the naked of their clothing."
Job,22,7,"Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withheld bread from the hungry."
Job,22,8,"But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honorable man dwelt in it."
Job,22,9,"Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken."
Job,22,10,"Therefore snares are around thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;"
Job,22,11,"Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee."
Job,22,12,"Is not God in the hight of heaven? and behold the hight of the stars, how high they are!"
Job,22,13,"And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?"
Job,22,14,"Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven."
Job,22,15,Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
Job,22,16,"Who were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflowed with a flood!"
Job,22,17,"Who said to God, depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them!"
Job,22,18,Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job,22,19,"The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent deride them."
Job,22,20,"Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth."
Job,22,21,"Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: by this good shall come to thee."
Job,22,22,"Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart."
Job,22,23,"If thou shalt return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles."
Job,22,24,"Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks."
Job,22,25,"Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defense and thou shalt have plenty of silver."
Job,22,26,"For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face to God."
Job,22,27,"Thou shalt make thy prayer to him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows."
Job,22,28,"Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established to thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways."
Job,22,29,"When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is exaltation; and he shall save the humble person."
Job,22,30,He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thy hands.
Job,23,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,23,2,Even to-day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
Job,23,3,Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!
Job,23,4,"I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments."
Job,23,5,"I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me."
Job,23,6,Would he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.
Job,23,7,There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
Job,23,8,"Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:"
Job,23,9,"On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:"
Job,23,10,"But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold."
Job,23,11,"My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined."
Job,23,12,Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
Job,23,13,"But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth."
Job,23,14,For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.
Job,23,15,"Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him."
Job,23,16,"For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:"
Job,23,17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face."
Job,24,1,"Why, seeing times are not hid from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?"
Job,24,2,"Some remove the landmarks: they violently take away flocks, and their feed."
Job,24,3,"They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge."
Job,24,4,They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
Job,24,5,"Behold, as wild asses in the desert, they go forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children."
Job,24,6,They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
Job,24,7,"They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold."
Job,24,8,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter."
Job,24,9,"They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor."
Job,24,10,"They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;"
Job,24,11,"Who make oil within their walls, and tread their wine-presses, and suffer thirst."
Job,24,12,"Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them."
Job,24,13,"They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not its ways, nor abide in its paths."
Job,24,14,"The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief."
Job,24,15,"The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face."
Job,24,16,"In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the day-time: they know not the light."
Job,24,17,"For the morning is to them even as the shades of death: if one knoweth them, they are in the terrors of the shades of death."
Job,24,18,He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
Job,24,19,Drouth and heat consume the snow-waters: so doth the grave those who have sinned.
Job,24,20,The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
Job,24,21,He oppresseth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.
Job,24,22,"He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life."
Job,24,23,"Though it is given him to be in safety, on which he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways."
Job,24,24,"They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all others, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn."
Job,24,25,"And if it is not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech of no worth?"
Job,25,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
Job,25,2,"Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places."
Job,25,3,Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
Job,25,4,How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
Job,25,5,"Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; and the stars are not pure in his sight."
Job,25,6,"How much less man, that is a worm; and the son of man, who is a worm?"
Job,26,1,"But Job answered and said,"
Job,26,2,How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
Job,26,3,How hast thou counseled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou abundantly declared the thing as it is?
Job,26,4,To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
Job,26,5,"Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof."
Job,26,6,"Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering."
Job,26,7,"He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing."
Job,26,8,He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
Job,26,9,"He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it."
Job,26,10,"He hath encompassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end."
Job,26,11,The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
Job,26,12,"He divideth the sea by his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud."
Job,26,13,By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
Job,26,14,"Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?"
Job,27,1,"Moreover, Job continued his parable, and said,"
Job,27,2,"As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty who hath afflicted my soul;"
Job,27,3,"All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;"
Job,27,4,"My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit."
Job,27,5,Far be it from me that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove my integrity from me.
Job,27,6,"My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. The Wicked Man’s Portion"
Job,27,7,"Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous."
Job,27,8,"For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?"
Job,27,9,Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
Job,27,10,Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
Job,27,11,I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
Job,27,12,"Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?"
Job,27,13,"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty."
Job,27,14,"If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread."
Job,27,15,Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
Job,27,16,"Though he should heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay?"
Job,27,17,"He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver."
Job,27,18,"He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh."
Job,27,19,"The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not."
Job,27,20,"Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night."
Job,27,21,"The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place."
Job,27,22,"For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand."
Job,27,23,"Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place."
Job,28,1,"Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it."
Job,28,2,"Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is melted out of the stone."
Job,28,3,"He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shades of death."
Job,28,4,"The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant: even the waters forgotten by the foot: they are dried up, they have gone away from men."
Job,28,5,"As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire."
Job,28,6,The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.
Job,28,7,"There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vultur’s eye hath not seen:"
Job,28,8,"The lion’s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it."
Job,28,9,He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
Job,28,10,He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
Job,28,11,He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid he bringeth forth to light.
Job,28,12,But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,13,Man knoweth not the price of it; neither is it found in the land of the living.
Job,28,14,"The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me."
Job,28,15,"It cannot be obtained for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price of it."
Job,28,16,"It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire."
Job,28,17,The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
Job,28,18,"No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies."
Job,28,19,"The topaz of Cush shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold."
Job,28,20,Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,21,"Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air."
Job,28,22,"Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame of it with our ears."
Job,28,23,"God understandeth the way of it, and he knoweth its place."
Job,28,24,"For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;"
Job,28,25,To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
Job,28,26,"When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:"
Job,28,27,"Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out."
Job,28,28,"And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding."
Job,29,1,"Moreover, Job continued his parable, and said,"
Job,29,2,"Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;"
Job,29,3,"When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;"
Job,29,4,"As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;"
Job,29,5,"When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;"
Job,29,6,"When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;"
Job,29,7,"When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!"
Job,29,8,"The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up."
Job,29,9,"The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth."
Job,29,10,"The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth."
Job,29,11,"When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:"
Job,29,12,"Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him."
Job,29,13,The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
Job,29,14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem."
Job,29,15,"I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame."
Job,29,16,I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.
Job,29,17,"And I broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth."
Job,29,18,"Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand."
Job,29,19,"My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch."
Job,29,20,"My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand."
Job,29,21,"To me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel."
Job,29,22,After my words they spoke not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
Job,29,23,And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
Job,29,24,"If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down."
Job,29,25,"I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners."
Job,30,1,"But now they that are younger than I, have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock."
Job,30,2,"Yes, to what might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age had perished?"
Job,30,3,For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
Job,30,4,"Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their food."
Job,30,5,"They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them, as after a thief;)"
Job,30,6,"To dwell in the clefts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks."
Job,30,7,Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were collected.
Job,30,8,"They were children of fools, yes, children of base men: they were viler than the earth."
Job,30,9,"And now I am their song, yes, I am their by-word."
Job,30,10,"They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face."
Job,30,11,"Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me."
Job,30,12,"Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction."
Job,30,13,"They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper."
Job,30,14,They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me. Job’s Prosperity Becomes Calamity
Job,30,15,Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
Job,30,16,And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
Job,30,17,My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
Job,30,18,By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
Job,30,19,"He hath cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes."
Job,30,20,"I cry to thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not."
Job,30,21,Thou hast become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
Job,30,22,"Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance."
Job,30,23,"For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living."
Job,30,24,"Yet he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction."
Job,30,25,Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?
Job,30,26,"When I looked for good, then evil came: and when I waited for light, there came darkness."
Job,30,27,"My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction came upon me."
Job,30,28,"I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation."
Job,30,29,"I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls."
Job,30,30,"My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat."
Job,30,31,"My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep."
Job,31,1,I Made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
Job,31,2,For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
Job,31,3,Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
Job,31,4,"Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?"
Job,31,5,"If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;"
Job,31,6,"Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity."
Job,31,7,"If my step hath turned out of the way, and my heart walked after my eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to my hands;"
Job,31,8,"Then let me sow, and let another eat; yes, let my offspring be rooted out."
Job,31,9,"If my heart hath been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door;"
Job,31,10,"Then let my wife grind to another, and let others bow down upon her."
Job,31,11,"For this is a hainous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges."
Job,31,12,"For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all my increase."
Job,31,13,"If I despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, when they contended with me;"
Job,31,14,"What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?"
Job,31,15,Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
Job,31,16,"If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;"
Job,31,17,"Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten of it; 18(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;)"
Job,31,19,"If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;"
Job,31,20,"If his loins have not blessed me, and if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;"
Job,31,21,"If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:"
Job,31,22,"Then let my arm fall from my shoulder-blade, and my arm be broken from the bone."
Job,31,23,"For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure."
Job,31,24,"If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;"
Job,31,25,"If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gained much;"
Job,31,26,"If I have beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;"
Job,31,27,"And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:"
Job,31,28,This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.
Job,31,29,"If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or have lifted up myself when evil found him:"
Job,31,30,Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
Job,31,31,"If the men of my tabernacle have not said, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied."
Job,31,32,The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveler.
Job,31,33,"If I have covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom:"
Job,31,34,"Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?"
Job,31,35,"Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that my adversary had written a book."
Job,31,36,"Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me."
Job,31,37,I would declare to him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near to him.
Job,31,38,"If my land crieth against me, or its furrows likewise complain;"
Job,31,39,"If I have eaten the fruits of it without money, or have caused its owners to lose their life:"
Job,31,40,"Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended."
Job,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his"
Job,32,3,Also against his three friends was his
Job,32,4,Now Elihu had waited
Job,32,5,"When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled."
Job,32,6,"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you my opinion."
Job,32,7,"I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom."
Job,32,8,But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
Job,32,9,Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
Job,32,10,"Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show my opinion."
Job,32,11,"Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say."
Job,32,12,"Yes, I attended to you, and behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:"
Job,32,13,"Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man."
Job,32,14,Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
Job,32,15,"They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking."
Job,32,16,"When I had waited, (for they spoke not, but stood still, and answered no more;)"
Job,32,17,"I said, I will answer also my part, I also will show my opinion."
Job,32,18,"For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me."
Job,32,19,"Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles."
Job,32,20,"I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer."
Job,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles to man."
Job,32,22,"For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing, my Maker would soon take me away."
Job,33,1,"Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words."
Job,33,2,"Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth."
Job,33,3,My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
Job,33,4,"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life."
Job,33,5,"If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up."
Job,33,6,"Behold, I am according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay."
Job,33,7,"Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee."
Job,33,8,"Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,"
Job,33,9,"I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me."
Job,33,10,"Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,"
Job,33,11,"He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths."
Job,33,12,"Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man."
Job,33,13,Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
Job,33,14,"For God speaketh once, yes twice, yet man perceiveth it not."
Job,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;"
Job,33,16,"Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,"
Job,33,17,"That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man."
Job,33,18,"He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword."
Job,33,19,"He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:"
Job,33,20,"So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food."
Job,33,21,"His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out."
Job,33,22,"Yes, his soul draweth near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers."
Job,33,23,"If there is a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness:"
Job,33,24,"Then he is gracious to him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom."
Job,33,25,His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he will return to the days of his youth:
Job,33,26,"He shall pray to God, and he will be favorable to him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render to man his righteousness."
Job,33,27,"He looketh upon men, and if any shall say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;"
Job,33,28,"He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light."
Job,33,29,"Lo, all these things God often worketh with man,"
Job,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living."
Job,33,31,"Mark well, O Job, hearken to me: hold thy peace, and I will speak."
Job,33,32,"If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee."
Job,33,33,"If not, hearken to me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom."
Job,34,1,"Furthermore Elihu answered and said,"
Job,34,2,"Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear to me, ye that have knowledge."
Job,34,3,"For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth food."
Job,34,4,Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job,34,5,"For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment."
Job,34,6,Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
Job,34,7,"What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?"
Job,34,8,"Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men."
Job,34,9,"For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God."
Job,34,10,"Therefore hearken to me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity."
Job,34,11,"For the work of a man he shall render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways."
Job,34,12,"Yes, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment."
Job,34,13,Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
Job,34,14,"If he should set his heart upon man, if he should gather to himself his spirit and his breath;"
Job,34,15,"All flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust."
Job,34,16,"If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words."
Job,34,17,Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
Job,34,18,"Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?"
Job,34,19,"How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands."
Job,34,20,"In a moment they shall die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand."
Job,34,21,"For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings."
Job,34,22,"There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
Job,34,23,For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
Job,34,24,"He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead."
Job,34,25,"Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed."
Job,34,26,He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
Job,34,27,"Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:"
Job,34,28,"So that they cause the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted."
Job,34,29,"When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:"
Job,34,30,"That the hypocrite may not reign, lest the people should be ensnared."
Job,34,31,"Surely it is meet to be said to God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:"
Job,34,32,"That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more."
Job,34,33,"Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou shalt refuse, or whether thou shalt choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest."
Job,34,34,"Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken to me."
Job,34,35,"Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom."
Job,34,36,"My desire is that Job may be tried to the end, because of his answers for wicked men."
Job,34,37,"For he addeth rebellion to his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God."
Job,35,1,"Elihu spoke moreover, and said,"
Job,35,2,"Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God’s?"
Job,35,3,"For thou saidst, What advantage will it be to thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?"
Job,35,4,"I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee."
Job,35,5,"Look to the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou."
Job,35,6,"If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions are multiplied, what doest thou to him?"
Job,35,7,"If thou art righteous, what givest thou to him? or what receiveth he from thy hand?"
Job,35,8,Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art: and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
Job,35,9,By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job,35,10,"But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;"
Job,35,11,"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?"
Job,35,12,"There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men."
Job,35,13,"Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it."
Job,35,14,"Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him."
Job,35,15,"But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:"
Job,35,16,Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
Job,36,1,"Elihu also proceeded, and said,"
Job,36,2,"Suffer me a little, and I will show thee that I have yet to speak on God’s behalf."
Job,36,3,"I will bring my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
Job,36,4,For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
Job,36,5,"Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom."
Job,36,6,He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
Job,36,7,"He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yes, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"And if they are bound in fetters, and are held in cords of affliction;"
Job,36,9,"Then he showeth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded."
Job,36,10,"He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity."
Job,36,11,"If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures."
Job,36,12,"But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge."
Job,36,13,But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
Job,36,14,"They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean."
Job,36,15,"He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression."
Job,36,16,"Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table would be full of fatness."
Job,36,17,But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
Job,36,18,"Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee."
Job,36,19,"Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength."
Job,36,20,"Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place."
Job,36,21,"Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction."
Job,36,22,"Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?"
Job,36,23,"Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?"
Job,36,24,"Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold."
Job,36,25,Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
Job,36,26,"Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out."
Job,36,27,For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapor of it.
Job,36,28,Which the clouds do drop and distill upon man abundantly.
Job,36,29,"Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?"
Job,36,30,"Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea."
Job,36,31,For by them he judgeth the people; he giveth food in abundance.
Job,36,32,With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the intervening cloud.
Job,36,33,"The noise of it showeth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapor."
Job,37,1,"At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place."
Job,37,2,"Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth."
Job,37,3,"He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning to the ends of the earth."
Job,37,4,After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellence; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
Job,37,5,"God thundereth marvelously with his voice; great things he doeth, which we cannot comprehend."
Job,37,6,"For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength."
Job,37,7,He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
Job,37,8,"Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places."
Job,37,9,From the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold from the north.
Job,37,10,By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
Job,37,11,Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:
Job,37,12,And it is turned around by his counsels: that they may do whatever he commandeth them upon the face of the world on the earth.
Job,37,13,"He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy."
Job,37,14,"Hearken to this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God."
Job,37,15,"Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?"
Job,37,16,"Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?"
Job,37,17,"How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?"
Job,37,18,"Hast thou with him spread out the sky which is strong, and as a molten looking-glass?"
Job,37,19,Teach us what we shall say to him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
Job,37,20,"Shall it be told him that I speak? If a man shall speak, surely he will be swallowed up."
Job,37,21,"And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them."
Job,37,22,Fair weather cometh from the north: with God is terrible majesty.
Job,37,23,"Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in abundance of justice: he will not afflict."
Job,37,24,Men therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
Job,38,1,"Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,"
Job,38,2,Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
Job,38,3,"Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me."
Job,38,4,"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding."
Job,38,5,"Who hath laid the measures of it, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?"
Job,38,6,Upon what are the foundations of it fastened? or who laid its corner stone;
Job,38,7,"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
Job,38,8,"Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?"
Job,38,9,"When I made a cloud its garment, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it,"
Job,38,10,"And broke up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,"
Job,38,11,"And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed."
Job,38,12,Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the day-spring to know its place;
Job,38,13,"That it might take hold of the ends of earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?"
Job,38,14,It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.
Job,38,15,"And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the high arm shall be broken."
Job,38,16,Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
Job,38,17,Have the gates of death been opened to thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shades of death?

Jeremiah,26,19,"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear the LORD, and beseech the LORD, and the LORD repented of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls. The Prophet Uriah"

Jeremiah,27,19,"For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea,"
Jeremiah,27,20,"Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim"
Jeremiah,27,21,"Yes, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD,"
Jeremiah,27,22,"They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place."
Jeremiah,28,1,"And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests, and of all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,28,2,"Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of"
Jeremiah,28,3,"Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD’S house,"
Jeremiah,28,4,"And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,5,"Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the"
Jeremiah,28,6,"Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD’S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place."
Jeremiah,28,7,"Nevertheless, now hear thou this word that I speak in thy ears, and in the ears of all the people:"
Jeremiah,28,8,"The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries,"
Jeremiah,28,9,"The prophet who prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him."
Jeremiah,28,10,"Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it."
Jeremiah,28,11,"And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way."
Jeremiah,28,12,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from"
Jeremiah,28,13,"Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD;"
Jeremiah,28,14,"For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the"
Jeremiah,28,15,"Then said the prophet Jeremiah to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now,"
Jeremiah,28,16,"Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD."
Jeremiah,28,17,So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah,29,1,"Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders who were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon; 2(After Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters,"

Jeremiah,29,22,"And concerning them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;"
Jeremiah,29,23,"Because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbor’s wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD. The Message to Shemaiah"
Jeremiah,29,24,"Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,"

Jeremiah,29,28,"For therefore he sent to us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them."
Jeremiah,29,29,And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,29,30,Then came the word
Jeremiah,29,31,"Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because Shemaiah hath prophesied to you, and I sent him not,"
Jeremiah,29,32,"Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD."
Jeremiah,30,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,30,2,"Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel,"
Jeremiah,30,3,"For lo, the days come, saith the LORD; that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it."
Jeremiah,30,4,And these are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
Jeremiah,30,5,"For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,"Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?"
Jeremiah,30,7,"Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble, but he shall be saved out of it."
Jeremiah,30,8,"For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy"
Jeremiah,30,9,"But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them."
Jeremiah,30,10,"Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and quiet, and none shall make him afraid."
Jeremiah,30,11,"For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished."
Jeremiah,30,12,"For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous."
Jeremiah,30,13,"There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines."
Jeremiah,30,14,"All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisements of a cruel one, for the multitude of thy iniquity; because thy sins were increased."
Jeremiah,30,15,"Why criest thou for thy affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thy iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things to thee."
Jeremiah,30,16,"Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thy adversaries, every one of them shall go into captivity; and they that plunder thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey."
Jeremiah,30,17,"For I will restore health to thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after."
Jeremiah,30,18,"Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places; and the city shall be built upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after its manner."

Jeremiah,31,9,"They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born."
Jeremiah,31,10,"Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock."
Jeremiah,31,11,"For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he."
Jeremiah,31,12,"Therefore they shall come and sing in the hight of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all."
Jeremiah,31,13,"Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow."
Jeremiah,31,14,"And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,15,"Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not."
Jeremiah,31,16,"Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thy eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy."
Jeremiah,31,17,"And there is hope in thy end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border."
Jeremiah,31,18,"I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God."
Jeremiah,31,19,"Surely after I was turned, I repented; and after I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, and even confounded, because I bore the reproach of my youth."
Jeremiah,31,20,"Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,21,"Set thee up way-marks, make thee high heaps: set thy heart towards the highway, even the way which thou wentest; turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities."
Jeremiah,31,22,"How long wilt thou wander about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man."

Ezekiel,19,4,"The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,19,5,"Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion."
Ezekiel,19,6,"And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men."

Ezekiel,19,12,"But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them."
Ezekiel,19,13,"And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground."
Ezekiel,19,14,"And fire hath gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a scepter to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation."

Ezekiel,46,23,"And there was a row of building around in them, around them four, and it was made with boiling"
Ezekiel,46,24,"Then said he to me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people."

Ezekiel,47,10,"And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from En-gedi even to En-eglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds,"
Ezekiel,47,11,But its miry places and its marshes shall not be healed;
Ezekiel,47,12,"And by the river upon its bank, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall its fruit be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to its months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and its fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for medicine. The Borders of the Land"
Ezekiel,47,13,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, by which ye shall inherit the land according to"
Ezekiel,47,14,"And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land shall fall to you for inheritance."

Ezekiel,47,18,"And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border to the east sea. And this is the east side."
Ezekiel,47,19,"And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward."
Ezekiel,47,20,"The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man cometh over against Hamath. This is the west side."
Ezekiel,47,21,So shall ye divide this land to you according to the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel,47,22,"And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be to you as born in the country among the children of"

Daniel,1,1,In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to
Daniel,1,2,"And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god."
Daniel,1,3,"And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children"

Daniel,1,6,"Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and"
Daniel,1,7,"To whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave to Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed- nego. Daniel’s Faithfulness"
Daniel,1,8,"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s food, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might"

Daniel,1,12,Prove thy

Daniel,1,14,"So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days."
Daniel,1,15,And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children who ate the portion of the
Daniel,1,16,"Thus Melzar took away the portion of their food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse. Daniel’s Wisdom"
Daniel,1,17,"As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams."
Daniel,1,18,"Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the"
Daniel,1,19,"And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore they stood before the"
Daniel,1,20,"And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them"
Daniel,1,21,And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.
Daniel,2,1,"And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which"
Daniel,2,2,"Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to show the king his dream. So they came"
Daniel,2,3,"And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream."
Daniel,2,4,"Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Syriac, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and"
Daniel,2,5,"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known to me the dream, with the interpretation of it, ye shall be cut in pieces,"
Daniel,2,6,"But if ye shall show the dream, and the interpretation of it, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream, and the"
Daniel,2,7,"They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we"
Daniel,2,8,"The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain"
Daniel,2,9,"But if ye will not make known to me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the"
Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king’s matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that hath asked such"
Daniel,2,11,"And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."
Daniel,2,12,"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of"
Daniel,2,13,And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. The Dream Revealed to Daniel
Daniel,2,14,"Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who had"
Daniel,2,15,"He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why"
Daniel,2,16,"Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his"
Daniel,2,18,That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel,2,19,Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel,2,20,"Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:"
Daniel,2,21,"And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:"
Daniel,2,22,"He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him."
Daniel,2,23,"I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known to me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known to us the king’s matter. Daniel Interprets the Dream"
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went into Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus to him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him, I have found a man of"
Daniel,2,26,"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known to me the dream which I"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded, the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the sooth-sayers,"
Daniel,2,28,"But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon"
Daniel,2,29,"As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass."
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart."
Daniel,2,31,"Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent,"
Daniel,2,32,"The head of this image was of fine gold, his breast and"
Daniel,2,33,"His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of"
Daniel,2,34,"Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that"
Daniel,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.
Daniel,2,37,"Thou, O king, art a king"
Daniel,2,38,"And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth."
Daniel,2,40,And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth
Daniel,2,41,"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter’s clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay."
Daniel,2,42,"And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong,"
Daniel,2,43,"And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay."
Daniel,2,44,"And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume"
Daniel,2,45,"Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain, without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it sure. Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel"
Daniel,2,46,"Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they"
Daniel,2,47,"The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldst"
Daniel,2,48,"Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of"
Daniel,2,49,"Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king."
Daniel,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose hight was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it"
Daniel,3,2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to convene the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sherifs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image"
Daniel,3,3,"Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sherifs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were assembled to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image"
Daniel,3,4,"Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,"
Daniel,3,5,"That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that"
Daniel,3,6,And whoever shall not fall down and worship shall the same
Daniel,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Accused"
Daniel,3,8,"Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews."
Daniel,3,9,They spoke and said to
Daniel,3,10,"Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of"
Daniel,3,11,"And whoever shall not fall down and worship,"
Daniel,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."
Daniel,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego."
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do ye not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which"
Daniel,3,15,"Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not"
Daniel,3,17,"If it is so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from"
Daniel,3,18,"But if not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. The Fiery Furnace"
Daniel,3,19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace"
Daniel,3,20,"And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery"
Daniel,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their coats, their hose, and their hats, and their other"
Daniel,3,22,"Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men that"
Daniel,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said to his counselors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the"
Daniel,3,25,"He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire,"
Daniel,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spoke, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and"
Daniel,3,27,"And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counselors, being assembled, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell of fire passed upon them."
Daniel,3,28,"Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall"
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,4,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be"
Daniel,4,2,I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought towards me.
Daniel,4,3,"How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation. Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream of a Great Tree"
Daniel,4,4,"I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:"
Daniel,4,5,I saw a dream which made
Daniel,4,6,"Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the"
Daniel,4,7,"Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the sooth-sayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation"
Daniel,4,8,"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name"
Daniel,4,9,"O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation of it."
Daniel,4,10,"Thus were the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its hight was great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree grew, and was strong, and its hight reached to heaven, and the sight of it to the end of all the earth:"
Daniel,4,12,"Its leaves were fair, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shade under it, and the fowls of heaven dwelt among its boughs, and all flesh was fed from it."
Daniel,4,13,"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven;"
Daniel,4,14,"He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts escape from under it, and the fowls from its branches."
Daniel,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth."
Daniel,4,16,"Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him."
Daniel,4,17,"This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men."
Daniel,4,18,"This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation of it, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. Daniel Interprets the Second Dream"
Daniel,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation of it, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered, and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation"
Daniel,4,20,"The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose hight reached"

Daniel,4,22,"It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy"
Daniel,4,23,"And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts"
Daniel,4,24,"This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the"
Daniel,4,25,"That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou shalt"
Daniel,4,26,"And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure to thee,"
Daniel,4,27,"Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thy iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity. The Second Dream Fulfilled"
Daniel,4,28,All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,4,29,At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace

Daniel,5,24,Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.

Daniel,6,24,"And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den. Darius Honors God"
Daniel,6,25,"Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you."
Daniel,6,26,"I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even to the end."
Daniel,6,27,"He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions."

Daniel,7,7,"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and"
Daniel,7,8,"I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. Daniel’s Vision of the Ancient of Days"
Daniel,7,9,"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire."
Daniel,7,10,"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set and the books were opened."

Daniel,7,15,"I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me."
Daniel,7,16,"I came near to one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and"
Daniel,7,17,"These great beasts, which are four, are four kings,"
Daniel,7,18,"But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever."
Daniel,7,19,"Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and"

Daniel,7,27,"And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him."
Daniel,7,28,"Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart."
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after"

Daniel,8,3,"Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came"
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great."
Daniel,8,5,"And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and"
Daniel,8,6,"And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran to him in the fury of his power."
Daniel,8,7,"And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his"
Daniel,8,8,"Therefore the he-goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and in its stead came up four notable ones towards the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceeding great, towards the south,"
Daniel,8,10,"And it grew great, even to the host of heaven;"
Daniel,8,11,"Yes, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and"
Daniel,8,12,"And a host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practiced, and prospered."

Daniel,8,20,The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.
Daniel,8,21,And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
Daniel,8,22,"Now that being broken, whereas four stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power."
Daniel,8,23,"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up."
Daniel,8,24,"And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practice, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people."
Daniel,8,25,"And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand."
Daniel,8,26,And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.
Daniel,8,27,"And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it."

Daniel,11,25,And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast

Daniel,11,28,"Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land."
Daniel,11,29,"At the time appointed he shall return, and come towards the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter."
Daniel,11,30,"For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with"
Daniel,11,31,"And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that"
Daniel,11,32,And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but
Daniel,11,33,"And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil,"
Daniel,11,34,"Now when they shall fall, they shall be assisted with a little help: but many shall cleave"
Daniel,11,35,"And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed. The King Who Exalts Himself"
Daniel,11,36,"And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the"
Daniel,11,37,"Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above"
Daniel,11,38,But in his estate shall he honor the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he
Daniel,11,39,"Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain."
Daniel,11,40,"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he"
Daniel,11,41,"He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and"
Daniel,11,42,He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries:
Daniel,11,43,"But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Cushites shall be at his steps."
Daniel,11,44,But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with
Daniel,11,45,"And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain: yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him."
Daniel,12,1,"And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book."
Daniel,12,2,"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some"
Daniel,12,3,And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the
Daniel,12,4,"But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."

Daniel,12,7,"And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that liveth for ever, that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be"

Daniel,12,12,"Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand"
Daniel,12,13,"But go thou thy way till the end: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days."
Hosea,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel."
Hosea,1,2,"The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go take to thee a wife addicted to lewdness and children of lewdness; for the land hath committed great lewdness,"
Hosea,1,3,"So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; who conceived, and"
Hosea,1,4,"And the LORD said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house"
Hosea,1,5,"And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel."
Hosea,1,6,"And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And God said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for"
Hosea,1,7,"But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen."
Hosea,1,8,"Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son."
Hosea,1,9,"Then said God, Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God."
Hosea,1,10,"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said to them, Ye are the sons of the living God."
Hosea,1,11,"Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be assembled, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up from the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel."
Hosea,2,1,"Say ye to your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah."
Hosea,2,2,"Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her prostitutions out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;"
Hosea,2,3,"Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst."
Hosea,2,4,And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they are the children of lewdness.
Hosea,2,5,"For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink."
Hosea,2,6,"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths."
Hosea,2,7,"And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now."
Hosea,2,8,"For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in its time, and my wine in its season, and I will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness."
Hosea,2,10,"And now will I disclose her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand."
Hosea,2,11,"I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts."
Hosea,2,12,"And I will destroy her vines and her fig-trees, of which she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them."
Hosea,2,13,"And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, in which she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her ear-rings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith the LORD. God’s Mercy to Israel"
Hosea,2,14,"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her."
Hosea,2,15,"And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came from the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali."
Hosea,2,17,"For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name."
Hosea,2,18,"And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping animals of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down in safety."
Hosea,2,19,"And I will betroth thee to me for ever; yes, I will betroth thee to me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies."
Hosea,2,20,I will even betroth thee to me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.
Hosea,2,21,"And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;"
Hosea,2,22,"And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel."
Hosea,2,23,"And I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them who were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God."
Hosea,3,1,"Then said the LORD to me, Go yet, love a woman beloved by her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD towards the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of"
Hosea,3,2,"So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a homer of barley, and a half homer"
Hosea,3,3,"And I said to her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and"
Hosea,3,4,"For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and"
Hosea,3,5,"Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land."
Hosea,4,2,"By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood."
Hosea,4,3,"Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yes, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away."
Hosea,4,4,"Yet let no man contend, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that contend with the priest."
Hosea,4,5,"Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother."
Hosea,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children."
Hosea,4,7,"As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame."
Hosea,4,8,"They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity."
Hosea,4,9,"And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings."
Hosea,4,10,"For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall be guilty of lewdness, and shall not increase: because they have ceased to take heed to the LORD."
Hosea,4,11,Lewdness and wine and new wine take away the heart.
Hosea,4,12,"My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth to them: for the spirit of lewdness hath caused them to err, and they have gone astray from under their God."
Hosea,4,13,"They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shade of them is agreeable: therefore your daughters shall be guilty of lewdness, and your spouses shall commit adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they are guilty of lewdness, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for they themselves are separated with prostitutes, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall."
Hosea,4,15,"Though thou, Israel, playest the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye to Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth."
Hosea,4,16,For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.
Hosea,4,18,"Their drink is sour: they have been guilty of lewd deeds continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye."
Hosea,4,19,"The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices."
Hosea,5,1,"Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is towards you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor."
Hosea,5,2,"And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all."
Hosea,5,3,"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou art guilty of lewdness, and Israel is defiled."
Hosea,5,4,"They will not frame their doings to turn to their God: for the spirit of lewdness is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD."
Hosea,5,5,And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.
Hosea,5,6,They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.
Hosea,5,7,They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.
Hosea,5,8,"Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin."
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment."
Hosea,5,12,"Therefore will I be to Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness."
Hosea,5,13,"When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then Ephraim went to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet he could not heal you, nor cure you of your wound."
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him."
Hosea,5,15,"I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early."
Hosea,6,1,"Come, and let us return to the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up."
Hosea,6,2,"After two days will he revive us: in the third day will he raise us up, and we shall live in his sight."
Hosea,6,3,"Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he will come to us as the rain, as the latter and former rain to the earth."
Hosea,6,4,"O Ephraim, what shall I do to thee? O Judah, what shall I do to thee? for your goodness is as the morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away."
Hosea,6,5,Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.
Hosea,6,6,"For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice: and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings."
Hosea,6,7,But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
Hosea,6,8,"Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood."
Hosea,6,9,"And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness."
Hosea,6,10,"I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the prostitution of Ephraim, Israel is defiled."
Hosea,6,11,"Also, O Judah, he hath set a harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people."
Hosea,7,1,"When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was disclosed, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers strippeth without."
Hosea,7,2,And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them around; they are before my face.
Hosea,7,3,"They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies."
Hosea,7,4,"They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it is leavened."
Hosea,7,5,In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
Hosea,7,6,"For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire."
Hosea,7,7,"They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth to me."
Hosea,7,8,"Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned."
Hosea,7,9,"Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yes, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not."
Hosea,7,10,"And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this."
Hosea,7,11,"Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria."
Hosea,7,12,"When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard."
Hosea,7,13,"Woe to them! for they have fled from me: destruction to them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me."
Hosea,7,14,"And they have not cried to me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me."
Hosea,7,15,"Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me."
Hosea,7,16,"They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt."
Hosea,8,1,"Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law."
Hosea,8,2,"Israel shall cry to me, My God, we know thee."
Hosea,8,3,Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,"They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made for themselves idols, that they may be cut off."
Hosea,8,5,"Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; my anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocence?"
Hosea,8,6,For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
Hosea,8,7,"For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if it shall yield, the strangers shall swallow it up."
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel in which is no pleasure.
Hosea,8,9,"For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers."
Hosea,8,10,"Yes, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes."
Hosea,8,11,"Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be to him to sin."
Hosea,8,12,"I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing."
Hosea,8,13,"They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of my offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof."
Hosea,9,1,"Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast apostatized from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every corn-floor."
Hosea,9,2,"The floor and the wine-press shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her."
Hosea,9,3,"They shall not dwell in the LORD’S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria."
Hosea,9,4,"They shall not offer wine-offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing to him: their sacrifices shall be to them as the bread of mourners; all that eat of it shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD."
Hosea,9,5,"What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?"
Hosea,9,6,"For lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles."
Hosea,9,7,"The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thy iniquity, and the great hatred."
Hosea,9,8,"The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God."
Hosea,9,9,"They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins."
Hosea,9,10,"I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig-tree at her first time: but they went to Baal-peor, and separated themselves to that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved."
Hosea,9,11,"As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception."
Hosea,9,12,"Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yes, woe also to them when I depart from them!"
Hosea,9,13,"Ephraim, as I saw Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer."
Hosea,9,14,"Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts."
Hosea,9,15,"All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters."
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yes, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb."
Hosea,9,17,"My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken to him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations."
Hosea,10,1,"Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit to himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath multiplied the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images."
Hosea,10,2,"Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images."
Hosea,10,3,"For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?"
Hosea,10,4,"They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field."
Hosea,10,5,"The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven: for its people shall mourn over it, and its priests that rejoiced on it, for its glory, because it is departed from it."
Hosea,10,6,"It shall also be carried to Assyria, for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel."
Hosea,10,7,"As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water."
Hosea,10,8,"The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us."
Hosea,10,9,"O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them."
Hosea,10,10,"It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows."
Hosea,10,11,"And Ephraim is as a heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods."
Hosea,10,12,"Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he shall come and reign righteousness upon you."
Hosea,10,13,"Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou hast trusted in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men."
Hosea,10,14,"Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be plundered, as Shalman plundered Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children."
Hosea,10,15,So shall Beth-el do to you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.
Hosea,11,1,"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt."
Hosea,11,2,"As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed to Baalim, and burned incense to graven images."
Hosea,11,3,"I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them."
Hosea,11,4,"I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid food for them."
Hosea,11,5,"He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return."
Hosea,11,6,"And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels."
Hosea,11,7,"And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him. God’s Love for Israel"
Hosea,11,8,"How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? my heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together."
Hosea,11,9,"I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city."
Hosea,11,10,"They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west."
Hosea,11,11,"They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD."

Jonah,2,2,"And said, I cried by reason of my affliction to the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardst my voice."
Jonah,2,3,"For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods encompassed me: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me."
Jonah,2,4,"Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again towards thy holy temple."
Jonah,2,5,"The waters encompassed me, even to the soul: the depth inclosed me on every side, the weeds were wrapped about my head."

Jonah,3,7,"And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:"
Jonah,3,8,"But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily to God: yes, let them turn every"
Jonah,3,9,"Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?"
Jonah,3,10,"And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do to them; and he did it not."
Jonah,4,1,"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry."
Jonah,4,2,"And he prayed to the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before to Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness,"
Jonah,4,3,"Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is"

Micah,1,4,"And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place."
Micah,1,5,"For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?"

Micah,1,10,"Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust."
Micah,1,11,"Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame exposed: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive from you his standing."
Micah,1,12,For the inhabitant of Maroth waited anxiously for good: but evil came down from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem.
Micah,1,13,"O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee."

Micah,2,7,"O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?"
Micah,2,8,Even of late my people hath risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse to war.
Micah,2,9,The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.
Micah,2,10,"Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a grievous destruction."

Micah,3,7,"Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yes, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God."
Micah,3,8,"But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin."
Micah,3,9,"Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity."
Micah,3,10,"They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity."
Micah,3,11,"Her heads judge for reward, and her priests teach for hire, and her prophets divine for money; yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? no evil can come upon us."

Micah,4,3,"And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."
Micah,4,4,But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it.
Micah,4,5,"For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever. The Restoration of Zion (Zechariah 8:1–23)"
Micah,4,6,"In that day, saith the LORD, I will assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;"
Micah,4,7,"And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever."
Micah,4,8,"And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, to thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come, to the daughter of Jerusalem."
Micah,4,9,Now why dost thou cry aloud? is there no king in thee? hath thy counselor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.
Micah,4,10,"Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth from the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thy enemies."

Zephaniah,2,12,"Ye Cushites also, ye shall be slain by my sword."
Zephaniah,2,13,"And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a wilderness."
Zephaniah,2,14,"And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the threshholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work."
Zephaniah,2,15,"This is the rejoicing city that dwelt in security, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!"
Zephaniah,3,2,She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.
Zephaniah,3,3,Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.
Zephaniah,3,4,"Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law."
Zephaniah,3,5,"The just LORD is in the midst of her; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame. Purification of the Nations"
Zephaniah,3,6,"I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is no inhabitant."
Zephaniah,3,7,"I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, however I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings."
Zephaniah,3,8,"Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them my indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. A Faithful Remnant"
Zephaniah,3,9,"For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent."
Zephaniah,3,10,"From beyond the rivers of Cush my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering."
Zephaniah,3,11,"In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, in which thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain."
Zephaniah,3,12,"I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD."
Zephaniah,3,13,"The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid. Israel’s Restoration"
Zephaniah,3,14,"Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem."
Zephaniah,3,15,"The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thy enemy: the King of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more."
Zephaniah,3,16,"In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thy hands be slack."
Zephaniah,3,17,"The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing."
Zephaniah,3,18,"I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden."
Zephaniah,3,19,"Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame."
Zephaniah,3,20,"At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD."

Zechariah,1,11,"And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest."
Zechariah,1,12,"Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years."
Zechariah,1,13,And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comforting words.
Zechariah,1,14,"So the angel that communed with me said to me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am"
Zechariah,1,15,"And I am very greatly displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction."

Zechariah,1,18,"Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns."
Zechariah,1,19,"And I said to the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel,"
Zechariah,1,20,And the LORD showed me four carpenters.
Zechariah,1,21,"Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head: but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it."

Zechariah,4,5,"Then the angel that talked with me answered and said to me, Knowest thou not what these"
Zechariah,4,6,"Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts."
Zechariah,4,7,"Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth its head-stone with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace, to it."

Zechariah,5,2,"And he said to me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; its length is twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits."
Zechariah,5,3,"Then said he to me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut"
Zechariah,5,4,"I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with its timber and its stones.

Zechariah,7,6,"And when ye ate, and when ye drank, did ye not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?"
Zechariah,7,7,"Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and her cities around her, when men inhabited the south and the plain?"
Zechariah,7,8,"And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,"
Zechariah,7,9,"Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying,"
Zechariah,7,10,"And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against"
Zechariah,7,11,"But they refused to hearken, and withdrew the shoulder, and stopped their"
Zechariah,7,12,"Yes, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets:"
Zechariah,7,13,"Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried,"
Zechariah,7,14,"But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate."

Zechariah,8,5,And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.
Zechariah,8,6,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these

Zechariah,9,1,"The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest of it: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be towards the LORD."
Zechariah,9,2,"And Hamath also shall border by it; Tyre and Zidon, though it be very wise."
Zechariah,9,3,"And Tyre built herself a strong hold, and amassed silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets."
Zechariah,9,4,"Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire."
Zechariah,9,5,"Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited."
Zechariah,9,6,"And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines."
Zechariah,9,7,"And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite."

Zechariah,9,9,"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh to thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass."
Zechariah,9,10,"And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle-bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace to the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth."
Zechariah,9,11,"As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit in which is no water."
Zechariah,9,12,"Turn ye to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to-day do I declare that I will render double to thee;"
Zechariah,9,13,"When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man. The LORD Will Save His People"

Zechariah,9,15,"The LORD of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar."
Zechariah,9,16,"And the LORD their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land."
Zechariah,9,17,"For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids."
Zechariah,10,1,"Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD will make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field."
Zechariah,10,2,"For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled because there was no shepherd."
Zechariah,10,3,"My anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle."
Zechariah,10,4,"Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle-bow, out of him every oppressor together."
Zechariah,10,5,"And they shall be as mighty men, who tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded."
Zechariah,10,6,"And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them."
Zechariah,10,7,"And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yes, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD."
Zechariah,10,8,"I will hiss for them, and gather them: for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased."
Zechariah,10,9,"And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in remote countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again."
Zechariah,10,10,"I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them."
Zechariah,10,11,"And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart."
Zechariah,10,12,"And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD."
Zechariah,11,1,"Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars."
Zechariah,11,2,"Howl, fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are laid waste: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down."
Zechariah,11,3,There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is laid waste.
Zechariah,11,4,Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;

Zechariah,11,7,"And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took to me two staffs; the"
Zechariah,11,8,Three shepherds also I cut off
Zechariah,11,9,"Then said I, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat, every one the flesh of another. Thirty Pieces of Silver (Matthew 27:3–10)"
Zechariah,11,10,"And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had"
Zechariah,11,11,And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited

Zechariah,11,14,"Then I cut asunder my other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel."
Zechariah,11,15,"And the LORD said to me, Take to thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd."
Zechariah,11,16,"For lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who shall not visit those that are cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces."
Zechariah,11,17,"Woe to the idle shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be wholly dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened."

Zechariah,12,6,"In that day will I make the governors of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people around, on the right hand and on the left: and"
Zechariah,12,7,"The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem"

Zechariah,13,9,"And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, The LORD is my God."
Zechariah,14,1,"Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee."

John,9,24,"Then again they called the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that"

John,10,19,There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
John,10,20,"And many of them said,"
John,10,21,"Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind? Jesus at the Feast of Dedication"

John,10,32,"Jesus answered them, Many good works have"
John,10,33,"The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man,"
John,10,34,"Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?"

John,11,10,"But if a man walketh in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him."
John,11,11,"These things he said: and after that he saith to them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out"
John,11,12,"Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleepeth he will do well."
John,11,13,Now Jesus spoke of his death:
John,11,14,"Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus"
John,11,15,"And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless,"

John,11,29,"As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came to him."
John,11,30,"Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him."
John,11,31,"The Jews then who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose hastily,"
John,11,32,"Then when Mary had come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been"
John,11,33,"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled;"
John,11,34,"And said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see."
John,11,35,Jesus wept.
John,11,36,Then
John,11,37,"And some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? Jesus Raises Lazarus (Acts 9:36–43)"
John,11,38,"Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it."
John,11,39,"Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him, Lord, by"
John,11,40,"Jesus saith to her, Said I not to"

John,11,45,"Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on"
John,11,46,"But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done."
John,11,47,"Then the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and said, What do we? for this man"
John,11,48,"If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will"

John,11,51,And this he spoke not
John,11,52,"And not for that nation only, but that also he should assemble in one the children of God that were scattered"
John,11,53,Then from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death.
John,11,54,"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples."
John,11,55,And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country to Jerusalem before

Romans,1,17,"For in this is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. God’s Wrath against Sin"
Romans,1,18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men,"
Romans,1,19,"Because that which may be known of God, is manifest in"
Romans,1,20,"For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead;"
Romans,1,21,"Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."
Romans,1,22,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools:"
Romans,1,23,"And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping animals."
Romans,1,24,"Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor"
Romans,1,25,"Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen."
Romans,1,26,For this cause God gave them up to vile affections. For even their women did change the natural use
Romans,1,27,"And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one towards another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet."
Romans,1,28,"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate"
Romans,1,29,"Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,"
Romans,1,30,"Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventers of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
Romans,1,31,"Without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:"
Romans,1,32,"Who, knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit such things are worthy of death; not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."
Romans,2,1,"Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whoever thou art, that judgest: for wherein thou judgest"

Romans,2,29,"But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God."
Romans,3,1,What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
Romans,3,2,"Much every way: chiefly,"
Romans,3,3,For what if some did not believe? will their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
Romans,3,4,"By no means: verily let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy sayings, and mayest overcome when thou art judged."
Romans,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God"

Romans,3,9,"What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;"
Romans,3,10,"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"
Romans,3,11,"There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh God."
Romans,3,12,"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable: there is none that doeth good, no, not one."
Romans,3,13,Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
Romans,3,14,Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
Romans,3,15,Their feet are swift to shed blood.
Romans,3,16,Destruction and misery are in their ways:
Romans,3,17,And the way of peace have they not known.
Romans,3,18,There is no fear of God before their eyes.

Romans,3,21,"But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being testified by the law and the"
Romans,3,22,"Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all, and upon all them"
Romans,3,23,"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"
Romans,3,24,"Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ:"
Romans,3,25,"Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission"
Romans,3,26,"To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he may be just, and the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus."
Romans,3,27,Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No; but by the law of faith.
Romans,3,28,"Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law."
Romans,3,29,Is he the God
Romans,3,30,"Seeing it is one God who will justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith."
Romans,3,31,Do we then make void the law through faith? By no means: but we establish the law.

Romans,4,13,"For the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through"
Romans,4,14,"For if they who are of the law are heirs, faith is made"
Romans,4,15,"Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression."
Romans,4,16,"Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all; 17(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations) before him whom he believed, even God, who reviveth the dead, and calleth those things which are not, as though they"

Romans,4,23,Now it was not written for his

Romans,4,25,"Who was delivered for our offenses, and raised again for our justification."
Romans,5,1,"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:"
Romans,5,2,"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
Romans,5,3,"And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also; knowing that tribulation worketh patience;"
Romans,5,4,And
Romans,5,5,"And hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Spirit which is given to us. Christ’s Sacrifice for the Ungodly (John 3:1–21)"

Romans,5,7,For scarcely for a

Romans,5,11,"And not only so, but we also joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. Death in Adam, Life in Christ (Genesis 3:1–7)"
Romans,5,12,"Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon"
Romans,5,13,"For until the law, sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when"
Romans,5,14,"Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come."
Romans,5,15,"But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many are dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded to"
Romans,5,16,"And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift. For the judgment was by one to"
Romans,5,17,"For if by one man’s offense death reigned by one; much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ."
Romans,5,18,"Therefore, as by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the"
Romans,5,19,"For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."
Romans,5,20,"Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much"
Romans,5,21,"That as sin hath reigned to death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans,6,1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
Romans,6,2,By no means: how shall
Romans,6,3,"Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized"
Romans,6,4,"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk"
Romans,6,5,"For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also"
Romans,6,6,"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body"
Romans,6,7,For he that is dead is freed from sin.

Romans,6,9,"Knowing that Christ,"

Romans,6,13,"Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those"
Romans,6,14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. The Wages of Sin"
Romans,6,15,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? By no means."
Romans,6,16,"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants in obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey;"
Romans,6,17,"But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin; but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you."
Romans,6,18,"Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness."
Romans,6,19,"I speak after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity, to (work) iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness, to (work) holiness."
Romans,6,20,"For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness."
Romans,6,21,What fruit had ye then in
Romans,6,22,"But now being made free from sin, and having become servants to God, ye have your fruit to holiness, and the end"

Romans,7,1,"Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law) that the law hath dominion over a"
Romans,7,2,"For the woman who hath a husband, is bound by the law to her husband"
Romans,7,3,"So then, if while her husband liveth, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband is dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man."
Romans,7,4,"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God."
Romans,7,5,"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members"
Romans,7,6,"But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead by which we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. God’s Law Is Holy"
Romans,7,7,"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? By no means. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I"

Romans,7,13,"Was then that which is good made death to me? By no means. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."
Romans,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."
Romans,7,15,"For that which I do, I allow"
Romans,7,16,"If then I do that which I would not,"
Romans,7,17,"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
Romans,7,18,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me;"
Romans,7,19,"For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil"
Romans,7,20,"Now if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
Romans,7,21,"I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me."
Romans,7,22,For I delight in the law of

Romans,8,1,"There is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to"
Romans,8,2,"For the law of the Spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath made me"
Romans,8,3,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:"
Romans,8,4,"That the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but"
Romans,8,5,"For they that are according to the flesh, do mind the things of the flesh: but"
Romans,8,6,For to be carnally minded is death; but

Romans,8,12,"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh."
Romans,8,13,"For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall"
Romans,8,14,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
Romans,8,15,"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba,"
Romans,8,16,"The Spirit itself testifieth with our spirit, that we are the children of God:"
Romans,8,17,"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if we suffer with him, that we may be glorified together. Future Glory (2 Corinthians 5:1–10)"
Romans,8,18,"For I reckon, that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory"

Romans,8,24,For we are saved by hope: But hope
Romans,8,25,"But if we hope for what we see not, then with patience we wait for it."
Romans,8,26,Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought:
Romans,8,27,"And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints, according to the will of God. God Works in All Things (Ephesians 1:3–14)"
Romans,8,28,"And we know that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are the"
Romans,8,29,"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed"
Romans,8,30,"Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
Romans,8,31,"What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?"
Romans,8,32,"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
Romans,8,33,Who will lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth:
Romans,8,34,"Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, or rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. More than Conquerors (Psalm 44:1–26)"
Romans,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
Romans,8,36,"As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
Romans,8,37,"But in all these things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us."
Romans,8,38,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,"
Romans,8,39,"Nor hight, nor depth, nor any other creature, will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

Romans,9,12,"It was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger."
Romans,9,13,"As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated."
Romans,9,14,What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? By no means.
Romans,9,15,"For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have"
Romans,9,16,"So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth"
Romans,9,17,"For the scripture saith to Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth."
Romans,9,18,"Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth."
Romans,9,19,"Thou wilt say then to me, Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath resisted his will?"

Romans,10,2,For I bear them
Romans,10,3,"For they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves"

1 Corinthians,5,9,"I have written to you in this epistle, not to associate with persons guilty of lewdness:"
1 Corinthians,5,10,"Yet not altogether with lewd persons of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters: for"
1 Corinthians,5,11,"But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother is a lewd person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or"
1 Corinthians,5,12,For what have I to do to judge them also that are
1 Corinthians,5,13,But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
1 Corinthians,6,1,"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the"
1 Corinthians,6,2,"Do ye not know that the saints will judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you,"
1 Corinthians,6,3,Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much

1 Corinthians,6,5,"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not"
1 Corinthians,6,6,"But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers."
1 Corinthians,6,7,"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye"
1 Corinthians,6,8,"But ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. Members of Christ"
1 Corinthians,6,9,"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,"
1 Corinthians,6,10,"Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of"

1 Corinthians,6,15,"Know ye not, that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make"
1 Corinthians,6,16,What? know ye not that he who is joined to a harlot is
1 Corinthians,6,17,But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit. The Temple of the Holy Spirit (Romans 12:1–8; 1 Corinthians 3:16–23)
1 Corinthians,6,18,"Flee lewdness. Every sin that a man doeth, is without the body; but he that committeth lewdness,"
1 Corinthians,6,19,"What, know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit"
1 Corinthians,6,20,"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s."
1 Corinthians,7,1,Now concerning the things of which ye wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
1 Corinthians,7,2,"Nevertheless, to avoid lewdness, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her"
1 Corinthians,7,3,Let the husband render to the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the

1 Corinthians,7,5,"Defraud ye not one the other, except with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan may"
1 Corinthians,7,6,"But I speak this by permission, and not as a commandment."
1 Corinthians,7,7,"For I would that all men were as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that."
1 Corinthians,7,8,"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I."
1 Corinthians,7,9,"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:"
1 Corinthians,7,11,"But if she shall depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife."
1 Corinthians,7,12,"But to the rest I speak, not the Lord, if any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she is pleased"
1 Corinthians,7,13,"And the woman who hath a husband that believeth not,"
1 Corinthians,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean;"
1 Corinthians,7,15,"But if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not"

1 Corinthians,7,17,"But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so"
1 Corinthians,7,18,Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is

1 Corinthians,7,20,Let every man continue in the same calling in which he was called.
1 Corinthians,7,21,"Art thou called being a servant? care not for it; but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather."
1 Corinthians,7,22,"For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s free-man: likewise also he that is called,"
1 Corinthians,7,23,Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
1 Corinthians,7,24,"Brethren, let every man in the state in which he is called, continue in it with God. The Unmarried and Widowed"
1 Corinthians,7,25,"Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment as one that"
1 Corinthians,7,26,I suppose therefore that this is good for the present
1 Corinthians,7,27,Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed.
1 Corinthians,7,28,"But if thou marry, thou hast not sinned: and if a virgin"
1 Corinthians,7,29,"But this I say, brethren, The time is short. It remaineth, that both they that have wives, be as though they"
1 Corinthians,7,30,"And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they"
1 Corinthians,7,31,"And they that use this world, as not abusing it. For the fashion of this world passeth away."
1 Corinthians,7,32,"But I would have you without anxious care. He that is unmarried, is anxious for the things that belong"
1 Corinthians,7,33,"But he that is married, is anxious for the things that are"
1 Corinthians,7,34,"There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy, both in body and in spirit: but she that is married, is anxious for the things of the world, how she may please her husband."
1 Corinthians,7,35,"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself uncomely towards his virgin, if she hath passed the flower of her age, and need so requireth, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry."
1 Corinthians,7,37,"Nevertheless, he that standeth steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his"
1 Corinthians,7,38,So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.
1 Corinthians,7,39,"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband is dead, she is at"
1 Corinthians,7,40,"But she is happier if she so remain, after my judgment; and I think also that I have the Spirit of God."
1 Corinthians,8,1,"Now as concerning things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth"
1 Corinthians,8,2,"And if any man thinketh that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet"
1 Corinthians,8,3,"But if any man loveth God, the same is known by him."
1 Corinthians,8,4,"Therefore as concerning the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that"
1 Corinthians,8,5,For though there are that are
1 Corinthians,8,6,"Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him."
1 Corinthians,8,7,But there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it
1 Corinthians,8,8,But food commendeth us
1 Corinthians,8,9,But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours should become a stumbling-block to them that are weak.
1 Corinthians,8,10,"For if any man shall see thee, who hast knowledge, sit eating in the idol’s temple, will not the"
1 Corinthians,8,11,And
1 Corinthians,8,12,But when ye thus sin
1 Corinthians,8,13,"Wherefore, if food maketh my brother to fall into sin, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to fall into sin."
1 Corinthians,9,1,Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are ye not my work in the
1 Corinthians,9,2,"If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for ye are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,9,3,"My answer to them that examine me is this,"
1 Corinthians,9,4,Have we not power to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians,9,5,"Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and"
1 Corinthians,9,6,"Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power to forbear working?"
1 Corinthians,9,7,"Who goeth a warfare at any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of its fruit? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"
1 Corinthians,9,8,Do I say these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
1 Corinthians,9,9,"For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for"
1 Corinthians,9,10,"Or saith he this altogether for our sakes? for our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that"
1 Corinthians,9,11,If
1 Corinthians,9,12,"If others are partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power;"
1 Corinthians,9,13,"Do ye not know that they who minister about holy things live from the things of the temple, and they who wait at the altar are partakers with"
1 Corinthians,9,14,Even so hath the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should live by the gospel.
1 Corinthians,9,15,"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done"
1 Corinthians,9,16,"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of: for necessity is laid upon me; and woe is to me, if I"
1 Corinthians,9,17,"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a"
1 Corinthians,9,18,"What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my power in the gospel. Paul the Servant to All"
1 Corinthians,9,19,"For though I am free from all men, yet I have made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more."
1 Corinthians,9,20,"And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as"
1 Corinthians,9,21,"To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that"
1 Corinthians,9,22,"To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak: I have become all"
1 Corinthians,9,23,"And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I may be partaker of it with you. Run Your Race to Win"
1 Corinthians,9,24,"Know ye not, that they who run in a race, all run, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may"
1 Corinthians,9,25,And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to
1 Corinthians,9,26,"I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so I fight,"
1 Corinthians,9,27,"But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest by any means when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast-away."
1 Corinthians,10,1,"Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, that all our fathers were under the cloud,"
1 Corinthians,10,2,And were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
1 Corinthians,10,3,And all
1 Corinthians,10,4,And all drank the same spiritual drink: (for they drank of that spiritual

1 Corinthians,10,6,"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also"
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them: as it is written, The people sat down to eat"
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Neither let us commit lewdness, as some of them committed, and fell"
1 Corinthians,10,9,"Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted,"
1 Corinthians,10,10,"Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were"
1 Corinthians,10,11,Now all these things happened to them for examples: and they are
1 Corinthians,10,12,Wherefore let him that
1 Corinthians,10,13,"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. Flee from Idolatry (Exodus 20:22–26)"
1 Corinthians,10,14,"Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
1 Corinthians,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which"
1 Corinthians,10,17,"For we being many are one bread, and one"
1 Corinthians,10,18,Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they who eat
1 Corinthians,10,19,"What then do I say? that the idol is any thing, or that which"
1 Corinthians,10,20,"But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they"
1 Corinthians,10,21,"Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table,"
1 Corinthians,10,22,Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? All to God’s Glory (1 Peter 4:1–11)
1 Corinthians,10,23,"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all"

1 Corinthians,10,25,Whatever is sold in

1 Corinthians,10,27,"If any of them that believe not invites you to a feast, and ye are disposed to go;"
1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if any man shall say to you, This is offered in sacrifice to idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience’"
1 Corinthians,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not thy own, but of the other:"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"For if I by grace am a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God."
1 Corinthians,10,32,"Give no offense,"
1 Corinthians,10,33,"Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved."
1 Corinthians,11,1,"Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,2,"Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered"
1 Corinthians,11,3,"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the"
1 Corinthians,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head"
1 Corinthians,11,5,But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
1 Corinthians,11,6,"For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be"
1 Corinthians,11,7,"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of"
1 Corinthians,11,8,"For the man is not from the woman, but the woman"
1 Corinthians,11,9,"Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man."
1 Corinthians,11,10,For this
1 Corinthians,11,11,"Nevertheless, neither is"

1 Corinthians,11,17,"Now in this that I declare to you, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for"
1 Corinthians,11,18,"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions among"
1 Corinthians,11,19,"For there must be also heresies among you, that they who are approved"
1 Corinthians,11,20,"When therefore ye come together in one place, this is not to eat"
1 Corinthians,11,21,"For in eating every one taketh before another his own supper: and one is hungry,"
1 Corinthians,11,22,"What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not."
1 Corinthians,11,23,"For I have received from the Lord, that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus, the same"
1 Corinthians,11,24,"And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said,"
1 Corinthians,11,25,"After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood:"
1 Corinthians,11,26,"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord’s death till he shall come."
1 Corinthians,11,27,"Wherefore, whoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of"
1 Corinthians,11,28,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and"
1 Corinthians,11,29,"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh condemnation to"
1 Corinthians,11,30,"For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and"
1 Corinthians,11,31,"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"And if any man hungereth, let him eat at home; that ye come not together to condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant."
1 Corinthians,12,2,Ye know that ye were
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"And there are differences of administrations,"
1 Corinthians,12,6,"And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in"
1 Corinthians,12,7,But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man for profit.
1 Corinthians,12,8,For to one is given by the

1 Corinthians,12,10,"To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, divers kinds of languages;"
1 Corinthians,12,11,"But all these worketh that one and the same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. The Body of Christ"
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many,"
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am"
1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye,"
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where were"
1 Corinthians,12,18,But now hath God set the members
1 Corinthians,12,19,"And if they were all one member, where were"
1 Corinthians,12,20,"But now are they many members, yet but one body."
1 Corinthians,12,21,And the eye cannot say to the
1 Corinthians,12,22,"Nay, much"
1 Corinthians,12,23,"And those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and"
1 Corinthians,12,24,For our comely parts have no need: but God

1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, next"

1 Corinthians,12,31,But covet earnestly the best gifts. And yet I show to you a more excellent way.
1 Corinthians,13,1,"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as"
1 Corinthians,13,2,"And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have"
1 Corinthians,13,3,"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,"
1 Corinthians,13,5,"Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;"
1 Corinthians,13,6,"Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;"
1 Corinthians,13,7,"Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Charity never faileth: but whether there are prophecies, they shall fail; whether there are languages,"
1 Corinthians,13,9,"For we know in part, and we"
1 Corinthians,13,10,"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done"
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when"
1 Corinthians,13,12,For now we see through a glass darkly; but then face
1 Corinthians,13,13,"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For he that speaketh in an unknown language, speaketh not to men, but to God: for no man understandeth him; yet in the"
1 Corinthians,14,3,"But he that prophesieth, speaketh to men to edification, and exhortation,"
1 Corinthians,14,4,He that speaketh in an unknown language edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth
1 Corinthians,14,5,"I would that ye all spoke in languages, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh in languages, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in languages, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"For if the trumpet shall give an uncertain sound, who will prepare"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how"
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds"
1 Corinthians,14,11,"Therefore, if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian to"
1 Corinthians,14,12,"Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church."
1 Corinthians,14,13,"Wherefore, let him that speaketh in an unknown language, pray that he may interpret."
1 Corinthians,14,14,For if I pray
1 Corinthians,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will"
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Else, when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified."
1 Corinthians,14,18,"I thank my God,"
1 Corinthians,14,19,"Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown language."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brethren, be not children in understanding: yet in malice be ye children, but in understanding be"
1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people;"
1 Corinthians,14,22,"Wherefore languages are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not,"
1 Corinthians,14,23,"If therefore the whole church is assembled in one place, and all speak in languages, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is"
1 Corinthians,14,25,"And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, and report that God is in you in truth. Orderly Worship"
1 Corinthians,14,26,"How is it then, brethren? when ye are assembled, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine,"

In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter."
2 Corinthians,7,12,"Wherefore, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you."

2 Timothy,2,7,Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
2 Timothy,2,8,Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:
2 Timothy,2,9,"In which I suffer trouble, as an evil-doer, even to bonds; but the word of God is not bound."

Hebrews,5,6,"As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."

Hebrews,5,10,Called by God a high priest after the order of Melchisedec. Milk and Solid Food (1 Corinthians 3:1–9)
Hebrews,5,11,"Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing."
Hebrews,5,12,"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need of one to teach you again which are the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong food."
Hebrews,5,13,"For every one that useth milk, is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe."
Hebrews,5,14,"But strong food belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
Hebrews,6,1,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again"

Hebrews,6,7,"For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh often upon it, and bringeth forth herbs fit for"
Hebrews,6,8,"But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh to cursing; whose end is to be burned."
Hebrews,6,9,"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though"

Hebrews,6,11,And we desire
Hebrews,6,12,"That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. God’s Unchangeable Promise"
Hebrews,6,13,"For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by"

Hebrews,6,15,"And so, after"

Hebrews,7,1,"For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from"

Hebrews,7,3,"Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like to the Son of God; abideth a priest continually."
Hebrews,7,4,"Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the"
Hebrews,7,5,"And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, though"
Hebrews,7,6,But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes
Hebrews,7,7,And without all contradiction the less is blessed
Hebrews,7,8,"And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is testified"
Hebrews,7,9,"And as I may say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham."
Hebrews,7,10,"For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. A Superior Priesthood"

Hebrews,7,17,"For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
Hebrews,7,18,For there is verily a disannulling of the preceding commandment on account of its weakness and
Hebrews,7,19,"For the law made nothing perfect, but the introduction of a better hope did; by"
Hebrews,7,20,"And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: 21(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath, by him that said to him, The Lord swore, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)"
Hebrews,7,22,By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
Hebrews,7,23,"And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:"
Hebrews,7,24,"But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood."
Hebrews,7,25,"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"For such a high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made"
Hebrews,7,27,"Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for"
Hebrews,7,28,"For the law maketh men high priests who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such a high priest, who is set on"
Hebrews,8,2,"A minister of the sanctuary, and of the"

Hebrews,8,5,"Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished by God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See (saith he) that thou make all things according to the pattern shown to thee in the mount. The New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:26–40)"
Hebrews,8,6,"But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for the second."
Hebrews,8,8,"For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:"
Hebrews,8,9,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord."
Hebrews,8,10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:"
Hebrews,8,11,"And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest."
Hebrews,8,12,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."
Hebrews,8,13,"In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and groweth old is ready to vanish away."
Hebrews,9,1,"Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary."
Hebrews,9,2,"For there was a tabernacle made; the first, in which was the candlestick, and the table, and the show-"
Hebrews,9,3,"And after the second vail, the tabernacle which is called the"
Hebrews,9,4,"Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid around with gold, in which was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;"
Hebrews,9,5,And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
Hebrews,9,6,"Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle,"
Hebrews,9,7,"But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not"
Hebrews,9,8,"The Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while the first tabernacle was"
Hebrews,9,9,"Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and"
Hebrews,9,10,"Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. Redemption through His Blood"
Hebrews,9,11,"But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle,"
Hebrews,9,12,"Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood; he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for"
Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctify"
Hebrews,9,14,"How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
Hebrews,9,15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they who are called may receive"
Hebrews,9,16,"For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the"
Hebrews,9,17,For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength
Hebrews,9,18,Hence even the first testament was not dedicated without blood.
Hebrews,9,19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book and all the"
Hebrews,9,20,"Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined to you."
Hebrews,9,21,"Moreover, he"
Hebrews,9,22,And almost all things are by the law cleansed with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
Hebrews,9,23,It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these;
Hebrews,9,24,"For Christ hath not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to"
Hebrews,9,25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest"
Hebrews,9,26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away
Hebrews,9,27,"And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:"
Hebrews,9,28,So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him he will appear the second time without sin to salvation.
Hebrews,10,1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers to them perfect."
Hebrews,10,2,"For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshipers once cleansed, would"
Hebrews,10,3,But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of
Hebrews,10,4,For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me:"
Hebrews,10,6,In burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
Hebrews,10,7,"Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written concerning me,) to do thy will, O God."
Hebrews,10,8,"Above, when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt-offerings and offering for sin thou wouldst not,"
Hebrews,10,9,"Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will,"
Hebrews,10,10,By which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Hebrews,10,11,"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never"
Hebrews,10,12,"But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the"

Hebrews,10,15,"Of this the Holy Spirit also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,"
Hebrews,10,16,"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;"
Hebrews,10,17,And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
Hebrews,10,18,"Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. A Call to Persevere (Jude 1:17–23)"

Hebrews,10,38,"Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man shall draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."
Hebrews,10,39,But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
Hebrews,11,1,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
Hebrews,11,2,For by it the elders obtained a good report.
Hebrews,11,3,"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which appeared. The Faith of Abel, Enoch, Noah (Genesis 4–9)"
