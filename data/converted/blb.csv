John,4,31,"But in the meantime the disciples were asking Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”"
John,4,32,"But He said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know.”"
John,4,33,"Therefore the disciples were saying to one another, “No one brought Him anything to eat?”"

John,4,41,And many more believed because of His word.

John,4,43,"And after the two days, He went forth from there into Galilee."
John,4,44,For Jesus Himself
John,4,45,"Therefore when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen the greatness of all the things He had done in Jerusalem during the feast, for they themselves also had gone to the feast."
John,4,46,"Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine. And"
John,4,47,"Having heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and was asking that He would come down and heal his son; for he was about to die."
John,4,48,"Therefore Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”"
John,4,49,"The royal official says to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”"
John,4,50,"Jesus says to him, “Go, your son lives.”"
John,4,51,"And already as he is going down, his servants met him, saying that his son lives."
John,4,52,"Therefore he inquired from them the hour in which he got better. Therefore they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”"
John,4,53,"Therefore the father knew that it was in that hour at which Jesus said to him, “Your son lives.” And he himself believed, and his whole household."
John,4,54,"This is now again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee."
John,5,1,"After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
John,5,2,"Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Hebrew called Bethesda, having"
John,5,3,"In these were lying a multitude of those ailing, blind, lame, paralyzed.a"
John,5,5,"And a certain man was there, himself being thirty and eight years in infirmity."
John,5,6,"Jesus, having seen him lying and having known that he has been a long time already, says to him, “Do you desire to become well?”"
John,5,7,"The one ailing answered Him, “Sir, I do not have a man, that when the water has been stirred, he might put me into the pool; and while I am going, another descends before me.”"
John,5,8,"Jesus says to him, “Arise, take up your mat, and walk.”"
John,5,9,"And immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and began to walk."
John,5,10,"Therefore the Jews were saying to the one having been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your mat.”"
John,5,11,"But he answered them, “The One having made me well, that One said to me ‘Take up your mat and walk.’”"
John,5,12,"Therefore they asked him, “Who is the man having said to you, ‘Take it up and walk’?”"
John,5,13,"And the one having been healed did not know who it is, for Jesus had moved away, a crowd being in the place."
John,5,14,"After these things Jesus finds him in the temple and said to him, “Behold, you have"
John,5,15,The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus is the One having made him well. The Father and the Son
John,5,16,"And because of this, the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these"
John,5,17,"But Jesus answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I am working.”"
John,5,18,"Therefore because of this, the Jews were seeking the more to kill Him, because not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but also He was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal to God."
John,5,19,"Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son is able to do nothing of Himself, if not anything He may see the Father doing; for whatever"
John,5,20,"For the Father loves the Son and shows to Him all things that He does. And He will show Him greater works than these, so that you may marvel."
John,5,21,"For even as the Father raises up the dead and gives life, thus also the Son gives life to"
John,5,22,"For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, 23so that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who is not honoring the Son is not honoring the Father, the One having sent Him."
John,5,24,"Truly, truly, I say to you that the one hearing My word and believing the One having sent Me, he has eternal life and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life."

John,5,30,"I am able to do nothing of Myself. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My will, but the will of the One having sent Me. Testimonies about Jesus"
John,5,31,"If I bear witness concerning Myself, My testimony is not true."
John,5,32,"It is another bearing witness concerning Me, and I know that the testimony which he bears witness concerning Me is true."

John,5,34,"And I do not receive testimony from man, but I say these things that you may be saved."
John,5,35,"He was the lamp burning and shining, and you were willing to rejoice for a season in"
John,5,36,"But I have testimony greater than that of John. For the works that the Father has given Me that I should complete them, the same works which I do, bear witness"
John,5,37,"And the One having sent Me, the Father Himself, has borne witness concerning Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time,"
John,5,38,"And you do not have His word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He sent. The Witness of Scripture (Luke 16:19-31)"
John,5,39,"You diligently search the Scriptures because you think to have eternal life in them, and these are they bearing witness concerning Me; 40and you are not willing to come to Me, that you may have life."
John,5,41,"I do not take glory from men, 42but I have known you, that you do not have the love"

John,6,6,"Now He was saying this testing him, for He knew what He was about to do."
John,6,7,"Philip answered Him, “Two hundred denarii wortha of loaves are not sufficient for them, that each might receive one little piece.”"
John,6,8,"One of His disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, says to Him, 9“Here is a little boy who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are these for so many?”"
John,6,10,"Jesus said, “Make the men to recline.” Now there was much grass in the place; therefore the men reclined, about five thousand in number."
John,6,11,"And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, He distributed to those reclining; likewise also of the fish, as much as they wished."
John,6,12,"Now when they were filled, He says to His disciples, “Gather together the fragments"
John,6,13,"So they gathered them together and filled twelve hand-baskets of fragments from the five barley loaves, which were over and above to those having eaten."
John,6,14,"Therefore the people, having seen what sign He had done, were saying, “This is truly"

John,7,8,"You go up to the feast. I am nota going up to this feast, for My time has not yet been fulfilled.”"
John,7,9,"Now having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee."
John,7,10,"But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He also went up—not openly, but as in secret."
John,7,11,"Therefore the Jews were seeking Him at the feast, and were saying, “Where is He?”"
John,7,12,"And there was much murmuring about Him among the crowds. For some were saying, “He is good.” But others were saying, “No, but He deceives the people.”"

John,9,8,"Therefore the neighbors and those having seen him before, that he was a beggar, were saying, “Is this not he who was sitting and begging?”"
John,9,9,"Some were saying, “It is he,” but others, were saying, “No, but he is like him.” He kept saying, “I am he.”"
John,9,10,"Therefore they were saying to him, “How then were your eyes opened?”"
John,9,11,"He answered, “The man called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and He said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ Therefore having gone and having washed, I received sight.”"
John,9,12,"And they said to him, “Where is He?” He says, “I do not know.” The Pharisees Investigate the Healing"

John,9,16,"Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man is not from God, for He does not keep the Sabbath.” But others were saying, “How is a sinful man able to do such signs?”"
John,9,17,"Therefore they say again to the blind man, “What do you say concerning Him, for He opened your eyes?” And he said, “He is a prophet.”"

John,9,25,"Then he answered, “Whether He is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that being blind, now I see.”"
John,9,26,"So they said to him, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?”"
John,9,27,"He answered them, “I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you wish to hear again? Do you wish to become His disciples also?”"

John,9,35,"Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him, He said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”a"

John,9,38,"And he was saying, “I believe, Lord.” And he worshiped Him."

John,10,11,I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
John,10,12,"But the hired servant, being not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees—and the wolf snatches them and scatters them— 13because he is a hired servant and is not himself concerned about the sheep."

John,10,19,Again there was division among the Jews on account of these words.

John,10,33,"The Jews answered Him, “We do not stone You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, make yourself God.”"
John,10,34,"Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law: ‘I said you are gods’b?"
John,10,35,"If he called them gods to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture is not able to be broken, 36do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, ‘I am Son of God’?"

John,11,8,"The disciples say to Him, “Rabbi, just now the Jews were seeking to stone You, and You are going there again?”"
John,11,9,"Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he"
John,11,10,"But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”"
John,11,11,"He said these things, and after this He says to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go that I may awaken him.”"
John,11,12,"Therefore His disciples said, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.”"
John,11,13,"Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He speaks of the rest of sleep."
John,11,14,"So then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus has died, 15and I am glad for your sake I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”"

John,11,17,"Therefore having come, Jesus found him already having been four days in the tomb."

John,11,34,"And He said, “Where have you laid him.” They say to Him, “Lord, come and see.”"
John,11,35,Jesus wept.
John,11,36,"Therefore the Jews were saying, “Behold how He loved him!”"
John,11,37,"But some of them said, “Was not this man having opened the eyes of the blind able to have caused that this one also should not have died?” Jesus Raises Lazarus (Acts 20:7-12)"
John,11,38,"So Jesus, being deeply moved in Himself again, comes to the tomb. Now it was a cave,"

John,11,40,"Jesus says to her, “Did I not say to you that if you should believe, you will see the glory of God.”"
John,11,41,"So they took away the stone. Now Jesus lifted His eyes upwards and said, “Father, I"
John,11,42,"And I knew that always You hear Me; but I said it on account of the crowd standing around, that they may believe that You sent Me.”"

John,11,49,"But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest the same year, said to them, “You know nothing at all, 50nor do you consider that it is profitable for you that one man should die for the people, and the whole nation should not perish.”"
John,11,51,"Now he did not say this from himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation, 52and not for the nation only, but also that children of God, those having been scattered, He might gather together into one."
John,11,53,"So from that day, they took counsel together that they might kill Him."
John,11,54,"Therefore Jesus no longer walked publicly among the Jews, but went away from there into the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. And there He stayed with the disciples."

John,18,29,"Therefore Pilate went out to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”"
John,18,30,"They answered and said to him, “If He were not doing evil, we would not have delivered Him to you.”"
John,18,31,"Therefore Pilate said to them, “Take Him yourselves and judge Him according to your Law.” The Jews said to him, “It is not permitted to us to put anyone to death”— 32that word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He had spoken signifying what death He was about to die."
John,18,33,"Therefore Pilate entered again into the Praetorium, and he called Jesus and said to Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?”"
John,18,34,"Jesus answered, “Do you say this of yourself, or did others say it to you concerning Me?”"
John,18,35,"Pilate answered, “Am I a Jew? Your nation and the chief priests delivered You to me. What have You done?”"
John,18,36,"Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would fight that I might not be betrayed to the Jews. But now My kingdom is not from here.”"
John,18,37,"Therefore Pilate said to Him, “Then You are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I may bear witness to the truth. Everyone being of the truth hears My voice.”"

John,19,7,"The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to the law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.”"
John,19,8,"Therefore when Pilate heard this word, he was even more afraid."
John,19,9,"And he went into the Praetorium again, and he says to Jesus, “Where are You from?” But Jesus did not give him an answer."
John,19,10,"Therefore Pilate says to Him, “Do You not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You, and I have authority to crucify You?”"
John,19,11,"Jesus answered him, “You would have no authority over Me, if it were not given to you from above. Because of this, the one having delivered Me up to you has greater sin.”"
John,19,12,"Out of this, Pilate was seeking to release Him; but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar. Everyone making himself a king speaks against Caesar.”"

John,19,17,"And bearing His own cross, He went out to the place called the Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha, 18where they crucified Him, and with Him two others, on this side and on that side, and Jesus in between."
John,19,19,"And Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross. And it was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS."

John,20,11,"But Mary stood outside at the tomb weeping. Then as she was weeping, she stooped down into the tomb, 12and she sees two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain."
John,20,13,"And they say to her, “Woman, why do you weep?” She says to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.”"
John,20,14,"Having said these things, she turned back around, and she sees Jesus standing there,"
John,20,15,"Jesus says to her, “Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek?” Thinking that it is the gardener, she says to Him, “Sir, if you have carried Him off, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away.”"
John,20,16,"Jesus says to her, “Mary.” Having turned around, she says to Him in Hebrew, “Rabboni,” that is to say, “Teacher.”"
John,20,17,"Jesus says to her, “Do not touch Me, for not yet have I ascended to the Father. Now go to My brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.’”"
John,20,18,"Mary Magdalene comes bringing word to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and that He had said these things to her. Jesus Appears to the Disciples (Luke 24:36-43; 1 John 1:1-4)"

John,20,25,"So the other disciples were saying to him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hands into His side, I will never believe.”"
John,20,26,"And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them, the doors having been shut. Jesus comes, and He stood in the midst and said, “Peace to you.”"
John,20,27,"Then He says to Thomas, “Bring your finger here, and see My hands; and bring your hand, and put it into My side; and be not unbelieving, but believing.”"
John,20,28,"Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!”"
John,20,29,"Jesus says to him, “Because you have seen Me, you have believed; blessed are those not having seen, yet having believed.” The Purpose of John's Book"

John,21,1,"After these things, Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias."

John,21,3,"Simon Peter says to them, “I am going to fish.” They say to him, “We also are coming with you.” They went forth and went up into the boat, and during that night they caught nothing."

John,21,5,"Therefore Jesus says to them, “Children do you have any food?” They answered Him, “No.”"
John,21,6,"And He said to them, “Cast the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast, and they were not able to haul it in from the multitude of the fish."
John,21,7,"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved says to Peter, “It is the Lord.” So Simon Peter, having heard that it is the Lord, put on the outer garment, (for he was naked), and he"
John,21,8,"Now the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net with the fish, for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away.a"
John,21,9,"So when they got out onto the land, they see a fire of coals lying, and a fish lying on it, and bread."
John,21,10,"Jesus says to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have now caught.”"
John,21,11,"Therefore Simon Peter went up and drew the net to the land, full of large fish, a hundred fifty-three. Although there are so many, the net was not torn."
John,21,12,"Jesus says to them, “Come, have breakfast.” But none of the disciples dared to ask Him,"
John,21,13,"Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, and the fish likewise."
John,21,14,"This is now the third time Jesus was revealed the disciples, having been raised out from the dead. Jesus Reinstates Peter"
John,21,15,"Therefore when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love Me more than these?” He says to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I dearly love You.” He says to him, “Feed My lambs.”"
John,21,16,"He says to him again a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love Me?” He says to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I dearly love You.” He says to him, “Shepherd My sheep.”"
John,21,17,"He says to him the third time, “Simon son of John, do you dearly love Me?” Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, “Do you dearly love Me?” And he said to Him, “Lord, You know all things; You know that I dearly love You.” Jesus says to him, “Feed My sheep."
John,21,18,"Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you dressed yourself and walked where you desired; but when you shall be old, you will stretch forth your hands, and"
John,21,19,"Now He said this signifying by what death he will glorify God. And having said this, He says to him, “Follow Me.” Jesus and the Beloved Apostle"
John,21,20,"Having turned, Peter sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, the one who also had reclined on His bosom at the supper and said, “Lord, who is it who is betraying You?”"
John,21,21,"Therefore having seen him, Peter says to Jesus, “Lord, and what about this man?”"
John,21,22,"Jesus says to him, “If I desire him to remain until I come, what is it to you? You follow"
John,21,23,"Therefore this saying went out among the brothers, that this disciple does not die. But Jesus had not said to him that he does not die, but, “If I desire him to remain until I come, what is it to you?”"
John,21,24,"This is the disciple bearing witness concerning these things, and the one having written these things. And we know that his testimony is true."

Romans,3,28,Therefore we reckon a man to be justified by faith apart from works of the Law.
Romans,3,29,"Or is He the God of Jews only, not also of Gentiles? Yes, also of Gentiles, 30since indeed God is the One who will justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through the same faith."
Romans,3,31,"Do we, then, nullify the Law through faith? Never may it be! Instead, we uphold Law. a 4 Psalm 51:4 b 10-12 Psalms 14:1-3; 53:1-3 c 13 Psalm 5:9 d 13 Psalm 140:3 e 14 Psalm 10:7 f 15-17 Isaiah 59:7,8 g 18 Psalm 36:1"

Romans,4,5,"However, to the one not working, but believing on the One justifying the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness, 6just as David also declares the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: 7“Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; 8blessed is the man against whom the Lord will never reckon sin.”b"
Romans,4,9,"Is this blessing then on the circumcision, or also on the uncircumcision? For we are saying"
Romans,4,10,"How then was it credited? Being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision."
Romans,4,11,"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith that he had while in the uncircumcision, for him to be father of all those believing while in uncircumcision, for the righteousness to be credited also to them, 12and the father of circumcision to those not only of circumcision, but also to those walking in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham during uncircumcision.

Romans,4,16,"Therefore it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, for the promise to be sure to all the seed, not only to that of the Law, but also to that of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us of all— 17as it has been written: “I have made you a father of many nations.”c—before God whom he believed, the One giving life to the dead and calling into being the things not even existing, 18who against hope, in hope believed, for him to become the father of many nations, according to that having been spoken, “So shall your"

Romans,4,22,Therefore also “it was credited to him unto righteousness.”e
Romans,4,23,"Now it was not written on account of him alone that “it was credited to him,” 24but also on account of us, to whom it is about to be credited, to those believing on the One having raised Jesus our Lord out from the dead, 25who was delivered over for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification. a 3 Genesis 15:6 b 7-8 Psalm 32:1,2 c 17 Genesis 17:5 d 18 Genesis 15:5 e 22 Genesis 15:6"

Romans,7,14,"For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, having been sold under sin."
Romans,7,15,"For what I do, I do not understand. For what I want, this I do not do; but what I hate,"

Romans,8,22,For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails together until now.
Romans,8,23,"And not only so, but we ourselves, even having the firstfruit of the Spirit, also groan ourselves in ourselves, awaiting divine adoption as sons, the redemption of our body."

1 Corinthians,15,3,"For I delivered to you in the foremost what also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day according to the Scriptures, 5and that He appeared to Cephas,a then to the Twelve."

1 Corinthians,15,15,"Then also we are found false witnesses of God, because we have witnessed concerning God that He raised up Christ, whom He has not raised if then the dead are not raised."

1 Corinthians,15,42,So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in decay; it is raised in immortality.
1 Corinthians,15,43,It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.

Ephesians,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the One having blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms, 4just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world for us to be holy and blameless before Him, in love 5having predestined us for divine adoption as sons to Himself through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will, 6to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He has freely given us in the Beloved One, 7in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of trespasses, according to the riches of His grace 8which He lavished upon us in all wisdom and understanding, 9having made known to us the mystery of His will according to His pleasure, which He purposed in Him 10for the administration of the fullness of the times, to bring together all things in Christ—the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth— 11in Him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of the One working all things according to the counsel of His will 12for us, the ones having first trusted in Christ, to be to the praise of His glory, 13in whom you also, having heard the word of truth, the gospel your of salvation, in whom also having believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 14who is the guarantee of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory. Spiritual Wisdom"
Ephesians,1,15,"Because of this, I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus among you, and the love toward all the saints, 16do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention in my prayers, 17that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, 18the eyes your of heart being enlightened, in order for you to know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, 19and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us believing according to the working of the power of His might, 20which He worked in Christ, having raised Him out from the dead, and having set Him at His right hand in the heavenly realms, 21above every principality and authority and power and dominion, and every name being named, not only in this age, but also in the one coming."

Ephesians,2,4,"But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5made us alive with Christ even we being dead in trespasses—by grace you are saved— 6and He raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 7in order that in the coming ages He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus."

Ephesians,2,11,"Therefore remember that formerly you—the Gentiles in the flesh, the ones being called the uncircumcision by that being called the circumcision, made by hands in the flesh— 12that at that time you were separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, not having hope and without God"
Ephesians,2,13,"But now in Christ Jesus you, the ones once being far off, have become near by the blood of Christ."
Ephesians,2,14,"For He Himself is our peace, having made both one and having broken down the barrier of the partition of hostility, 15having annulled in His flesh the law of commandments in ordinances, so that He might create in Himself the two into one new man, making peace, 16and He might reconcile both to God in one body through the cross, by it having slain the hostility."

Ephesians,2,19,"So then, you are no longer strangers and aliens, but are fellow citizens of the saints and of the household of God, 20having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, 21in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is increasing into a holy temple in the Lord, 22in whom you also are being built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit."
Ephesians,3,1,"For reason of this, I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles..."
Ephesians,3,2,"Surely you have heard of the administration of God’s grace, having been given to me toward you, 3that He made known to me the mystery by revelation, just as I have written before in brief, 4which, by reading, you are able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 5which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as now it has been revealed in the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets, 6that the Gentiles are joint-heirs, and a joint-body, and joint-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus, through the gospel, 7of which I became servant according to the gift of God’s grace, having been given to me according to the working of His power."
Ephesians,3,8,"To me, the very least of all saints, was given this grace: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ 9and to enlighten all what is the administration of the mystery having been hidden from the ages in God, the One having created all things, 10so that now through the church the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, 11according to the purpose of the ages, which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord, 12in whom we have boldness and access in confidence, by faith in Him."
Ephesians,3,13,"Therefore I implore you not to lose heart at my tribulations for you, which is your glory. Paul's Prayer for the Ephesians 14... for reason of this I bow my knees to the Father,a 15from whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named, 16that He might give you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power by His Spirit in the inner man, 17for Christ to dwell in your hearts through faith, being rooted and being founded in love, 18so that you may be fully able, with all the saints, to comprehend what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 19and to know the love of Christ surpassing knowledge, so that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God."

New Life in Christ"
Ephesians,4,17,"This therefore I say and testify in the Lord: You are no longer to walk as also the Gentiles are walking, in the futility of their mind, 18being darkened in the understanding, being alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance being in them on account of the hardness of their heart, 19who, having cast off all feeling, have given themselves up to sensuality for the working of all impurity, with greediness for more."
Ephesians,4,20,"But you have not learned Christ this way, 21if indeed you have heard Him and have"
Ephesians,4,22,"You are to have put off, concerning the former way of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to its desires of deceit, 23and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 24and to have put on the new man, having been created according to God in righteousness and holiness of truth."
Ephesians,4,25,"Therefore having put off falsehood, let each one speak truth with his neighbor, because we are members of one another. 26“Be angry, and yet do not sin.”c Let not the sun set upon your anger, 27neither give opportunity to the devil."
Ephesians,4,28,"The one stealing, let him steal no longer, but rather let him toil, working with the own hands what is good, so that he may have something to impart to the one having need."

Ephesians,5,17,"Because of this, do not be foolish, but understand what is the Lord’s will, 18and not to be drunk with wine in which is debauchery. Instead be filled with the Spirit, 19speaking to each other in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, 20giving thanks at all times for all things in the name our Lord Jesus Christ to the God and Father. Wives and Husbands (Song of Solomon 1:1-3; 1 Peter 3:1-7)"
Ephesians,5,21,"Be submitting yourselves to one another in reverence of Christ: 22wives, to the own husbands as to the Lord; 23for the husband is head of the wife as also Christ is the head"
Ephesians,5,24,"But even as the church is subjected to Christ, so also wives to the own husbands in everything."
Ephesians,5,25,"Husbands, love the wives just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, 26so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water by the word, 27so that He might present to Himself the church in glory, not having spot or wrinkle or any of the such things, but that it would be holy and blameless."

Ephesians,6,5,"Slaves, obey the earthly masters with fear and trembling, in sincerity of your heart as to Christ, 6not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, 7rendering service with good will as to the Lord and not to men, 8knowing that each one, whatever good he might have done, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is slave or free."
Ephesians,6,9,"And masters do the same things toward them, giving up threatening, knowing that also their master and yours is in the heavens, and there is no partiality with Him. The Armor of God"

Paul's Trials Advance the Gospel (James 1:2-8)"
Philippians,1,12,"Now I want you to know brothers, that the things concerning me really have turned out to the advancement of the gospel, 13so as for my chains in Christ to have become clearly known in all the palace guarda and to all the rest; 14and most of the brothers, trusting in the Lord by my chains, to dare more abundantly to speak fearlessly the word.b"
Philippians,1,15,"For some, even from envy and strife, are proclaiming Christ, but some also from goodwill— 16the ones indeed out of love, knowing that I am appointed for defense of the gospel; 17but the others are proclaiming Christ out of selfish ambition, not purely, supposing to add tribulation to my chains."
Philippians,1,18,"What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretext or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. And in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, 19for I know that through your prayer and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, this will turn out for me to deliverance, 20according to my earnest expectation and hope that I will be ashamed in nothing, but in all boldness also now as always, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.

Philippians,1,27,"Only conduct yourselves worthily of the gospel of Christ, so that, whether having come and having seen you, or being absent, I might hear the things concerning you, that you are standing firm in one spirit, striving together with one mind for the faith of the gospel, 28and not being frightened in anything by those opposing you, which is a demonstration"

Shining as Stars (Matthew 5:13-16)"

Philippians,3,1,"Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you indeed is not troublesome to me, and is safe for you."
Philippians,3,2,Beware of the dogs! Beware of the evil workers! Beware of the false circumcision!
Philippians,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, those worshiping in the Spirit of God, and glorying in Christ Jesus, and not trusting in the flesh— 4though I have confidence even in the flesh. If any other thinks to trust in the flesh, I more: 5circumcision on the eighth day; of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin; a Hebrew of Hebrews; according to the Law, a Pharisee; 6according to zeal, persecuting the church; according to righteousness in the Law, having become faultless. Knowing Christ Above All Else"
Philippians,3,7,"But whatever things were gain to me, these I have esteemed loss because of Christ."
Philippians,3,8,"But indeed, therefore, I also count all things to be loss because of the excelling knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, because of whom I have lost all things, and esteem them rubbish, that I may gain Christ 9and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is through faith from Christ, the righteousness of God on the basis of faith, 10to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, 11if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from out of dead.

Philippians,3,18,"For many are walking—of whom I have told you often and now I say even weeping—as enemies of the cross of Christ, 19whose end is destruction, whose God is the belly and glory is in their shame, those minding earthly things."
Philippians,3,20,"For our citizenship exists in the heavens, from whence also we are awaiting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21who will transform our body of humiliation, conformed to the body of His glory, according to the working enabling Him even to subdue all things to Himself."
Philippians,4,1,"Therefore my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, beloved."
Philippians,4,2,I exhort Euodia and I exhort Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.

Colossians,2,20,"If you have died with Christ, away from the principles of the world, why as if living in the world do you submit to decrees: 21“You should not handle! You should not taste!

1 Timothy,5,9,"Let a widow be enrolled, being not less than sixty years old, the wife of one man, 10being borne witness to in good works: if she has brought up children, if she has entertained strangers, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has imparted relief to those being oppressed, if she has followed after every good work."

Hebrews,1,1,"God, having spoken long ago to our fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, 2in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom He made the ages, 3who, being the radiance of His glory and the exact expression of His substance, and upholding all things by the power of His word, through having made the purification of sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 4having become by so much superior to the angels, as much as He has inherited a name more excellent beyond theirs."
Hebrews,1,5,"For to which of the angels did He ever say: “You are my Son; today I have begotten You”a? And again: “I will be to Him for a Father, and He will be to Me for a Son”b?"

Hebrews,5,1,"For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed on behalf of men in things relating to God, that he should offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins, 2being able to exercise forbearance with those being ignorant and going astray, since he himself also is encompassed by weakness; 3and because of this, he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins, so also for himself, just as for the people."

Hebrews,6,13,"For God, having made His promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater to swear by, swore by Himself, 14saying, “Surely if blessing, I will bless you; and multiplying, I will"
Hebrews,6,15,"And thus having waited patiently, he obtained the promise."
Hebrews,6,16,"For men swear by one greater, and an end of all their disputes, for confirmation, is the oath, 17in which God, desiring to show more abundantly the unchangeableness of His purpose to the heirs of the promise, guaranteed it by an oath, 18so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have strong encouragement, having fled for refuge, to take hold of the hope being set before us, 19which we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and unshakable and entering into that within the veil, 20where Jesus, the forerunner for us, has entered, having become a high priest to the age, according to the order of Melchizedek. a 1 Or from pointless rituals b 2 Or cleansing rites c 14 Genesis 22:17"

Hebrews,7,12,"For of the priesthood being changed, from necessity a change of Law also takes place."
Hebrews,7,13,"For he concerning whom these things are said belonged to another tribe, from which"
Hebrews,7,14,"For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, a tribe as to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests."
Hebrews,7,15,"And it is yet more abundantly evident if another priest according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises, 16who has been constituted not according to a law of a fleshly"

Hebrews,8,1,"Now the point of the things being spoken of is that we have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, 2a minister in the holy places and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, not man."
Hebrews,8,3,For every high priest is appointed in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices; wherefore it

Hebrews,8,10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord, putting My Laws into their mind, and I will inscribe them upon their hearts; and I will be to them God, and they will be to Me for a people."
Hebrews,8,11,"And they shall not teach, each his neighbor, and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ because all will know Me, from the least of them to the greatest, 12because I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I shall remember their sins no more.b"

Hebrews,9,2,"For a tabernacle was prepared, the first room in which were both the lampstand and the table,"
Hebrews,9,3,"Now behind the second veil was a tabernacle, being called the Holy of Holies, 4having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant, having been covered around in every part with gold, in which was the golden pot having the manna, and the staff of Aaron having budded, and the"

Hebrews,9,8,"By this the Holy Spirit was signifying that the way into the holy places has not yet been made manifest, the first tabernacle still having a standing, 9which is a symbol for the present time, in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, not being able to make perfect in regard to conscience the one worshiping, 10consisting only in foods and drinks and various washings—ordinances of the flesh being imposed until the time of reformation. Redemption through His Blood"
Hebrews,9,11,"But Christ, having appeared as high priest of the good things having come,a by the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made by hands, that is, not of this creation, 12nor by blood of goats and calves, but through the own blood, He entered once for all into the holy places, having obtained eternal redemption."
Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and of bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those having been defiled sanctify them for the purification of the flesh, 14how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself unblemished to God, purify ourb conscience from dead works, in order to serve the living God!"
Hebrews,9,15,"And because of this, He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those having been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance."
Hebrews,9,16,"For where there is a will, it is necessary to establish the death of the one having made"
Hebrews,9,17,"For a will is affirmed after death, since it is not in force at the time when the one having made it is living, 18wherefore neither has the first been inaugurated apart from"
Hebrews,9,19,"For of every commandment having been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, having taken the blood of calves and of goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, 20saying, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God commanded unto you.”c"

Hebrews,9,24,"For Christ has entered not into holy places made by hands, copies of the true ones, but into heaven itself, now to appear for us in the presence of God, 25nor that He should offer Himself repeatedly, just as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with the blood of another."
Hebrews,9,26,Otherwise it was necessary for Him to have suffered repeatedly from the foundation of the world. But now He has been revealed once in the consummation of the ages for the putting away of sin by the sacrifice of Himself.
Hebrews,9,27,"And inasmuch as it is apportioned to men to die once, and after this, judgment, 28so also Christ, having been offered once in order to bear the sins of many, will appear for a second time, apart from sin, to those awaiting Him for salvation. a 11 BYZ and TR that are to come b 14 BYZ and TR your c 20 Exodus 24:8"

1 Peter,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the One according to His great mercy having begotten us again to a living hope, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ out from the dead, 4to an inheritance imperishable and undefiled and unfading, being reserved in the heavens for you, 5who are being guarded by the power of God through faith, for the salvation ready to be revealed in the last time, 6in which you greatly rejoice, at present for a little while if it is being necessary, having been put to grief by various trials, 7so that the proven genuineness of your faith, more precious than gold, perishing though being refined by fire, may be discovered to result in praise and glory and honor in the revelation of Jesus Christ, 8whom not having seen you love, on whom now believing though not seeing you also exult with joy inexpressible and filled with glory, 9receiving the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls."
1 Peter,1,10,"Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought out and searched out diligently, having prophesied of the grace toward you, 11inquiring into what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them was signifying, testifying beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glories after these, 12to whom it was revealed that they were serving not themselves, but you, in those things which now have been proclaimed to you by those having proclaimed the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit having been sent from heaven, into which angels desire to look. A Call to Holiness (Hebrews 12:14-17)"
1 Peter,1,13,"Therefore having girded up the loins of your mind, being sober-minded, set your hope fully upon the grace being brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ, 14as children"

1 Peter,1,17,"And if you call on as Father the One judging impartially according to the work of each, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your sojourn, 18knowing that you were redeemed from your futile manner of life handed down from your fathers, not by perishable things—by silver or by gold— 19but by the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, 20having been foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but having been revealed in the last times for the sake of you, 21who by Him believe in God, the one having raised Him up out from the dead and having given Him glory, so as for your faith and hope to be in God. The Word of the Lord Stands (Isaiah 40:6-8)"
1 Peter,1,22,"Having purified your souls in obedience to the truth unto sincere brotherly love, love one another fervently, out of a pure heart,b 23having been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, by the living and abiding word of God, 24because, “All flesh is like grass, and all the glory of it like the flower of grass.

The Living Stone (Isaiah 28:14-22; 1 Corinthians 3:10-15)"
1 Peter,2,4,"Coming to Him, a living stone, indeed rejected by men, but chosen and precious in the sight of God, 5you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,2,6,"Therefore it is contained in Scripture: “Behold, I lay in Zion a stone, a chosen precious cornerstone; and the one believing on Him, shall not be put to shame.”a"
1 Peter,2,7,"Therefore the preciousness is to you believing. But to those disobeying, “The stone which those building have rejected, this has become into the head of the corner,”b 8and, “A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.”c They stumble at being disobedient to the word, to which also they were appointed."

1 Peter,2,11,"Beloved, I exhort you as aliens and sojourners, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against the soul, 12keeping your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that wherein which they speak against you as evildoers, through having witnessed the good deeds, they may glorify God in the day of visitation. Submission to Authorities (Romans 13:1-7)"
1 Peter,2,13,"Be in subjection to every human institution for the sake of the Lord, whether to the king as being supreme, 14or to governors as being sent by him for vengeance to evildoers and praise to well doers, 15because the will of God is this: doing good, to put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, 16as free, and not having the freedom as a cover-up for evil, but as servants of God."

1 Peter,3,17,"For it is better to suffer for doing good, if the will of God wills it, than doing evil, 18because Christ also sufferedd once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, so that He might bring you to God, having been put to death indeed in the flesh, but having been made alive in the spirit, 19in which also having gone, He preached to the spirits in prison 20at one time having disobeyed, when the longsuffering of God was waiting in the days of Noah, of the ark being prepared, in which a few—that is, eight souls—were saved through water, 21which also prefigures the baptism now saving you, not a putting away of the filth of flesh, but the demand of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers having been subjected to Him. a 10-12 Psalm 34:12-16 b 14 Or fear what they fear c 14 Isaiah 8:12 d 18 NE and WH died"

Therefore be clear minded and be sober for the purpose of prayers, 8above all things, having fervent love among yourselves, because love covers over a multitude of sins, 9hospitable to one another without complaint, 10as each has received a gift, to them serving each other as good stewards of the manifold grace of God: 11if anyone speaks, as oracles of God; if anyone serves, as of strength which God supplies, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the power to the ages of the ages.
