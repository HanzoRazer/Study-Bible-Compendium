1 Samuel,2,16,"And [if] any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and [then] take [as much] as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, [Nay]; but thou shalt give [it me] now: and"
1 Samuel,2,17,Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
1 Samuel,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before the LORD, [being] a child, girded with a linen ephod."
1 Samuel,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought [it] to him from year to year, when she came up with her"
1 Samuel,2,20,"And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home."
1 Samuel,2,21,"And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD."
1 Samuel,2,22,"Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women"
1 Samuel,2,23,"And he said unto them, Why do"
1 Samuel,2,24,"Nay, my sons; for [it is] no good"
1 Samuel,2,25,"If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them."
1 Samuel,2,26,"And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men. A Prophecy against the House of Eli"
1 Samuel,2,27,"And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear"
1 Samuel,2,28,"And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel [to be] my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of"
1 Samuel,2,29,"Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded [in my] habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the"
1 Samuel,2,30,"Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed [that] thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed."
1 Samuel,2,31,"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there"
1 Samuel,2,32,"And thou shalt see an enemy [in my] habitation, in all [the"

1 Samuel,2,34,"And this [shall be] a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day"
1 Samuel,2,35,"And I will raise me up a faithful priest, [that] shall do according to [that] which [is] in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before"
1 Samuel,2,36,"And it shall come to pass, [that] every one that is left in thine house shall come [and] crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread."
1 Samuel,3,1,And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; [there was] no open vision.
1 Samuel,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli [was] laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax"
1 Samuel,3,3,"And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the"

1 Samuel,3,8,"And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called"
1 Samuel,3,9,"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
1 Samuel,3,10,"And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel"
1 Samuel,3,11,"And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in"
1 Samuel,3,12,"In that day I will perform against Eli all [things] which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an"
1 Samuel,3,13,For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth;
1 Samuel,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. Samuel Shares the Vision"
1 Samuel,3,15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel"
1 Samuel,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered,"
1 Samuel,3,17,"And he said, What [is] the thing that [the LORD] hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide [it] not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide [any] thing from me of all the things"
1 Samuel,3,18,"And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It [is] the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good."
1 Samuel,3,19,"And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground."
1 Samuel,3,20,And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel [was] established [to be] a prophet of
1 Samuel,3,21,And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
1 Samuel,4,1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and"
1 Samuel,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they"
1 Samuel,4,3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it"
1 Samuel,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth [between] the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, [were] there with the ark of the covenant of God."
1 Samuel,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great"
1 Samuel,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What [meaneth] the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that"
1 Samuel,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore."
1 Samuel,4,8,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these [are] the Gods that

1 Samuel,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there"
1 Samuel,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain. The Death of Eli"
1 Samuel,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes"
1 Samuel,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told"
1 Samuel,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What [meaneth] the"
1 Samuel,4,15,Now Eli was ninety and eight years
1 Samuel,4,16,"And the man said unto Eli, I [am] he that came"

1 Samuel,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years."
1 Samuel,4,19,"And his daughter in law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, [near] to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she"
1 Samuel,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not,"
1 Samuel,4,21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from"
1 Samuel,4,22,"And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken."
1 Samuel,5,1,"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod."

1 Samuel,5,6,"But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them"
1 Samuel,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that [it was] so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and"

1 Samuel,5,12,And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1 Samuel,6,1,And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
1 Samuel,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we"

1 Samuel,6,4,"Then said they, What [shall be] the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, [according to] the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague [was] on you all, and on your lords."
1 Samuel,6,5,"Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from"

1 Samuel,6,13,And [they of] Bethshemesh [were] reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their

1 Samuel,6,21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, [and] fetch it up to you."
1 Samuel,7,1,"And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house"
1 Samuel,7,2,"And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,3,"And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, [then] put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts"
1 Samuel,7,4,"Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only."
1 Samuel,7,5,"And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,6,"And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured [it] out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh."
1 Samuel,7,7,"And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard [it], they were afraid of"

1 Samuel,7,11,"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until [they came] under Bethcar."
1 Samuel,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone, and set [it] between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer,"
1 Samuel,7,13,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel."
1 Samuel,7,14,"And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
1 Samuel,7,15,And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1 Samuel,7,16,"And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel,"
1 Samuel,7,17,And his return [was] to Ramah; for there [was] his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.

1 Samuel,8,9,"Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. Samuel’s Warning"
1 Samuel,8,10,And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.
1 Samuel,8,11,"And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint [them]"
1 Samuel,8,12,"And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and [will set them] to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots."
1 Samuel,8,13,"And he will take your daughters [to be] confectionaries, and [to be] cooks, and [to be] bakers."
1 Samuel,8,14,"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, [even] the best [of them], and give"

And [Samuel] said, Behold that which is left! set [it] before thee, [and] eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day."
1 Samuel,9,25,"And when they were come down from the high place into the city, [Samuel] communed with Saul"
1 Samuel,9,26,"And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. 27[And] as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God."

1 Samuel,10,20,"And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken."
1 Samuel,10,21,"When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found."

1 Samuel,10,24,"And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that [there is] none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king."
1 Samuel,10,25,"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote [it] in a book, and laid [it] up"

1 Samuel,11,6,And the Spirit of God came upon Saul
1 Samuel,11,7,"And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent [them] throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen."
1 Samuel,11,8,"And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah"
1 Samuel,11,9,"And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by [that time] the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came"

Saul Confirmed as King"
1 Samuel,11,12,"And the people said unto Samuel, Who [is] he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men,"
1 Samuel,11,13,"And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel."
1 Samuel,11,14,"Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there."
1 Samuel,11,15,And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
1 Samuel,12,1,"And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me,"

1 Samuel,12,18,So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
1 Samuel,12,19,"And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not:"

1 Samuel,14,14,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, [which] a yoke [of oxen might plow]."
1 Samuel,14,15,"And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling."

1 Samuel,14,46,Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place. Saul’s Victories
1 Samuel,14,47,"So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against"
1 Samuel,14,48,"And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them."
1 Samuel,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters"
1 Samuel,14,50,"And the name of Saul’s wife [was] Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host [was]"
1 Samuel,14,51,And Kish [was] the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner [was] the son of Abiel.
1 Samuel,14,52,"And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him."
1 Samuel,15,1,"Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee [to be] king over his people, over Israel:"
1 Samuel,15,2,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember [that] which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid [wait] for him in the way, when he came"

1 Samuel,15,10,"Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,"
1 Samuel,15,11,"It repenteth me that I have set up Saul [to be] king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments."

1 Samuel,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,22,"And Samuel said, Hath the LORD [as great] delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey [is] better than sacrifice, [and] to hearken than the fat of rams."
1 Samuel,15,23,"For rebellion [is as] the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness [is as] iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from [being] king. Saul’s Confession"
1 Samuel,15,24,"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD,"
1 Samuel,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee,"
1 Samuel,15,26,"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected"
1 Samuel,15,27,"And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt"

1 Samuel,15,31,So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
1 Samuel,15,32,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him"
1 Samuel,15,33,"And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,34,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel,15,35,And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
1 Samuel,16,1,"And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I"
1 Samuel,16,2,"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear [it], he will kill"
1 Samuel,16,3,"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me [him]"
1 Samuel,16,4,"And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And"
1 Samuel,16,5,"And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice."
1 Samuel,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD’S"

1 Samuel,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he [was] ruddy, [and] withal of a beautiful countenance, and"
1 Samuel,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. David Serves Saul"
1 Samuel,16,14,"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him."
1 Samuel,16,15,And
1 Samuel,16,16,"Let our lord now command thy servants, [which are] before thee, to seek out a man, [who is] a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his"

1 Samuel,16,19,Wherefore Saul sent
1 Samuel,16,20,"And Jesse took an ass [laden] with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent [them] by David his son unto Saul."

1 Samuel,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."
1 Samuel,17,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh,"
1 Samuel,17,2,"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in"

1 Samuel,17,11,"When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. David Accepts the Challenge"
1 Samuel,17,12,"Now David [was] the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name [was] Jesse; and he"

1 Kings,3,6,"And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as [it is] this day."
1 Kings,3,7,"And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I [am"

1 Kings,3,9,"Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?"
1 Kings,3,10,"And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing."
1 Kings,3,11,"And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern"
1 Kings,3,12,"Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise"
1 Kings,3,13,"And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour:"
1 Kings,3,14,"And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days."
1 Kings,3,15,"And Solomon awoke; and, behold, [it was] a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. Solomon Judges Wisely"
1 Kings,3,16,"Then came there two women, [that were] harlots, unto the king, and stood before him."

1 Kings,3,19,And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
1 Kings,3,20,"And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and"
1 Kings,3,21,"And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear."
1 Kings,3,22,"And the other woman said, Nay; but the living [is] my son, and the dead [is] thy son. And this said, No; but the dead [is] thy son, and the living [is] my son. Thus they spake before the king."
1 Kings,3,23,"Then said the king, The one saith, This [is] my son that liveth, and thy son [is] the dead: and the"

1 Kings,3,27,"Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she [is] the mother thereof."
1 Kings,3,28,"And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God [was] in him, to do judgment."
1 Kings,4,1,So king Solomon was king over all Israel.

1 Kings,4,20,"Judah and Israel [were] many, as the sand which [is] by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry."
1 Kings,4,21,"And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life."
1 Kings,4,22,"And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of"
1 Kings,4,23,"Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and"
1 Kings,4,24,"For he had dominion over all [the region] on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all"
1 Kings,4,25,"And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his"

1 Kings,4,28,"Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where [the officers] were, every man according to his charge. Solomon’s Wisdom"
1 Kings,4,29,"And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even"
1 Kings,4,30,And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
1 Kings,4,31,"For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round"
1 Kings,4,32,And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.

1 Kings,4,34,"And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom."
1 Kings,5,1,And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him
1 Kings,5,2,"And Solomon sent to Hiram,"
1 Kings,5,3,"Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of"

1 Kings,5,6,Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that [there is] not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians. Hiram’s Reply to Solomon (2 Chronicles 2:11–18)
1 Kings,5,7,"And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said,"

1 Kings,5,10,So Hiram gave Solomon cedar
1 Kings,5,11,"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat [for] food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram"
1 Kings,5,12,"And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together. Solomon’s Labor Force"
1 Kings,5,13,And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
1 Kings,5,14,"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, [and] two"

1 Kings,5,17,"And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones,"
1 Kings,5,18,"And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew [them], and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house."
1 Kings,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which [is] the"
1 Kings,6,2,"And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof [was] threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty [cubits],"
1 Kings,6,3,"And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits [was] the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; [and] ten cubits [was] the breadth"
1 Kings,6,4,And for the house he made windows of narrow lights. The Chambers
1 Kings,6,5,"And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, [against] the walls of the house"
1 Kings,6,6,"The nethermost chamber [was] five cubits broad, and the middle [was] six cubits broad, and the third [was] seven cubits broad: for without [in the wall] of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that [the beams] should not be fastened in the walls of the house."
1 Kings,6,7,"And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe [nor] any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building."
1 Kings,6,8,The door for the middle chamber [was] in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding

1 Kings,6,11,"And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 12[Concerning] this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments"
1 Kings,6,13,"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel. The Temple’s Interior (2 Chronicles 3:5–9)"
1 Kings,6,14,"So Solomon built the house, and finished it."
1 Kings,6,15,"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: [and] he covered [them] on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the"
1 Kings,6,16,"And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built [them] for it within, [even] for the oracle, [even] for the most"
1 Kings,6,17,"And the house, that [is], the temple before it, was forty cubits [long]."
1 Kings,6,18,And the cedar of the house within [was] carved with knops and open flowers: all [was] cedar; there was no stone
1 Kings,6,19,"And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the"
1 Kings,6,20,"And the oracle in the forepart [was] twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and [so] covered the altar"
1 Kings,6,21,So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition
1 Kings,6,22,"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that [was] by the oracle he overlaid with gold. The Cherubim (2 Chronicles 3:10–13)"
1 Kings,6,23,"And within the oracle he made two cherubims [of] olive tree, [each] ten cubits high."
1 Kings,6,24,"And five cubits [was] the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost"
1 Kings,6,25,And the other cherub
1 Kings,6,26,The height of the one
1 Kings,6,27,"And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the [one] wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one"
1 Kings,6,28,And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
1 Kings,6,29,And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm
1 Kings,6,30,"And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. The Doors"
1 Kings,6,31,And for the entering of the oracle he made doors [of] olive tree: the lintel [and] side posts [were] a

1 Kings,6,33,"So also made he for the door of the temple posts [of] olive tree, a fourth part [of the wall]."
1 Kings,6,34,"And the two doors [were of] fir tree: the two leaves of the one door [were] folding, and the two leaves of"
1 Kings,6,35,And he carved [thereon] cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered [them] with gold fitted upon the carved work. The Courtyard
1 Kings,6,36,"And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams."
1 Kings,6,37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:"
1 Kings,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which [is] the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it."
1 Kings,7,1,"But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house."

1 Kings,22,53,"For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done."
2 Kings,1,1,Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.

2 Kings,1,3,"But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, [Is it] not because [there is] not a God in Israel, [that] ye go to inquire of Baalzebub"
2 Kings,1,4,"Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed."
2 Kings,1,5,"And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?"
2 Kings,1,6,"And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, [Is it] not because [there is] not a God in Israel, [that] thou sendest to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come"

2 Kings,1,9,"Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down."
2 Kings,1,10,"And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I [be] a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."

Jehoram Succeeds Ahaziah"
2 Kings,1,17,So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
2 Kings,1,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"

2 Kings,3,1,Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of
2 Kings,3,2,"And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made."
2 Kings,3,3,"Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom."

2 Kings,3,8,"And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom."

Nehemiah,4,20,"In what place [therefore] ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us."
Nehemiah,4,21,So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the

Nehemiah,4,23,"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, [saving that] every one put them off for washing."
Nehemiah,5,1,And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
Nehemiah,5,2,"For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, [are] many: therefore we take up corn [for them], that we may eat, and live. 3[Some] also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards,"
Nehemiah,5,4,"There were also that said, We have"
Nehemiah,5,5,"Yet now our flesh [is] as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and [some] of our daughters are brought unto bondage [already]: neither [is it] in our power [to redeem them]; for other men have our lands and vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,6,And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
Nehemiah,5,7,"Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And"
Nehemiah,5,8,"And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they"
Nehemiah,5,9,"Also I said, It [is] not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen"
Nehemiah,5,10,"I likewise, [and] my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn:"
Nehemiah,5,11,"Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth [part] of the money, and of the corn,"
Nehemiah,5,12,"Then said they, We will restore [them], and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that"
Nehemiah,5,13,"Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise. Nehemiah’s Generosity"

Nehemiah,6,15,"So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty and two days."

Nehemiah,8,9,"And Nehemiah, which [is] the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day [is] holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep."
Nehemiah,8,10,"Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for"

Nehemiah,8,17,"And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness."
Nehemiah,8,18,"Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day [was] a solemn assembly, according unto the manner."

Nehemiah,9,4,"Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, [and] Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, [and] Pethahiah, said, Stand up [and] bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise."
Nehemiah,9,6,"Thou, [even] thou, [art] LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all [things] that [are] therein, the seas, and all that [is] therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee."
Nehemiah,9,7,"Thou [art] the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;"
Nehemiah,9,8,"And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give [it, I say], to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou [art] righteous:"
Nehemiah,9,9,"And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;"
Nehemiah,9,10,"And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as [it is] this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go."
Nehemiah,9,13,"Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:"
Nehemiah,9,14,"And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:"
Nehemiah,9,15,"And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them."
Nehemiah,9,16,"But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,"
Nehemiah,9,17,"And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou [art] a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not."
Nehemiah,9,18,"Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This [is] thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;"
Nehemiah,9,19,"Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go."
Nehemiah,9,20,"Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah,9,21,"Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, [so that] they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not."
Nehemiah,9,22,"Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess [it]."
Nehemiah,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would."
Nehemiah,9,25,"And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations."
Nehemiah,9,27,"Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest [them] from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest [them] from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;"
Nehemiah,9,29,"And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."
Nehemiah,9,30,"Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands."
Nehemiah,9,31,"Nevertheless for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou [art] a gracious and merciful God."
Nehemiah,9,32,"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"Howbeit thou [art] just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:"
Nehemiah,9,34,"Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works."
Nehemiah,9,36,"Behold, we [are] servants this day, and [for] the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we [are] servants in it:"
Nehemiah,9,37,"And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we [are] in great distress."
Nehemiah,9,38,"And because of all this we make a sure [covenant], and write [it]; and our princes, Levites, [and] priests, seal [unto it]."

Esther,1,15,"What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law,"
Esther,1,16,"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that [are] in all the provinces of the king"
Esther,1,17,"For [this] deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not. 18[Likewise] shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king’s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus [shall there"

Esther,1,20,"And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small."
Esther,1,21,And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
Esther,1,22,"For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that [it] should be published according to the language of every people."
Esther,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and"
Esther,2,2,Then said the king’s servants that ministered
Esther,2,3,"And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper of"
Esther,2,4,"And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so. Esther Finds Favor 5[Now] in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name [was] Mordecai, the son of Jair,"

Esther,2,7,"And he brought up Hadassah, that [is], Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid [was] fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter."
Esther,2,8,"So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought"
Esther,2,9,"And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, [which were] meet to be given her, out of the king’s"

Esther,2,12,"Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, [to wit], six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with"
Esther,2,13,Then thus came [every] maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s

Esther,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them"
Esther,2,16,"So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which [is] the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. Esther Becomes Queen"
Esther,2,17,"And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of"
Esther,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, [even] Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king."
Esther,2,19,"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate."
Esther,2,20,"Esther had not [yet] shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him. Mordecai Uncovers a Conspiracy"
Esther,2,21,"In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus."
Esther,2,22,"And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told [it] unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the"
Esther,2,23,"And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king."
Esther,3,1,"After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and"
Esther,3,2,"And all the king’s servants, that [were] in the king’s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded"
Esther,3,3,"Then the king’s servants, which"
Esther,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he [was] a Jew."
Esther,3,5,"And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath."
Esther,3,6,"And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that [were] throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, [even] the people of Mordecai."
Esther,3,7,"In the first month, that [is], the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that [is], the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month],"

Esther,3,11,"And the king said unto Haman, The silver [is] given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee."
Esther,3,12,"Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that [were] over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and [to] every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and"
Esther,3,13,"And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, [even] upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which [is] the month Adar, and [to take] the"

Esther,4,2,And came even
Esther,4,3,"And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, [there was] great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,"So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told [it] her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he"
Esther,4,5,"Then called Esther for Hatach, [one] of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it [was], and"

Esther,4,12,And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
Esther,4,13,"Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the"
Esther,4,14,"For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, [then] shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for [such] a time as this?"
Esther,4,15,"Then Esther bade [them] return Mordecai [this answer],"
Esther,4,16,"Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which [is] not according to the law:"
Esther,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."
Esther,5,1,"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on [her] royal [apparel], and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the"
Esther,5,2,"And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, [that] she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden"
Esther,5,3,"Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what [is] thy request? it shall be even given thee"
Esther,5,4,"And Esther answered, If [it seem] good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him."
Esther,5,5,"Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and"
Esther,5,6,"And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What [is] thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what [is] thy request? even to the"
Esther,5,7,"Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request"
Esther,5,8,"If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said. Haman’s Plot against Mordecai"
Esther,5,9,"Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai."
Esther,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends,"
Esther,5,11,"And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all [the things] wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the"
Esther,5,12,"Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto"
Esther,5,13,"Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at"
Esther,5,14,"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made."
Esther,6,1,"On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the"
Esther,6,2,"And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand"
Esther,6,3,"And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for"
Esther,6,4,"And the king said, Who [is] in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to"
Esther,6,5,And the king’s
Esther,6,6,"So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than"
Esther,6,7,"And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,"
Esther,6,8,"Let the royal apparel be brought which the king [useth] to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and"
Esther,6,9,"And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man [withal] whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour."
Esther,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, [and] take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast"
Esther,6,11,"Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour."
Esther,6,12,"And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having"
Esther,6,13,"And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every [thing] that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai [be] of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him."
Esther,6,14,"And while they [were] yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
Esther,7,2,"And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What [is] thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted"
Esther,7,3,"Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the"
Esther,7,4,"For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king’s damage."
Esther,7,5,"Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that"
Esther,7,6,"And Esther said, The adversary and enemy [is] this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. The Hanging of Haman"
Esther,7,7,And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath [went] into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined
Esther,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther [was]. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered"
Esther,7,9,"And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in"
Esther,7,10,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.
Esther,8,1,On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen.
Esther,8,2,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
Esther,8,3,"And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews."
Esther,8,4,"Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,"
Esther,8,5,"And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing [seem] right before the king, and I [be] pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which [are] in all the king’s"
Esther,8,6,For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred? The Decree of Xerxes
Esther,8,7,"Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name, and seal [it] with the king’s ring: for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse."
Esther,8,9,"Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third month, that [is], the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth [day] thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which [are] from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and"
Esther,8,10,"And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’ name, and sealed [it] with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, [and] riders on mules, camels, [and] young"
Esther,8,11,"Wherein the king granted the Jews which [were] in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, [both] little ones and women, and [to take] the spoil of"
Esther,8,12,"Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, [namely], upon the thirteenth"
Esther,8,13,"The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province [was] published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. 14[So] the posts that rode upon mules [and] camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace."
Esther,8,15,"And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and"
Esther,8,16,"The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour."
Esther,8,17,"And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them."
Esther,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, that [is], the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had"
Esther,9,2,"The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could"
Esther,9,3,"And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai"
Esther,9,4,"For Mordecai [was] great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all"
Esther,9,5,"Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto"
Esther,9,6,And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
Esther,9,7,"And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,"
Esther,9,8,"And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,"
Esther,9,9,And
Esther,9,10,"The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand. Haman’s Sons Hanged"
Esther,9,11,On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
Esther,9,12,"And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what [is] thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what [is] thy request further?"
Esther,9,13,"Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which [are] in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged"
Esther,9,14,And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan;
Esther,9,15,"For the Jews that [were] in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand."
Esther,9,16,"But the other Jews that [were] in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they"
Esther,9,17,"On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. The Feast of Purim Instituted"
Esther,9,18,"But the Jews that [were] at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth [day] thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth [day] of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting"
Esther,9,19,"Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar [a day of] gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another."
Esther,9,20,"And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that [were] in all the provinces"
Esther,9,21,"To stablish [this] among them, that they should keep the"
Esther,9,22,"As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor."
Esther,9,23,"And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;"
Esther,9,24,"Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews"
Esther,9,25,"But when [Esther] came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the"
Esther,9,26,"Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and [of that] which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto"
Esther,9,27,"The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their"
Esther,9,28,"And [that] these days [should be] remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and [that] these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed."
Esther,9,29,"Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to"
Esther,9,30,"And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty"
Esther,9,31,"To confirm these days of Purim in their times [appointed], according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings"
Esther,9,32,And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
Esther,10,1,"And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and [upon] the isles of the sea."
Esther,10,2,"And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?"
Esther,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew [was] next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed."
Job,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name [was] Job; and that man was perfect and upright,"

Job,1,5,"And it was so, when the days of [their] feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings [according] to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. Satan’s First Attack"
Job,1,6,"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan"
Job,1,7,"And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered"
Job,1,8,"And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth,"

Job,1,19,"And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
Job,1,20,"Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,"
Job,1,21,"And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."
Job,1,22,"In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly."
Job,2,1,"Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan"
Job,2,2,"And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth,"
Job,2,3,"And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy"
Job,2,4,"And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath"
Job,2,5,"But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will"

Job,2,7,"So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of"
Job,2,8,And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.
Job,2,9,"Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die."
Job,2,10,"But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. Job’s Three Friends"
Job,2,11,"Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for"
Job,2,12,"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent"
Job,2,13,"So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that [his] grief was very great."
Job,3,1,"After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day."
Job,3,2,"And Job spake, and said,"
Job,3,3,"Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night [in which] it was said, There is a man child conceived."
Job,3,4,"Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it."
Job,3,5,"Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. 6[As for] that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months."
Job,3,7,"Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein."
Job,3,8,"Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning."
Job,3,9,"Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but [have] none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:"
Job,3,10,"Because it shut not up the doors of my [mother’s] womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes."
Job,3,11,Why died I not from the womb? [why] did I [not] give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
Job,3,12,Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
Job,3,13,"For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,"
Job,3,14,"With kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;"
Job,3,15,"Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:"
Job,3,16,Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants [which] never saw light.
Job,3,17,There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary be at rest. 18[There] the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
Job,3,19,The small and great are there; and the servant [is] free from his master.
Job,3,20,"Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter [in] soul;"
Job,3,21,"Which long for death, but it [cometh] not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;"
Job,3,22,"Which rejoice exceedingly, [and] are glad, when they can find the grave? 23[Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?"
Job,3,24,"For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters."
Job,3,25,"For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me."
Job,3,26,"I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came."
Job,4,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 2[If] we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?"
Job,4,3,"Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands."
Job,4,4,"Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees."
Job,4,5,"But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. 6[Is] not [this] thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?"
Job,4,7,"Remember, I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?"
Job,4,8,"Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same."
Job,4,9,"By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed."
Job,4,10,"The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken."
Job,4,11,"The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad."
Job,4,12,"Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof."
Job,4,13,"In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,"
Job,4,14,"Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake."
Job,4,15,Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
Job,4,16,"It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image [was] before mine eyes, [there was] silence, and I heard a voice, [saying],"
Job,4,17,Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
Job,4,18,"Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:"
Job,4,19,"How much less [in] them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation [is] in the dust, [which] are crushed before the moth?"
Job,4,20,They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding [it].
Job,4,21,"Doth not their excellency [which is] in them go away? they die, even without wisdom."
Job,5,1,"Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?"
Job,5,2,"For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one."
Job,5,3,I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
Job,5,4,"His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither [is there] any to deliver [them]."
Job,5,5,"Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance."
Job,5,6,"Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;"
Job,5,7,"Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward."
Job,5,8,"I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:"
Job,5,9,Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:
Job,5,10,"Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:"
Job,5,11,To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
Job,5,12,"He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform [their] enterprise."
Job,5,13,He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
Job,5,14,"They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night."
Job,5,15,"But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty."
Job,5,16,"So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth."
Job,5,17,"Behold, happy [is] the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:"
Job,5,18,"For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole."
Job,5,19,"He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee."
Job,5,20,In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
Job,5,21,Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
Job,5,22,At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
Job,5,23,For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
Job,5,24,"And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle [shall be] in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin."
Job,5,25,"Thou shalt know also that thy seed [shall be] great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth."
Job,5,26,"Thou shalt come to [thy] grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season."
Job,5,27,"Lo this, we have searched it, so it [is]; hear it, and know thou [it] for thy good."
Job,6,1,"But Job answered and said,"
Job,6,2,"Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!"
Job,6,3,For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
Job,6,4,"For the arrows of the Almighty [are] within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me."
Job,6,5,Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
Job,6,6,Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there [any] taste in the white of an egg?
Job,6,7,The things [that] my soul refused to touch [are] as my sorrowful meat.
Job,6,8,Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for!
Job,6,9,"Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!"
Job,6,10,"Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One."
Job,6,11,"What [is] my strength, that I should hope? and what [is] mine end, that I should prolong my life? 12[Is] my strength the strength of stones? or [is] my flesh of brass? 13[Is] not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?"
Job,6,14,To him that is afflicted pity [should be shewed] from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
Job,6,15,"My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, [and] as the stream of brooks they pass away;"
Job,6,16,"Which are blackish by reason of the ice, [and] wherein the snow is hid:"
Job,6,17,"What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place."
Job,6,18,"The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish."
Job,6,19,"The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them."
Job,6,20,"They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed."
Job,6,21,"For now ye are nothing; ye see [my] casting down, and are afraid."
Job,6,22,"Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?"
Job,6,23,"Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?"
Job,6,24,"Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred."
Job,6,25,How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
Job,6,26,"Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, [which are] as wind?"
Job,6,27,"Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig [a pit] for your friend."
Job,6,28,"Now therefore be content, look upon me; for [it is] evident unto you if I lie."
Job,6,29,"Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness [is] in it."
Job,6,30,Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
Job,7,2,"As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for [the reward of] his work:"
Job,7,3,"So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me."
Job,7,4,"When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day."
Job,7,5,"My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome."
Job,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope."
Job,7,7,O remember that my life [is] wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
Job,7,8,"The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no [more]: thine eyes [are] upon me, and I [am] not. 9[As] the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no [more]."
Job,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more."
Job,7,11,"Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 12[Am] I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?"
Job,7,13,"When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;"
Job,7,14,"Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:"
Job,7,15,"So that my soul chooseth strangling, [and] death rather than my life."
Job,7,16,I loathe [it]; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days [are] vanity.
Job,7,17,"What [is] man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?"
Job,7,18,"And [that] thou shouldest visit him every morning, [and] try him every moment?"
Job,7,19,"How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?"
Job,7,20,"I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?"
Job,7,21,"And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I [shall] not [be]."
Job,8,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
Job,8,2,How long wilt thou speak these [things]? and [how long shall] the words of thy mouth [be like] a strong wind?
Job,8,3,Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
Job,8,4,"If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;"
Job,8,5,"If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;"
Job,8,6,"If thou [wert] pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous."
Job,8,7,"Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase."
Job,8,8,"For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 9(For we [are but of] yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth [are] a shadow:)"
Job,8,10,"Shall not they teach thee, [and] tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?"
Job,8,11,Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
Job,8,12,"Whilst it [is] yet in his greenness, [and] not cut down, it withereth before any [other] herb."
Job,8,13,So [are] the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish:
Job,8,14,"Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust [shall be] a spider’s web."
Job,8,15,"He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure."
Job,8,16,"He [is] green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden."
Job,8,17,"His roots are wrapped about the heap, [and] seeth the place of stones."
Job,8,18,"If he destroy him from his place, then [it] shall deny him, [saying], I have not seen thee."
Job,8,19,"Behold, this [is] the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow."
Job,8,20,"Behold, God will not cast away a perfect [man], neither will he help the evil doers:"
Job,8,21,"Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing."
Job,8,22,They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
Job,9,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,9,2,I know [it is] so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?
Job,9,3,"If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. 4[He is] wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened [himself] against him, and hath prospered?"
Job,9,5,"Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger."
Job,9,6,"Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble."
Job,9,7,"Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars."
Job,9,8,"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea."
Job,9,9,"Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south."
Job,9,10,"Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number."
Job,9,11,"Lo, he goeth by me, and I see [him] not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not."
Job,9,12,"Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? 13[If] God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him."
Job,9,14,"How much less shall I answer him, [and] choose out my words [to reason] with him?"
Job,9,15,"Whom, though I were righteous, [yet] would I not answer, [but] I would make supplication to my judge."
Job,9,16,"If I had called, and he had answered me; [yet] would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice."
Job,9,17,"For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause."
Job,9,18,"He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness."
Job,9,19,"If [I speak] of strength, lo, [he is] strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time [to plead]?"
Job,9,20,"If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: [if I say], I [am] perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. 21[Though] I [were] perfect, [yet] would I not know my soul: I would despise my life."
Job,9,22,"This [is] one [thing], therefore I said [it], He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked."
Job,9,23,"If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent."
Job,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, [and] who [is] he?"
Job,9,25,"Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good."
Job,9,26,They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle [that] hasteth to the prey.
Job,9,27,"If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort [myself]:"
Job,9,28,"I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. 29[If] I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?"
Job,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;"
Job,9,31,"Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me."
Job,9,32,"For [he is] not a man, as I [am, that] I should answer him, [and] we should come together in judgment."
Job,9,33,"Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, [that] might lay his hand upon us both."
Job,9,34,"Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: 35[Then] would I speak, and not fear him; but [it is] not so with me."
Job,10,1,My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,10,2,"I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. 3[Is it] good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,"Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? 5[Are] thy days as the days of man? [are] thy years as man’s days,"
Job,10,6,"That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?"
Job,10,7,Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and [there is] none that can deliver out of thine hand.
Job,10,8,Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
Job,10,9,"Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?"
Job,10,10,"Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?"
Job,10,11,"Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews."
Job,10,12,"Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit."
Job,10,13,And these [things] hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this [is] with thee.
Job,10,14,"If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity."
Job,10,15,"If I be wicked, woe unto me; and [if] I be righteous, [yet] will I not lift up my head. [I am] full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;"
Job,10,16,For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
Job,10,17,"Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war [are] against me."
Job,10,18,"Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!"
Job,10,19,"I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. 20[Are] not my days few? cease [then, and] let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,"
Job,10,21,"Before I go [whence] I shall not return, [even] to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;"
Job,10,22,"A land of darkness, as darkness [itself; and] of the shadow of death, without any order, and [where] the light [is] as darkness."
Job,11,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
Job,11,2,Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
Job,11,3,"Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?"
Job,11,4,"For thou hast said, My doctrine [is] pure, and I am clean in thine eyes."
Job,11,5,"But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;"
Job,11,6,"And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that [they are] double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee [less] than thine iniquity [deserveth]."
Job,11,7,Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? 8[It is] as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
Job,11,9,"The measure thereof [is] longer than the earth, and broader than the sea."
Job,11,10,"If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?"
Job,11,11,For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider [it]?
Job,11,12,"For vain man would be wise, though man be born [like] a wild ass’s colt."
Job,11,13,"If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;"
Job,11,14,"If iniquity [be] in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles."
Job,11,15,"For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:"
Job,11,16,"Because thou shalt forget [thy] misery, [and] remember [it] as waters [that] pass away:"
Job,11,17,"And [thine] age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning."
Job,11,18,"And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig [about thee, and] thou shalt take thy rest in safety."
Job,11,19,"Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make [thee] afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee."
Job,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope [shall be as] the giving up of the ghost."
Job,12,1,"And Job answered and said,"
Job,12,2,"No doubt but ye [are] the people, and wisdom shall die with you."
Job,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you; I [am] not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?"
Job,12,4,"I am [as] one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright [man is] laughed to scorn."
Job,12,5,He that is ready to slip with [his] feet [is as] a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
Job,12,6,"The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth [abundantly]."
Job,12,7,"But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:"
Job,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee."
Job,12,9,Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
Job,12,10,"In whose hand [is] the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind."
Job,12,11,Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?
Job,12,12,With the ancient [is] wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
Job,12,13,"With him [is] wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding."
Job,12,14,"Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening."
Job,12,15,"Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth."
Job,12,16,With him [is] strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver [are] his.
Job,12,17,"He leadeth counsellers away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools."
Job,12,18,"He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle."
Job,12,19,"He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty."
Job,12,20,"He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged."
Job,12,21,"He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty."
Job,12,22,"He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death."
Job,12,23,"He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them [again]."
Job,12,24,"He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness [where there is] no way."
Job,12,25,"They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like [a] drunken [man]."
Job,13,1,"Lo, mine eye hath seen all [this], mine ear hath heard and understood it."
Job,13,2,"What ye know, [the same] do I know also: I [am] not inferior unto you."
Job,13,3,"Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God."
Job,13,4,"But ye [are] forgers of lies, ye [are] all physicians of no value."
Job,13,5,O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
Job,13,6,"Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips."
Job,13,7,Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
Job,13,8,Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
Job,13,9,"Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye [so] mock him?"
Job,13,10,"He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons."
Job,13,11,Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
Job,13,12,"Your remembrances [are] like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay."
Job,13,13,"Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what [will]."
Job,13,14,"Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?"
Job,13,15,"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him."
Job,13,16,He also [shall be] my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
Job,13,17,"Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears."
Job,13,18,"Behold now, I have ordered [my] cause; I know that I shall be justified."
Job,13,19,"Who [is] he [that] will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost."
Job,13,20,Only do not two [things] unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
Job,13,21,Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
Job,13,22,"Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me."
Job,13,23,How many [are] mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
Job,13,24,"Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?"
Job,13,25,Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
Job,13,26,"For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth."
Job,13,27,"Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet."
Job,13,28,"And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten."
Job,14,1,"Man [that is] born of a woman [is] of few days, and full of trouble."
Job,14,2,"He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not."
Job,14,3,"And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?"
Job,14,4,Who can bring a clean [thing] out of an unclean? not one.
Job,14,5,"Seeing his days [are] determined, the number of his months [are] with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;"
Job,14,6,"Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day."
Job,14,7,"For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease."
Job,14,8,"Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; 9[Yet] through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant."
Job,14,10,"But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where [is] he? 11[As] the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:"
Job,14,12,"So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens [be] no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep."
Job,14,13,"O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
Job,14,14,"If a man die, shall he live [again]? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come."
Job,14,15,"Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands."
Job,14,16,For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?
Job,14,17,"My transgression [is] sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity."
Job,14,18,"And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place."
Job,14,19,The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow [out] of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.
Job,14,20,"Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away."
Job,14,21,"His sons come to honour, and he knoweth [it] not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth [it] not of them."
Job,14,22,"But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn."
Job,15,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,"
Job,15,2,"Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?"
Job,15,3,Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
Job,15,4,"Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God."
Job,15,5,"For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty."
Job,15,6,"Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee. 7[Art] thou the first man [that] was born? or wast thou made before the hills?"
Job,15,8,Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
Job,15,9,"What knowest thou, that we know not? [what] understandest thou, which [is] not in us?"
Job,15,10,"With us [are] both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father. 11[Are] the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?"
Job,15,12,"Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,"
Job,15,13,"That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest [such] words go out of thy mouth?"
Job,15,14,"What [is] man, that he should be clean? and [he which is] born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
Job,15,15,"Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight."
Job,15,16,"How much more abominable and filthy [is] man, which drinketh iniquity like water?"
Job,15,17,"I will shew thee, hear me; and that [which] I have seen I will declare;"
Job,15,18,"Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid [it]:"
Job,15,19,"Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them."
Job,15,20,"The wicked man travaileth with pain all [his] days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor."
Job,15,21,A dreadful sound [is] in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
Job,15,22,"He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword."
Job,15,23,"He wandereth abroad for bread, [saying], Where [is it]? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand."
Job,15,24,"Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle."
Job,15,25,"For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty."
Job,15,26,"He runneth upon him, [even] on [his] neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:"
Job,15,27,"Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on [his] flanks."
Job,15,28,"And he dwelleth in desolate cities, [and] in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps."
Job,15,29,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth."
Job,15,30,"He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away."
Job,15,31,Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.
Job,15,32,"It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green."
Job,15,33,"He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive."
Job,15,34,"For the congregation of hypocrites [shall be] desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery."
Job,15,35,"They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit."
Job,16,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,16,2,I have heard many such things: miserable comforters [are] ye all.
Job,16,3,Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
Job,16,4,"I also could speak as ye [do]: if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. 5[But] I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage [your grief]."
Job,16,6,"Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and [though] I forbear, what am I eased?"
Job,16,7,But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
Job,16,8,"And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, [which] is a witness [against me]: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face."
Job,16,9,"He teareth [me] in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me."
Job,16,10,They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
Job,16,11,"God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked."
Job,16,12,"I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken [me] by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark."
Job,16,13,"His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground."
Job,16,14,"He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant."
Job,16,15,"I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust."
Job,16,16,"My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids [is] the shadow of death;"
Job,16,17,Not for [any] injustice in mine hands: also my prayer [is] pure.
Job,16,18,"O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place."
Job,16,19,"Also now, behold, my witness [is] in heaven, and my record [is] on high."

Job,16,22,"When a few years are come, then I shall go the way [whence] I shall not return."
Job,17,1,"My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves [are ready] for me. 2[Are there] not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?"
Job,17,3,"Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who [is] he [that] will strike hands with me?"
Job,17,4,For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt [them].
Job,17,5,"He that speaketh flattery to [his] friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail."

Job,17,10,"But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find [one] wise [man] among you."
Job,17,11,"My days are past, my purposes are broken off, [even] the thoughts of my heart."
Job,17,12,They change the night into day: the light [is] short because of darkness.
Job,17,13,"If I wait, the grave [is] mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness."
Job,17,14,"I have said to corruption, Thou [art] my father: to the worm, [Thou art] my mother, and my sister."

Job,18,2,"How long [will it be ere] ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak."
Job,18,3,"Wherefore are we counted as beasts, [and] reputed vile in your sight?"
Job,18,4,He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
Job,18,5,"Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine."
Job,18,6,"The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him."
Job,18,7,"The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down."
Job,18,8,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare."

Job,18,14,"His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors."
Job,18,15,"It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because [it is] none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation."

Job,19,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,19,2,"How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?"
Job,19,3,These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed [that] ye make yourselves strange to me.
Job,19,4,"And be it indeed [that] I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself."
Job,19,5,"If indeed ye will magnify [yourselves] against me, and plead against me my reproach:"
Job,19,6,"Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net."

Job,19,21,"Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me."
Job,19,22,"Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?"
Job,19,23,Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
Job,19,24,That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!
Job,19,25,"For I know [that] my redeemer liveth, and [that] he shall stand at the latter [day] upon the earth:"
Job,19,26,"And [though] after my skin [worms] destroy this [body], yet in my flesh shall I see God:"
Job,19,27,"Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; [though] my reins be consumed within me."
Job,19,28,"But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?"
Job,19,29,"Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath [bringeth] the punishments of the sword, that ye may know [there is] a judgment."
Job,20,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
Job,20,2,"Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for [this] I make haste."
Job,20,3,"I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer."
Job,20,4,"Knowest thou [not] this of old, since man was placed upon earth,"
Job,20,5,"That the triumphing of the wicked [is] short, and the joy of the hypocrite [but] for a moment?"
Job,20,6,"Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; 7[Yet] he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where [is] he?"
Job,20,8,"He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night."

Job,20,10,"His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods."
Job,20,11,"His bones are full [of the sin] of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust."
Job,20,12,"Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, [though] he hide it under his tongue; 13[Though] he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: 14[Yet] his meat in his bowels is turned, [it is] the gall of asps within him."
Job,20,15,"He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly."
Job,20,16,He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.
Job,20,17,"He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter."
Job,20,18,"That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow [it] down: according to [his] substance [shall] the restitution [be], and he shall not rejoice [therein]."
Job,20,19,Because he hath oppressed [and] hath forsaken the poor; [because] he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
Job,20,20,"Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired."
Job,20,21,There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
Job,20,22,"In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. 23[When] he is about to fill his belly, [God] shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain [it] upon him while he is eating."
Job,20,24,"He shall flee from the iron weapon, [and] the bow of steel shall strike him through."
Job,20,25,"It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors [are] upon him."

Job,21,2,"Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations."
Job,21,3,"Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on."

Job,21,5,"Mark me, and be astonished, and lay [your] hand upon [your] mouth."
Job,21,6,"Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh."
Job,21,7,"Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?"
Job,21,8,"Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes."
Job,21,9,"Their houses [are] safe from fear, neither [is] the rod of God upon them."
Job,21,10,"Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf."
Job,21,11,"They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance."
Job,21,12,"They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ."
Job,21,13,"They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave."
Job,21,14,"Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways."
Job,21,15,"What [is] the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?"
Job,21,16,"Lo, their good [is] not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
Job,21,17,How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and [how oft] cometh their destruction upon them! [God] distributeth sorrows in his anger.
Job,21,18,"They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away."
Job,21,19,"God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know [it]."
Job,21,20,"His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
Job,21,21,"For what pleasure [hath] he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?"
Job,21,22,Shall [any] teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
Job,21,23,"One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet."
Job,21,24,"His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow."
Job,21,25,"And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure."
Job,21,26,"They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them."
Job,21,27,"Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices [which] ye wrongfully imagine against me."
Job,21,28,"For ye say, Where [is] the house of the prince? and where [are] the dwelling places of the wicked?"
Job,21,29,"Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,"
Job,21,30,That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
Job,21,31,Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him [what] he hath done?
Job,21,32,"Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb."
Job,21,33,"The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as [there are] innumerable before him."
Job,21,34,"How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?"
Job,22,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,"
Job,22,2,"Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 3[Is it] any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or [is it] gain [to him], that thou makest thy ways perfect?"
Job,22,4,Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? 5[Is] not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?
Job,22,6,"For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing."
Job,22,7,"Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry."
Job,22,8,"But [as for] the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it."
Job,22,9,"Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken."
Job,22,10,"Therefore snares [are] round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;"
Job,22,11,"Or darkness, [that] thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. 12[Is] not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!"
Job,22,13,"And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?"
Job,22,14,"Thick clouds [are] a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven."
Job,22,15,Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
Job,22,16,"Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:"
Job,22,17,"Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?"
Job,22,18,Yet he filled their houses with good [things]: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job,22,19,"The righteous see [it], and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn."
Job,22,20,"Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth."
Job,22,21,"Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee."
Job,22,22,"Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart."
Job,22,23,"If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles."
Job,22,24,"Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the [gold] of Ophir as the stones of the brooks."
Job,22,25,"Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver."
Job,22,26,"For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God."
Job,22,27,"Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows."
Job,22,28,"Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways."
Job,22,29,"When [men] are cast down, then thou shalt say, [There is] lifting up; and he shall save the humble person."
Job,22,30,He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
Job,23,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,23,2,Even to day [is] my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
Job,23,3,Oh that I knew where I might find him! [that] I might come [even] to his seat!
Job,23,4,"I would order [my] cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments."
Job,23,5,"I would know the words [which] he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me."
Job,23,6,Will he plead against me with [his] great power? No; but he would put [strength] in me.
Job,23,7,There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
Job,23,8,"Behold, I go forward, but he [is] not [there]; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:"
Job,23,9,"On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold [him]: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see [him]:"
Job,23,10,"But he knoweth the way that I take: [when] he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold."
Job,23,11,"My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined."
Job,23,12,Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary [food].
Job,23,13,"But he [is] in one [mind], and who can turn him? and [what] his soul desireth, even [that] he doeth."
Job,23,14,For he performeth [the thing that is] appointed for me: and many such [things are] with him.
Job,23,15,"Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him."
Job,23,16,"For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:"
Job,23,17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness, [neither] hath he covered the darkness from my face."
Job,24,1,"Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? 2[Some] remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed [thereof]."
Job,24,3,"They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge."
Job,24,4,They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
Job,24,5,"Behold, [as] wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness [yieldeth] food for them [and] for [their] children."
Job,24,6,They reap [every one] his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
Job,24,7,"They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that [they have] no covering in the cold."
Job,24,8,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter."
Job,24,9,"They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor."
Job,24,10,"They cause [him] to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf [from] the hungry; 11[Which] make oil within their walls, [and] tread [their] winepresses, and suffer thirst."
Job,24,12,"Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly [to them]."
Job,24,13,"They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof."
Job,24,14,"The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief."
Job,24,15,"The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth [his] face."
Job,24,16,"In the dark they dig through houses, [which] they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light."
Job,24,17,"For the morning [is] to them even as the shadow of death: if [one] know [them, they are in] the terrors of the shadow of death."
Job,24,18,He [is] swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
Job,24,19,Drought and heat consume the snow waters: [so doth] the grave [those which] have sinned.
Job,24,20,The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
Job,24,21,He evil entreateth the barren [that] beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.
Job,24,22,"He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no [man] is sure of life. 23[Though] it be given him [to be] in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes [are] upon their ways."
Job,24,24,"They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all [other], and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn."
Job,24,25,"And if [it be] not [so] now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?"
Job,25,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
Job,25,2,"Dominion and fear [are] with him, he maketh peace in his high places."
Job,25,3,Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
Job,25,4,How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean [that is] born of a woman?
Job,25,5,"Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight."
Job,25,6,"How much less man, [that is] a worm? and the son of man, [which is] a worm?"
Job,26,1,"But Job answered and said,"
Job,26,2,How hast thou helped [him that is] without power? [how] savest thou the arm [that hath] no strength?
Job,26,3,How hast thou counselled [him that hath] no wisdom? and [how] hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
Job,26,4,To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
Job,26,5,"Dead [things] are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof."
Job,26,6,"Hell [is] naked before him, and destruction hath no covering."
Job,26,7,"He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, [and] hangeth the earth upon nothing."

Job,26,11,The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
Job,26,12,"He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud."
Job,26,13,By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
Job,26,14,"Lo, these [are] parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?"
Job,27,1,"Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 2[As] God liveth, [who] hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, [who] hath vexed my soul;"
Job,27,3,"All the while my breath [is] in me, and the spirit of God [is] in my nostrils;"
Job,27,4,"My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit."
Job,27,5,God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
Job,27,6,"My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach [me] so long as I live. The Wicked Man’s Portion"
Job,27,7,"Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous."
Job,27,8,"For what [is] the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?"
Job,27,9,Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
Job,27,10,Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
Job,27,11,I will teach you by the hand of God: [that] which [is] with the Almighty will I not conceal.
Job,27,12,"Behold, all ye yourselves have seen [it]; why then are ye thus altogether vain?"
Job,27,13,"This [is] the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, [which] they shall receive of the Almighty."

Job,27,17,"He may prepare [it], but the just shall put [it] on, and the innocent shall divide the silver."
Job,27,18,"He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth [that] the keeper maketh."
Job,27,19,"The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he [is] not."
Job,27,20,"Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night."
Job,27,21,"The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place."
Job,27,22,"For [God] shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. 23[Men] shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place."

Job,28,10,He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
Job,28,11,He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and [the thing that is] hid bringeth he forth to light.
Job,28,12,But where shall wisdom be found? and where [is] the place of understanding?
Job,28,13,Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
Job,28,14,"The depth saith, It [is] not in me: and the sea saith, [It is] not with me."
Job,28,15,"It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed [for] the price thereof."
Job,28,16,"It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire."
Job,28,17,The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it [shall not be for] jewels of fine gold.
Job,28,18,"No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom [is] above rubies."
Job,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold."
Job,28,20,Whence then cometh wisdom? and where [is] the place of understanding?
Job,28,21,"Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air."
Job,28,22,"Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears."
Job,28,23,"God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof."
Job,28,24,"For he looketh to the ends of the earth, [and] seeth under the whole heaven;"
Job,28,25,To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
Job,28,26,"When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:"
Job,28,27,"Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out."
Job,28,28,"And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that [is] wisdom; and to depart from evil [is] understanding."
Job,29,1,"Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,"
Job,29,2,"Oh that I were as [in] months past, as [in] the days [when] God preserved me;"
Job,29,3,"When his candle shined upon my head, [and when] by his light I walked [through] darkness;"
Job,29,4,"As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God [was] upon my tabernacle;"
Job,29,5,"When the Almighty [was] yet with me, [when] my children [were] about me;"
Job,29,6,"When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;"
Job,29,7,"When I went out to the gate through the city, [when] I prepared my seat in the street!"
Job,29,8,"The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, [and] stood up."
Job,29,9,"The princes refrained talking, and laid [their] hand on their mouth."
Job,29,10,"The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth."
Job,29,11,"When the ear heard [me], then it blessed me; and when the eye saw [me], it gave witness to me:"
Job,29,12,"Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and [him that had] none to help him."
Job,29,13,The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
Job,29,14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment [was] as a robe and a diadem."
Job,29,15,"I was eyes to the blind, and feet [was] I to the lame."
Job,29,16,I [was] a father to the poor: and the cause [which] I knew not I searched out.
Job,29,17,"And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth."
Job,29,18,"Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply [my] days as the sand."
Job,29,19,"My root [was] spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch."
Job,29,20,"My glory [was] fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand."
Job,29,21,"Unto me [men] gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel."
Job,29,22,After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
Job,29,23,"And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide [as] for the latter rain. 24[If] I laughed on them, they believed [it] not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down."
Job,29,25,"I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one [that] comforteth the mourners."
Job,30,1,"But now [they that are] younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock."
Job,30,2,"Yea, whereto [might] the strength of their hands [profit] me, in whom old age was perished?"
Job,30,3,For want and famine [they were] solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
Job,30,4,"Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots [for] their meat."
Job,30,5,"They were driven forth from among [men], (they cried after them as [after] a thief;)"
Job,30,6,"To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, [in] caves of the earth, and [in] the rocks."
Job,30,7,"Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together. 8[They were] children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth."
Job,30,9,"And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword."
Job,30,10,"They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face."
Job,30,11,"Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me."
Job,30,12,"Upon [my] right [hand] rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction."
Job,30,13,"They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper."
Job,30,14,They came [upon me] as a wide breaking in [of waters]: in the desolation they rolled themselves [upon me]. Job’s Prosperity Becomes Calamity
Job,30,15,Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
Job,30,16,And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
Job,30,17,My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
Job,30,18,By the great force [of my disease] is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
Job,30,19,"He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes."
Job,30,20,"I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me [not]."
Job,30,21,Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
Job,30,22,"Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride [upon it], and dissolvest my substance."
Job,30,23,"For I know [that] thou wilt bring me [to] death, and [to] the house appointed for all living."
Job,30,24,"Howbeit he will not stretch out [his] hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction."
Job,30,25,Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was [not] my soul grieved for the poor?
Job,30,26,"When I looked for good, then evil came [unto me]: and when I waited for light, there came darkness."
Job,30,27,"My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me."
Job,30,28,"I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, [and] I cried in the congregation."
Job,30,29,"I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls."
Job,30,30,"My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat."
Job,30,31,"My harp also is [turned] to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep."
Job,31,1,I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
Job,31,2,For what portion of God [is there] from above? and [what] inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 3[Is] not destruction to the wicked? and a strange [punishment] to the workers of iniquity?
Job,31,4,"Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?"
Job,31,5,"If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;"
Job,31,6,"Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity."
Job,31,7,"If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 8[Then] let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out."
Job,31,9,"If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or [if] I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door; 10[Then] let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her."
Job,31,11,"For this [is] an heinous crime; yea, it [is] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judges."
Job,31,12,"For it [is] a fire [that] consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase."
Job,31,13,"If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;"
Job,31,14,"What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?"
Job,31,15,Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
Job,31,16,"If I have withheld the poor from [their] desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;"
Job,31,17,"Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; 18(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as [with] a father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;)"
Job,31,19,"If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;"
Job,31,20,"If his loins have not blessed me, and [if] he were [not] warmed with the fleece of my sheep;"
Job,31,21,"If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: 22[Then] let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone."
Job,31,23,"For destruction [from] God [was] a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure."
Job,31,24,"If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, [Thou art] my confidence;"
Job,31,25,"If I rejoiced because my wealth [was] great, and because mine hand had gotten much;"
Job,31,26,"If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking [in] brightness;"
Job,31,27,"And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:"
Job,31,28,This also [were] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judge: for I should have denied the God [that is] above.
Job,31,29,"If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:"
Job,31,30,Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
Job,31,31,"If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied."
Job,31,32,The stranger did not lodge in the street: [but] I opened my doors to the traveller.
Job,31,33,"If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:"
Job,31,34,"Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, [and] went not out of the door?"
Job,31,35,"Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire [is, that] the Almighty would answer me, and [that] mine adversary had written a book."
Job,31,36,"Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, [and] bind it [as] a crown to me."
Job,31,37,I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
Job,31,38,"If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;"
Job,31,39,"If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:"
Job,31,40,"Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended."
Job,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he [was] righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his"
Job,32,3,Also against his three friends was his
Job,32,4,Now Elihu had
Job,32,5,"When Elihu saw that [there was] no answer in the mouth of [these] three men, then his wrath was kindled."
Job,32,6,"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I [am] young, and ye [are] very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion."
Job,32,7,"I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom."
Job,32,8,But [there is] a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
Job,32,9,Great men are not [always] wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
Job,32,10,"Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion."
Job,32,11,"Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say."
Job,32,12,"Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, [there was] none of you that convinced Job, [or] that answered his words:"
Job,32,13,"Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man."
Job,32,14,Now he hath not directed [his] words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
Job,32,15,"They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking."
Job,32,16,"When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, [and] answered no more;) 17[I said], I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion."
Job,32,18,"For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me."
Job,32,19,"Behold, my belly [is] as wine [which] hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles."
Job,32,20,"I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer."
Job,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man."
Job,32,22,For I know not to give flattering titles; [in so doing] my maker would soon take me away.
Job,33,1,"Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words."
Job,33,2,"Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth."
Job,33,3,My words [shall be of] the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
Job,33,4,"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life."
Job,33,5,"If thou canst answer me, set [thy words] in order before me, stand up."
Job,33,6,"Behold, I [am] according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay."
Job,33,7,"Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee."
Job,33,8,"Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of [thy] words, [saying],"
Job,33,9,"I am clean without transgression, I [am] innocent; neither [is there] iniquity in me."
Job,33,10,"Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,"
Job,33,11,"He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths."
Job,33,12,"Behold, [in] this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man."
Job,33,13,Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
Job,33,14,"For God speaketh once, yea twice, [yet man] perceiveth it not."
Job,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;"
Job,33,16,"Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,"
Job,33,17,"That he may withdraw man [from his] purpose, and hide pride from man."
Job,33,18,"He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword."
Job,33,19,"He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong [pain]:"
Job,33,20,"So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat."
Job,33,21,"His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones [that] were not seen stick out."
Job,33,22,"Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers."
Job,33,23,"If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:"
Job,33,24,"Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom."
Job,33,25,His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:
Job,33,26,"He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness."
Job,33,27,"He looketh upon men, and [if any] say, I have sinned, and perverted [that which was] right, and it profited me not;"
Job,33,28,"He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light."
Job,33,29,"Lo, all these [things] worketh God oftentimes with man,"
Job,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living."
Job,33,31,"Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak."
Job,33,32,"If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee."
Job,33,33,"If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom."
Job,34,1,"Furthermore Elihu answered and said,"
Job,34,2,"Hear my words, O ye wise [men]; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge."
Job,34,3,"For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat."
Job,34,4,Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what [is] good.
Job,34,5,"For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment."
Job,34,6,Should I lie against my right? my wound [is] incurable without transgression.
Job,34,7,"What man [is] like Job, [who] drinketh up scorning like water?"
Job,34,8,"Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men."
Job,34,9,"For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God."
Job,34,10,"Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, [that he should do] wickedness; and [from] the Almighty, [that he should commit] iniquity."
Job,34,11,"For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to [his] ways."
Job,34,12,"Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment."
Job,34,13,Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
Job,34,14,"If he set his heart upon man, [if] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;"
Job,34,15,"All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust."
Job,34,16,"If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words."
Job,34,17,"Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? 18[Is it fit] to say to a king, [Thou art] wicked? [and] to princes, [Ye are] ungodly? 19[How much less to him] that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all [are] the work of his hands."
Job,34,20,"In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand."
Job,34,21,"For his eyes [are] upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. 22[There is] no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
Job,34,23,For he will not lay upon man more [than right]; that he should enter into judgment with God.
Job,34,24,"He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead."
Job,34,25,"Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth [them] in the night, so that they are destroyed."
Job,34,26,He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
Job,34,27,"Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:"
Job,34,28,"So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted."
Job,34,29,"When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth [his] face, who then can behold him? whether [it be done] against a nation, or against a man only:"
Job,34,30,"That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared."
Job,34,31,"Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [any more]: 32[That which] I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. 33[Should it be] according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest."
Job,34,34,"Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me."
Job,34,35,"Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words [were] without wisdom."
Job,34,36,My desire [is that] Job may be tried unto the end because of [his] answers for wicked men.
Job,34,37,"For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his hands] among us, and multiplieth his words against God."
Job,35,1,"Elihu spake moreover, and said,"
Job,35,2,"Thinkest thou this to be right, [that] thou saidst, My righteousness [is] more than God’s?"
Job,35,3,"For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? [and], What profit shall I have, [if I be cleansed] from my sin?"
Job,35,4,"I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee."
Job,35,5,"Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds [which] are higher than thou."
Job,35,6,"If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or [if] thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?"
Job,35,7,"If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?"
Job,35,8,Thy wickedness [may hurt] a man as thou [art]; and thy righteousness [may profit] the son of man.
Job,35,9,By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make [the oppressed] to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job,35,10,"But none saith, Where [is] God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;"
Job,35,11,"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?"
Job,35,12,"There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men."
Job,35,13,"Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it."
Job,35,14,"Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, [yet] judgment [is] before him; therefore trust thou in him."
Job,35,15,"But now, because [it is] not [so], he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth [it] not in great extremity:"
Job,35,16,Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
Job,36,1,"Elihu also proceeded, and said,"
Job,36,2,"Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that [I have] yet to speak on God’s behalf."
Job,36,3,"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
Job,36,4,For truly my words [shall] not [be] false: he that is perfect in knowledge [is] with thee.
Job,36,5,"Behold, God [is] mighty, and despiseth not [any: he is] mighty in strength [and] wisdom."
Job,36,6,He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
Job,36,7,"He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings [are they] on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"And if [they be] bound in fetters, [and] be holden in cords of affliction;"
Job,36,9,"Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded."
Job,36,10,"He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity."
Job,36,11,"If they obey and serve [him], they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures."
Job,36,12,"But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge."
Job,36,13,But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
Job,36,14,"They die in youth, and their life [is] among the unclean."
Job,36,15,"He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression."
Job,36,16,"Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait [into] a broad place, where [there is] no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table [should be] full of fatness."
Job,36,17,But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold [on thee].
Job,36,18,"Because [there is] wrath, [beware] lest he take thee away with [his] stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee."
Job,36,19,"Will he esteem thy riches? [no], not gold, nor all the forces of strength."
Job,36,20,"Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place."
Job,36,21,"Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction."
Job,36,22,"Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?"
Job,36,23,"Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?"
Job,36,24,"Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold."
Job,36,25,Every man may see it; man may behold [it] afar off.
Job,36,26,"Behold, God [is] great, and we know [him] not, neither can the number of his years be searched out."
Job,36,27,For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
Job,36,28,Which the clouds do drop [and] distil upon man abundantly.
Job,36,29,"Also can [any] understand the spreadings of the clouds, [or] the noise of his tabernacle?"
Job,36,30,"Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea."
Job,36,31,For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
Job,36,32,With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it [not to shine] by [the cloud] that cometh betwixt.
Job,36,33,"The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour."
Job,37,1,"At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place."
Job,37,2,"Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound [that] goeth out of his mouth."
Job,37,3,"He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth."
Job,37,4,After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
Job,37,5,"God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend."
Job,37,6,"For he saith to the snow, Be thou [on] the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength."
Job,37,7,He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
Job,37,8,"Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places."
Job,37,9,Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
Job,37,10,By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
Job,37,11,Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:
Job,37,12,And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.

Ecclesiastes,7,1,"A good name [is] better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth. 2[It is] better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that [is] the end of all men; and the living will lay [it] to his heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,3,Sorrow [is] better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
Ecclesiastes,7,4,"The heart of the wise [is] in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools [is] in the house of mirth. 5[It is] better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools."
Ecclesiastes,7,6,"For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so [is] the laughter of the fool: this also [is] vanity."
Ecclesiastes,7,7,Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.
Ecclesiastes,7,8,Better [is] the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: [and] the patient in spirit [is] better than the proud in spirit.
Ecclesiastes,7,9,Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
Ecclesiastes,7,10,"Say not thou, What is [the cause] that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this."
Ecclesiastes,7,11,Wisdom [is] good with an inheritance: and [by it there is] profit to them that see the sun.

Ecclesiastes,8,13,"But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong [his] days, [which are] as a shadow; because he feareth not before God. God’s Ways Are Mysterious"

Ecclesiastes,8,15,"Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,8,16,"When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth:"
Ecclesiastes,8,17,"Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek [it] out, yet he shall not find [it]; yea further; though a wise [man] think to know [it], yet shall he not be able to find [it]."
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, [are] in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred [by] all [that is] before them."

Jeremiah,26,19,"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls. The Prophet Uriah"

Jeremiah,28,10,"Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it."
Jeremiah,28,11,"And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way."

Jeremiah,29,28,"For therefore he sent unto us [in] Babylon, saying, This [captivity is] long: build ye houses, and dwell [in them]; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them."
Jeremiah,29,29,And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,29,30,Then came the word

Jeremiah,29,32,"Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD."
Jeremiah,30,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,30,2,"Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel,"
Jeremiah,30,3,"For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it."
Jeremiah,30,4,And these [are] the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
Jeremiah,30,5,"For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,"Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?"
Jeremiah,30,7,"Alas! for that day [is] great, so that none [is] like it: it [is] even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it."

Jeremiah,30,11,"For I [am] with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished."
Jeremiah,30,12,"For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise [is] incurable, [and] thy wound [is] grievous. 13[There is] none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines."
Jeremiah,30,14,"All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; [because] thy sins were increased."
Jeremiah,30,15,"Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow [is] incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: [because] thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee."

Jeremiah,31,5,"Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat [them] as common things."
Jeremiah,31,6,"For there shall be a day, [that] the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God."
Jeremiah,31,7,"For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel."
Jeremiah,31,8,"Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, [and] with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither."
Jeremiah,31,9,"They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim [is] my firstborn."
Jeremiah,31,10,"Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare [it] in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd [doth] his flock."
Jeremiah,31,11,"For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of [him that was] stronger than he."
Jeremiah,31,12,"Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all."

Daniel,1,7,"Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel [the name] of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego. Daniel’s Faithfulness"

Daniel,1,14,"So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days."
Daniel,1,15,And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of

Daniel,1,17,"As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams."

Daniel,2,3,"And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream."
Daniel,2,4,"Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream,"

Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore [there is] no king, lord, nor ruler,"
Daniel,2,11,"And [it is] a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."
Daniel,2,12,"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise [men]"
Daniel,2,13,And the decree went forth that the wise [men] should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. The Dream Revealed to Daniel
Daniel,2,14,"Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was"
Daniel,2,15,"He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain,"
Daniel,2,16,"Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his"
Daniel,2,18,That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise [men] of Babylon.
Daniel,2,19,Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel,2,20,"Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:"
Daniel,2,21,"And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:"
Daniel,2,22,"He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what [is] in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him."
Daniel,2,23,"I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast [now] made known unto us the king’s matter. Daniel Interprets the Dream"
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise [men] of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise [men] of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man"
Daniel,2,26,"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise [men], the astrologers, the magicians,"
Daniel,2,28,"But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy"
Daniel,2,29,"As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall"
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for [any] wisdom that I have more than any living, but for [their] sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart."
Daniel,2,31,"Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness [was] excellent,"
Daniel,2,32,"This image’s head [was] of fine gold, his"
Daniel,2,33,"His legs of iron, his feet part of iron"
Daniel,2,34,"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image"
Daniel,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,This [is] the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
Daniel,2,37,"Thou, O king, [art] a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory."
Daniel,2,38,"And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou [art] this head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth."
Daniel,2,40,And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth
Daniel,2,41,"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there"
Daniel,2,42,"And [as] the toes of the feet [were] part of iron, and part of clay, [so] the kingdom shall be partly strong,"
Daniel,2,43,"And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay."
Daniel,2,44,"And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, [but] it shall break in pieces and consume"
Daniel,2,45,"Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream [is] certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel"

Daniel,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and"

Daniel,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, [and] spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come [hither]. Then Shadrach, Meshach,"
Daniel,3,27,"And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellers, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them. 28[Then] Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed [be] the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."

Daniel,4,4,"I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:"
Daniel,4,5,I saw a dream which
Daniel,4,6,"Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise [men] of Babylon before me, that they might make known"
Daniel,4,7,"Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the"
Daniel,4,8,"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom [is] the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told"
Daniel,4,9,"O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods [is] in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof."
Daniel,4,10,"Thus [were] the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof [was] great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:"
Daniel,4,12,"The leaves thereof [were] fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it [was] meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it."
Daniel,4,13,"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;"
Daniel,4,14,"He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:"
Daniel,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts in the grass of the earth:"
Daniel,4,16,"Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him."
Daniel,4,17,"This matter [is] by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men."
Daniel,4,18,"This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise [men] of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou [art] able; for the spirit of the holy gods [is] in thee. Daniel Interprets the Second Dream"
Daniel,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream [be] to them that hate thee, and the"
Daniel,4,20,"The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong,"

Daniel,4,22,"It [is] thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion"
Daniel,4,23,"And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;"
Daniel,4,24,"This [is] the interpretation, O king, and this [is] the decree of the most High, which is come upon"
Daniel,4,25,"That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom"
Daniel,4,26,"And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens"
Daniel,4,27,"Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity. The Second Dream Fulfilled"
Daniel,4,28,All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,4,29,At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace
Daniel,4,30,"The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for"
Daniel,4,31,"While the word [was] in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, [saying], O king Nebuchadnezzar, to"

Daniel,4,33,"The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’ [feathers], and his nails like birds’ [claws]. Nebuchadnezzar Restored"
Daniel,4,34,"And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion [is] an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom [is] from generation to generation:"
Daniel,4,35,"And all the inhabitants of the earth [are] reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and [among] the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?"
Daniel,4,36,"At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellers and my lords sought unto me; and I was established"
Daniel,4,37,"Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works [are] truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase."
Daniel,5,1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand."

Daniel,5,12,"Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation. Daniel Interprets the Handwriting"
Daniel,5,13,"Then was Daniel brought in before the king. [And] the king spake and said unto Daniel, [Art] thou that Daniel, which [art] of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out"

Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened"
Daniel,5,21,"And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling [was] with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and [that] he appointeth over it whomsoever he"
Daniel,5,22,"And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;"
Daniel,5,23,"But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath [is], and whose [are] all thy ways, hast thou not"
Daniel,5,24,Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
Daniel,5,25,"And this [is] the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN."
Daniel,5,26,This [is] the

Daniel,5,29,"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and [put] a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
Daniel,5,31,"And Darius the Median took the kingdom, [being] about threescore and two years old."

Daniel,6,6,"Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King"
Daniel,6,7,"All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellers, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast"

Daniel,6,12,"Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask [a petition] of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing [is] true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth"
Daniel,6,13,"Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which [is] of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day."
Daniel,6,14,"Then the king, when he heard [these] words, was sore displeased with himself, and set [his] heart"
Daniel,6,15,"Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians [is], That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed."
Daniel,6,16,"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast [him] into the den of lions. [Now] the"
Daniel,6,17,"And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet,"
Daniel,6,18,"Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him."
Daniel,6,19,"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions."
Daniel,6,20,"And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: [and] the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver"
Daniel,6,21,"Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever."
Daniel,6,22,"My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency"
Daniel,6,23,"Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast [them] into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den. Darius Honors God"
Daniel,6,25,"Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you."
Daniel,6,26,"I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he [is] the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion [shall be even] unto the end."
Daniel,6,27,"He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions."
Daniel,6,28,"So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian."

Daniel,7,7,"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it [was] diverse from all the beasts that [were] before it;"
Daniel,7,8,"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn [were] eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things. Daniel’s Vision of the Ancient of Days"
Daniel,7,9,"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment [was] white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne [was like] the fiery flame, [and] his wheels [as] burning fire."
Daniel,7,10,"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."
Daniel,7,11,I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld [even] till the

Daniel,7,13,"I saw in the night visions, and, behold, [one] like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him."
Daniel,7,14,"And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion [is] an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed. Daniel’s Visions Interpreted"
Daniel,7,15,"I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of [my] body, and the visions of my head troubled me."
Daniel,7,16,"I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and"
Daniel,7,17,"These great beasts, which are four, [are] four kings,"
Daniel,7,18,"But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever."
Daniel,7,19,"Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth [were of] iron, and his nails [of] brass; [which] devoured, brake in pieces, and"
Daniel,7,20,"And of the ten horns that [were] in his head, and [of] the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even [of] that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake"

Daniel,7,22,"Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from"
Daniel,7,24,And the ten horns out of this kingdom [are] ten kings [that] shall arise: and another shall rise after them;

Daniel,7,27,"And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him."
Daniel,7,28,"Hitherto [is] the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart."
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, [even unto] me Daniel,"
Daniel,8,2,"And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I [was] at Shushan [in] the palace, which [is] in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision,"
Daniel,8,3,"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had [two] horns: and the [two] horns [were] high; but one [was] higher than"
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither [was there any] that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great."
Daniel,8,5,"And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and"

Daniel,8,8,"Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and"
Daniel,8,10,"And it waxed great, [even] to the host of heaven;"
Daniel,8,11,"Yea, he magnified [himself] even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily [sacrifice] was taken away,"
Daniel,8,12,"And an host was given [him] against the daily [sacrifice] by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and"

Daniel,8,24,"And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people."
Daniel,8,25,"And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify [himself] in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand."
Daniel,8,26,And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told [is] true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it [shall be] for many days.
Daniel,8,27,"And I Daniel fainted, and was sick [certain] days; afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood [it]."

Daniel,9,7,"O Lord, righteousness [belongeth] unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, [that are] near, and [that are] far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they"

Daniel,9,27,"And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make [it] desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate."
Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing [was] true, but the time appointed [was] long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision."
Daniel,10,2,In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
Daniel,10,3,"I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh"
Daniel,10,4,"And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which [is] Hiddekel;"

Daniel,11,5,"And the king of the south shall be strong, and [one] of his princes; and he shall be strong above him,"
Daniel,11,6,"And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her"

Daniel,11,13,"For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches."
Daniel,11,14,And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy

Daniel,11,18,"After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause [it] to turn"
Daniel,11,19,"Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found."

Daniel,11,27,"And both these kings’ hearts [shall be] to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end [shall be] at the time"
Daniel,11,28,"Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart [shall be] against the holy covenant; and he shall do [exploits], and return to his own land."
Daniel,11,29,"At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter."
Daniel,11,30,"For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with"
Daniel,11,31,"And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily [sacrifice], and they shall place the abomination"

Daniel,11,36,"And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the"
Daniel,11,37,"Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above"

Daniel,11,40,"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he"
Daniel,11,41,"He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many [countries] shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, [even] Edom,"
Daniel,11,42,He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the

Daniel,11,45,"And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him."
Daniel,12,1,"And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation [even] to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book."
Daniel,12,2,"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some"
Daniel,12,3,And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the

Hosea,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel."
Hosea,1,2,"The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom,"
Hosea,1,3,"So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived,"
Hosea,1,4,"And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little [while], and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the"
Hosea,1,5,"And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel."
Hosea,1,6,"And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And [God] said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah:"
Hosea,1,7,"But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen."
Hosea,1,8,"Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son."
Hosea,1,9,"Then said [God], Call his name Loammi: for ye [are] not my people, and I will not be your [God]."
Hosea,1,10,"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye [are] not my people, [there] it shall be said unto them, [Ye are] the sons of the living God."
Hosea,1,11,"Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great [shall be] the day of Jezreel."
Hosea,2,1,"Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah."
Hosea,2,2,"Plead with your mother, plead: for she [is] not my wife, neither [am] I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;"
Hosea,2,3,"Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst."
Hosea,2,4,And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they [be] the children of whoredoms.
Hosea,2,5,"For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give [me] my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink."
Hosea,2,6,"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths."
Hosea,2,7,"And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find [them]: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then [was it] better with me than now."
Hosea,2,8,"For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, [which] they prepared for Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax [given] to cover her nakedness."
Hosea,2,10,"And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand."
Hosea,2,11,"I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts."
Hosea,2,12,"And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These [are] my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them."
Hosea,2,13,"And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD. God’s Mercy to Israel"
Hosea,2,14,"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her."
Hosea,2,15,"And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, [that] thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali."
Hosea,2,17,"For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name."
Hosea,2,18,"And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and [with] the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely."
Hosea,2,19,"And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies."
Hosea,2,20,I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.
Hosea,2,21,"And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;"
Hosea,2,22,"And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel."
Hosea,2,23,"And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to [them which were] not my people, Thou [art] my people; and they shall say, [Thou art] my God."
Hosea,3,1,"Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of [her] friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love"
Hosea,3,2,"So I bought her to me for fifteen [pieces] of silver, and [for] an homer of barley, and"
Hosea,3,3,"And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play"
Hosea,3,4,"For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without"
Hosea,3,5,"Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because [there is] no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land."
Hosea,4,2,"By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood."
Hosea,4,3,"Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away."
Hosea,4,4,"Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people [are] as they that strive with the priest."
Hosea,4,5,"Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother."
Hosea,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children."
Hosea,4,7,"As they were increased, so they sinned against me: [therefore] will I change their glory into shame."
Hosea,4,8,"They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity."
Hosea,4,9,"And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings."
Hosea,4,10,"For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD."
Hosea,4,11,Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
Hosea,4,12,"My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused [them] to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God."
Hosea,4,13,"They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof [is] good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people [that] doth not understand shall fall."
Hosea,4,15,"Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, [yet] let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth."
Hosea,4,16,For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim [is] joined to idols: let him alone.
Hosea,4,18,"Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers [with] shame do love, Give ye."
Hosea,4,19,"The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices."
Hosea,5,1,"Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment [is] toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor."
Hosea,5,2,"And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I [have been] a rebuker of them all."
Hosea,5,3,"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, [and] Israel is defiled."
Hosea,5,4,"They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms [is] in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD."
Hosea,5,5,And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.
Hosea,5,6,They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find [him]; he hath withdrawn himself from them.
Hosea,5,7,They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.
Hosea,5,8,"Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, [and] the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud [at] Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin."
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: [therefore] I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim [is] oppressed [and] broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment."
Hosea,5,12,"Therefore [will] I [be] unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness."
Hosea,5,13,"When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound."
Hosea,5,14,"For I [will be] unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, [even] I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue [him]."
Hosea,5,15,"I will go [and] return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early."
Hosea,6,1,"Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up."
Hosea,6,2,"After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight."

Hosea,6,4,"O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness [is] as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away."

Hosea,7,1,"When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, [and] the troop of robbers spoileth without."

Hosea,7,4,"They [are] all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, [who] ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened."
Hosea,7,5,In the day of our king the princes have made [him] sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
Hosea,7,6,"For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire."
Hosea,7,7,"They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: [there is] none among them that calleth unto me."

Hosea,7,10,"And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this."
Hosea,7,11,"Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria."

Hosea,8,3,Israel hath cast off [the thing that is] good: the enemy shall pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,"They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew [it] not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off."
Hosea,8,5,"Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast [thee] off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long [will it be] ere they attain to innocency?"

Hosea,9,5,"What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?"

Hosea,9,7,"The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know [it]: the prophet [is] a fool, the spiritual man [is] mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred."
Hosea,9,8,"The watchman of Ephraim [was] with my God: [but] the prophet [is] a snare of a fowler in all his ways, [and] hatred in the house of his God."
Hosea,9,9,"They have deeply corrupted [themselves], as in the days of Gibeah: [therefore] he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins."

Hosea,10,3,"For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?"

Jonah,1,10,"Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them. Jonah Cast into the Sea"
Jonah,1,11,"Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea"
Jonah,1,12,"And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest [is] upon you."
Jonah,1,13,"Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring [it] to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought,"
Jonah,1,14,"Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee."
Jonah,1,15,"So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging."
Jonah,1,16,"Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows."

Jonah,2,1,"Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly,"
Jonah,2,2,"And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, [and] thou heardest my voice."
Jonah,2,3,"For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me."
Jonah,2,4,"Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple."

Jonah,2,7,"When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple."
Jonah,2,8,They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
Jonah,2,9,But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay [that] that I have vowed. Salvation [is] of the LORD.

Jonah,3,4,"And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown."
Jonah,3,5,"So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest"

Jonah,3,9,"Who can tell [if] God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?"
Jonah,3,10,"And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did [it] not."
Jonah,4,1,"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry."
Jonah,4,2,"And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, [was] not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou [art] a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great"
Jonah,4,3,"Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from"
Jonah,4,4,"Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?"
Jonah,4,5,"So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and"

Micah,1,6,"Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, [and] as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof."
Micah,1,7,"And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered [it] of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot. Weeping and Mourning"

Micah,1,10,"Declare ye [it] not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust."
Micah,1,11,"Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing."

Micah,3,10,"They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity."

Nahum,3,12,"All thy strong holds [shall be like] fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater."
Nahum,3,13,"Behold, thy people in the midst of thee [are] women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars."
Nahum,3,14,"Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln."
Nahum,3,15,"There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts."
Nahum,3,16,"Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away."
Nahum,3,17,"Thy crowned [are] as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, [but] when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they [are]."
Nahum,3,18,"Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell [in the dust]: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth [them]. 19[There is] no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?"
Habakkuk,1,1,The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
Habakkuk,1,2,"O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! [even] cry out unto thee [of] violence, and thou wilt not save!"
Habakkuk,1,3,"Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause [me] to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence [are] before me: and there are [that] raise up strife and contention."
Habakkuk,1,4,"Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth. The LORD’s Answer"
Habakkuk,1,5,"Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for [I] will work a work in your days, [which] ye will not believe, though it be told [you]."
Habakkuk,1,6,"For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, [that] bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces [that are] not theirs."
Habakkuk,1,7,They [are] terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.
Habakkuk,1,8,"Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle [that] hasteth to eat."
Habakkuk,1,9,"They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up [as] the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand."
Habakkuk,1,10,"And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it."
Habakkuk,1,11,"Then shall [his] mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, [imputing] this his power unto his god. Habakkuk’s Second Complaint (Psalm 11:1–7) 12[Art] thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction. 13[Thou art] of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, [and] holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth [the man that is] more righteous than he?"
Habakkuk,1,14,"And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, [that have] no ruler over them?"
Habakkuk,1,15,"They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad."
Habakkuk,1,16,"Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion [is] fat, and their meat plenteous."
Habakkuk,1,17,"Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?"
Habakkuk,2,1,"I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved."
Habakkuk,2,2,"And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make [it] plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it."
Habakkuk,2,3,"For the vision [is] yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry."
Habakkuk,2,4,"Behold, his soul [which] is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith."
Habakkuk,2,5,"Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, [he is] a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and [is] as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people: Woe to the Chaldeans"
Habakkuk,2,6,"Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth [that which is] not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!"
Habakkuk,2,7,"Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?"
Habakkuk,2,8,"Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men’s blood, and [for] the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein."
Habakkuk,2,9,"Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!"
Habakkuk,2,10,"Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned [against] thy soul."
Habakkuk,2,11,"For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it."
Habakkuk,2,12,"Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!"
Habakkuk,2,13,"Behold, [is it] not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?"
Habakkuk,2,14,"For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea."
Habakkuk,2,15,"Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to [him], and makest [him] drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!"
Habakkuk,2,16,"Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD’S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing [shall be] on thy glory."
Habakkuk,2,17,"For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, [which] made them afraid, because of men’s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein."
Habakkuk,2,18,"What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?"
Habakkuk,2,19,"Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it [is] laid over with gold and silver, and [there is] no breath at all in the midst of it."
Habakkuk,2,20,But the LORD [is] in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.
Habakkuk,3,1,A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
Habakkuk,3,2,"O LORD, I have heard thy speech, [and] was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy."
Habakkuk,3,3,"God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise."
Habakkuk,3,4,And [his] brightness was as the light; he had horns [coming] out of his hand: and there [was] the hiding of his power.
Habakkuk,3,5,"Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet."
Habakkuk,3,6,"He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways [are] everlasting."
Habakkuk,3,7,I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: [and] the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
Habakkuk,3,8,"Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? [was] thine anger against the rivers? [was] thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses [and] thy chariots of salvation?"
Habakkuk,3,9,"Thy bow was made quite naked, [according] to the oaths of the tribes, [even thy] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers."
Habakkuk,3,10,"The mountains saw thee, [and] they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, [and] lifted up his hands on high."
Habakkuk,3,11,"The sun [and] moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, [and] at the shining of thy glittering spear."
Habakkuk,3,12,"Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger."
Habakkuk,3,13,"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, [even] for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah."
Habakkuk,3,14,Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing [was] as to devour the poor secretly.
Habakkuk,3,15,"Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, [through] the heap of great waters."
Habakkuk,3,16,"When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops. Habakkuk Rejoices"
Habakkuk,3,17,"Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither [shall] fruit [be] in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and [there shall be] no herd in the stalls:"
Habakkuk,3,18,"Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation."
Habakkuk,3,19,"The LORD God [is] my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds’ [feet], and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments."

Zephaniah,1,11,"Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off."
Zephaniah,1,12,"And it shall come to pass at that time, [that] I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil."
Zephaniah,1,13,"Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit [them]; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof."
Zephaniah,1,14,"The great day of the LORD [is] near, [it is] near, and hasteth greatly, [even] the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly."
Zephaniah,1,15,"That day [is] a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,"
Zephaniah,1,16,"A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers."
Zephaniah,1,17,"And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung."
Zephaniah,1,18,Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD’S wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.
Zephaniah,2,1,"Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;"

Zephaniah,2,4,"For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up."
Zephaniah,2,5,"Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD [is] against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant."
Zephaniah,2,6,"And the sea coast shall be dwellings [and] cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks."
Zephaniah,2,7,"And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity. Judgment on Moab and Ammon (Isaiah 16:1–14; Jeremiah 48:1–47)"
Zephaniah,2,8,"I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified [themselves] against their border."
Zephaniah,2,9,"Therefore [as] I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, [even] the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them."

Zephaniah,2,14,"And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; [their] voice shall sing in the windows; desolation [shall be] in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work."
Zephaniah,2,15,"This [is] the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I [am], and [there is] none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, [and] wag his hand."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!"
Zephaniah,3,2,She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.
Zephaniah,3,3,Her princes within her [are] roaring lions; her judges [are] evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.
Zephaniah,3,4,"Her prophets [are] light [and] treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law."

Zephaniah,3,6,"I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant."
Zephaniah,3,7,"I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, [and] corrupted all their doings."
Zephaniah,3,8,"Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination [is] to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, [even] all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. A Faithful Remnant"
Zephaniah,3,9,"For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent."
Zephaniah,3,10,"From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, [even] the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering."
Zephaniah,3,11,"In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain."
Zephaniah,3,12,"I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD."
Zephaniah,3,13,"The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make [them] afraid. Israel’s Restoration"
Zephaniah,3,14,"Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem."
Zephaniah,3,15,"The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, [even] the LORD, [is] in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more."
Zephaniah,3,16,"In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: [and to] Zion, Let not thine hands be slack."

Zephaniah,3,19,"Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame."
Zephaniah,3,20,"At that time will I bring you [again], even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD."

Zechariah,9,17,"For how great [is] his goodness, and how great [is] his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids."
Zechariah,10,1,"Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; [so] the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field."
Zechariah,10,2,"For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because [there was] no shepherd."
Zechariah,10,3,"Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle."
Zechariah,10,4,"Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together."
Zechariah,10,5,"And they shall be as mighty [men], which tread down [their enemies] in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD [is] with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded."

Zechariah,10,9,"And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again."
Zechariah,10,10,"I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and [place] shall not be found for them."
Zechariah,10,11,"And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away."
Zechariah,10,12,"And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD."
Zechariah,11,1,"Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars."
Zechariah,11,2,"Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down. 3[There is] a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled."
Zechariah,11,4,Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;
Zechariah,11,5,"Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed [be] the LORD; for I am rich: and their own"

Zechariah,11,7,"And I will feed the flock of slaughter, [even] you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves;"
Zechariah,11,8,Three shepherds also I cut

Zechariah,11,13,"And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty"
Zechariah,11,14,"Then I cut asunder mine other staff, [even] Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel."
Zechariah,11,15,"And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd."
Zechariah,11,16,"For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, [which] shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces."
Zechariah,11,17,"Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword [shall be] upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened."

Zechariah,12,6,"In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left:"
Zechariah,12,7,"The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of"

John,5,16,"And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these"
John,5,17,"But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work."
John,5,18,"Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God."
John,5,19,"Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son"

John,5,30,"I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. Testimonies about Jesus"
John,5,31,"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true."
John,5,32,There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.

John,6,17,"And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them."
John,6,18,And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
John,6,19,"So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they"

John,9,15,"Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see."
John,9,16,"Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among"

John,9,22,"These [words] spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already,"
John,9,23,"Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him."
John,9,24,"Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know"
John,9,25,"He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner [or no], I know not: one"

John,10,5,"And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee"
John,10,6,This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.

John,10,19,There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.

Romans,2,26,Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the
Romans,2,27,"And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?"
Romans,2,28,"For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither [is that] circumcision, which is outward in the"
Romans,2,29,"But he [is] a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision [is that] of the heart, in the spirit, [and] not in the letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God."
Romans,3,1,What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit [is there] of circumcision?
Romans,3,2,Much every way:
Romans,3,3,For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
Romans,3,4,"God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged."
Romans,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Is] God"
Romans,3,6,God forbid: for then how shall God judge the

Romans,3,8,"And not [rather], (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just. There Is No One Righteous (Psalm 14:1–7; Psalm 53:1–6; Isaiah 59:1–17)"
Romans,3,9,"What then? are we better [than they]? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;"
Romans,3,10,"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"
Romans,3,11,"There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God."
Romans,3,12,"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one."
Romans,3,13,Their throat [is] an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips:
Romans,3,14,Whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness:
Romans,3,15,Their feet [are] swift to shed blood:
Romans,3,16,Destruction and misery [are] in their ways:
Romans,3,17,And the way of peace have they not known:
Romans,3,18,There is no fear of God before their eyes.
Romans,3,19,"Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that"
Romans,3,20,Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin. Righteousness through Faith in Christ (Philippians 3:1–11)
Romans,3,21,"But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the"
Romans,3,22,Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all
Romans,3,23,"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"
Romans,3,24,Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
Romans,3,25,"Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission"
Romans,3,26,"To declare, [I say], at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus."
Romans,3,27,Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
Romans,3,28,Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. 29[Is he] the
Romans,3,30,"Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith."
Romans,3,31,"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."

Romans,4,13,"For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed,"
Romans,4,14,"For if they which are of the law [be] heirs,"
Romans,4,15,"Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, [there is] no transgression."
Romans,4,16,"Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, 17(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, [even] God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they"
Romans,4,18,"Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations;"
Romans,4,19,"And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of"
Romans,4,20,"He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith,"
Romans,4,21,"And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to"
Romans,4,22,And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
Romans,4,23,Now it was not written for his

Romans,4,25,"Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification."
Romans,5,1,"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:"
Romans,5,2,"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
Romans,5,3,"And not only [so], but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;"
Romans,5,4,And
Romans,5,5,And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. Christ’s Sacrifice for the Ungodly (John 3:1–21)
Romans,5,6,"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly."

Romans,5,11,"And not only [so], but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. Death in Adam, Life in Christ (Genesis 3:1–7)"
Romans,5,12,"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 13(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when"
Romans,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come."
Romans,5,15,"But not as the offence, so also [is] the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded"
Romans,5,16,"And not as [it was] by one that sinned, [so is] the gift: for the judgment [was] by one"
Romans,5,17,"For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)"
Romans,5,18,Therefore as by the offence of one [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation; even so by the
Romans,5,19,"For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."
Romans,5,20,"Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much"
Romans,5,21,"That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans,6,1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
Romans,6,2,"God forbid. How shall we,"
Romans,6,3,"Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into"
Romans,6,4,"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk"

Romans,6,6,"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [him], that the"
Romans,6,7,For he that is dead is freed from sin.

Romans,6,9,Knowing that Christ being

Romans,6,11,"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans,6,12,"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof."
Romans,6,13,"Neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God."
Romans,6,14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. The Wages of Sin"
Romans,6,15,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."
Romans,6,16,"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey;"
Romans,6,17,"But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you."
Romans,6,18,"Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness."
Romans,6,19,I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
Romans,6,20,"For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness."
Romans,6,21,What fruit had ye then in
Romans,6,22,"But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end"
Romans,6,23,For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Romans,7,1,"Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over"
Romans,7,2,"For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to [her] husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of [her] husband."
Romans,7,3,"So then if, while [her] husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man."
Romans,7,4,"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, [even] to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto"

Romans,7,13,"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."
Romans,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."
Romans,7,15,For that which I do I allow
Romans,7,16,"If then I do that which I would not,"
Romans,7,17,"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in"
Romans,7,18,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with"
Romans,7,19,For the good that I would I do not: but the
Romans,7,20,"Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
Romans,7,21,"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me."
Romans,7,22,For I delight in the law of

Romans,7,24,O wretched man that
Romans,7,25,I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.

Romans,8,7,"Because the carnal mind [is] enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed"
Romans,8,8,So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

Romans,8,16,"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:"
Romans,8,17,"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with [him], that we may be also glorified together. Future Glory (2 Corinthians 5:1–10)"
Romans,8,18,For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the glory

Romans,8,26,Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought:
Romans,8,27,"And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God. God Works in All Things (Ephesians 1:3–14)"
Romans,8,28,"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the"
Romans,8,29,"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate [to be]"
Romans,8,30,"Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
Romans,8,31,"What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us, who [can be] against us?"
Romans,8,32,"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us"
Romans,8,33,Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? [It is] God that justifieth.
Romans,8,34,"Who [is] he that condemneth? [It is] Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. More than Conquerors (Psalm 44:1–26)"
Romans,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? [shall] tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
Romans,8,36,"As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
Romans,8,37,"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."
Romans,8,38,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,"
Romans,8,39,"Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

Romans,10,12,For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the
Romans,10,13,For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Romans,10,14,How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him
Romans,10,15,"And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!"
Romans,10,16,"But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?"

Romans,10,18,"But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world."

Romans,11,24,"For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural [branches], be graffed into their own olive tree? All Israel Will Be Saved"
Romans,11,25,"For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in."
Romans,11,26,"And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:"

Romans,12,1,"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,"
Romans,12,2,"And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what [is] that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."

Romans,14,11,"For it is written, [As] I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God."
Romans,14,12,So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. The Law of Love (Ezekiel 14:1–11; 1 Corinthians 8:1–13)

1 Corinthians,1,16,"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other."
1 Corinthians,1,17,"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. The Message of the Cross"
1 Corinthians,1,18,For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
1 Corinthians,1,19,"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
1 Corinthians,1,20,Where [is] the wise? where [is] the scribe? where [is] the disputer of this world? hath not God made

1 Corinthians,2,10,"But God hath revealed [them] unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep"
1 Corinthians,2,11,"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?"
1 Corinthians,2,12,"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given"
1 Corinthians,2,13,"Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
1 Corinthians,2,14,But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him:
1 Corinthians,2,15,But he that is spiritual judgeth
1 Corinthians,2,16,"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,1,"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, [even] as unto babes"
1 Corinthians,3,2,"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able [to bear it],"

1 Corinthians,3,5,"Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to"
1 Corinthians,3,6,"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase."
1 Corinthians,3,7,So then neither is he that

1 Corinthians,3,10,"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon."
1 Corinthians,3,11,"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,12,Now if any man build
1 Corinthians,3,13,"Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try"
1 Corinthians,3,14,"If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall"

1 Corinthians,3,16,"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"
1 Corinthians,3,17,"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are."
1 Corinthians,3,18,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
1 Corinthians,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own"
1 Corinthians,3,20,"And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
1 Corinthians,3,21,Therefore
1 Corinthians,3,22,"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world,"
1 Corinthians,3,23,And ye are Christ’s; and Christ [is] God’s.
1 Corinthians,4,1,"Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God."
1 Corinthians,4,2,"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."
1 Corinthians,4,3,But with me it is a very small thing
1 Corinthians,4,4,For I know
1 Corinthians,4,5,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God."
1 Corinthians,4,6,"And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and [to] Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed"
1 Corinthians,4,7,"For who maketh thee to differ [from another]? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive [it], why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received [it]?"
1 Corinthians,4,8,"Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did"
1 Corinthians,4,9,"For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men."

1 Corinthians,4,14,"I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn [you]."
1 Corinthians,4,15,"For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet [have ye] not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten"

1 Corinthians,5,2,"And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you."
1 Corinthians,5,3,"For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present,"

1 Corinthians,5,9,I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
1 Corinthians,5,10,"Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs"

1 Corinthians,5,12,For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye

1 Corinthians,7,5,"Defraud ye not one the other, except [it be] with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again,"
1 Corinthians,7,6,"But I speak this by permission, [and] not of"
1 Corinthians,7,7,"For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that."
1 Corinthians,7,8,"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I."
1 Corinthians,7,9,"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"And unto the married I command, [yet] not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from [her]"
1 Corinthians,7,11,"But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to [her] husband: and let not the husband put away [his] wife."
1 Corinthians,7,12,"But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased"
1 Corinthians,7,13,And the woman which hath an husband that believeth
1 Corinthians,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children"
1 Corinthians,7,15,"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is"
1 Corinthians,7,16,"For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save [thy] husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save [thy] wife? Live Your Calling"
1 Corinthians,7,17,"But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so"
1 Corinthians,7,18,Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is
1 Corinthians,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision"
1 Corinthians,7,20,Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
1 Corinthians,7,21,"Art thou called [being] a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use [it] rather."
1 Corinthians,7,22,"For he that is called in the Lord, [being] a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is"
1 Corinthians,7,23,Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
1 Corinthians,7,24,"Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God. The Unmarried and Widowed"
1 Corinthians,7,25,"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that"
1 Corinthians,7,26,I suppose therefore that this is good for the present
1 Corinthians,7,27,Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be
1 Corinthians,7,28,"But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare"
1 Corinthians,7,29,"But this I say, brethren, the time [is] short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as"
1 Corinthians,7,30,"And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as"
1 Corinthians,7,31,"And they that use this world, as not abusing [it]: for the fashion of this world passeth away."
1 Corinthians,7,32,But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to
1 Corinthians,7,33,But he that is married careth for the things that are of the
1 Corinthians,7,34,"There is difference [also] between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit:"
1 Corinthians,7,35,"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of"
1 Corinthians,7,37,"Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath"
1 Corinthians,7,38,So then he that giveth [her] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth [her] not in marriage doeth better.
1 Corinthians,7,39,"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at"
1 Corinthians,7,40,"But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God."
1 Corinthians,8,1,"Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth"
1 Corinthians,8,2,"And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as"
1 Corinthians,8,3,"But if any man love God, the same is known of him."
1 Corinthians,8,4,"As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know"
1 Corinthians,8,5,For though there

1 Corinthians,8,7,Howbeit [there is] not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this
1 Corinthians,8,8,"But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the"
1 Corinthians,8,9,But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that
1 Corinthians,8,10,"For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;"
1 Corinthians,8,11,"And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
1 Corinthians,8,12,But when ye sin
1 Corinthians,8,13,"Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend."
1 Corinthians,9,1,Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the
1 Corinthians,9,2,"If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,9,3,"Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,"
1 Corinthians,9,4,Have we not power to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians,9,5,"Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and [as] the brethren of the Lord,"
1 Corinthians,9,6,"Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?"
1 Corinthians,9,7,"Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"
1 Corinthians,9,8,Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
1 Corinthians,9,9,"For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?"
1 Corinthians,9,10,"Or saith he [it] altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, [this] is written: that he that"
1 Corinthians,9,11,If
1 Corinthians,9,12,"If others be partakers of [this] power over you, [are] not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this"
1 Corinthians,9,13,Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live [of the things] of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are
1 Corinthians,9,14,Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
1 Corinthians,9,15,"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done"
1 Corinthians,9,16,"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto"
1 Corinthians,9,17,"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will,"
1 Corinthians,9,18,"What is my reward then? [Verily] that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. Paul the Servant to All"
1 Corinthians,9,19,"For though I be free from all [men], yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the"
1 Corinthians,9,20,"And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the"
1 Corinthians,9,21,"To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them"
1 Corinthians,9,22,"To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all"
1 Corinthians,9,23,"And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with [you]. Run Your Race to Win"
1 Corinthians,9,24,"Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may"
1 Corinthians,9,25,And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they [do it] to
1 Corinthians,9,26,"I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I,"
1 Corinthians,9,27,"But I keep under my body, and bring [it] into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."
1 Corinthians,10,1,"Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the"
1 Corinthians,10,2,And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
1 Corinthians,10,3,And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
1 Corinthians,10,4,And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of
1 Corinthians,10,5,But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1 Corinthians,10,6,"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also"
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Neither be ye idolaters, as [were] some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat"
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and"
1 Corinthians,10,9,"Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted,"
1 Corinthians,10,10,"Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were"
1 Corinthians,10,11,Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are
1 Corinthians,10,12,Wherefore let him that
1 Corinthians,10,13,"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it]. Flee from Idolatry (Exodus 20:22–26)"
1 Corinthians,10,14,"Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
1 Corinthians,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which"
1 Corinthians,10,17,"For we [being] many are one bread, [and]"
1 Corinthians,10,18,Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which

1 Corinthians,10,20,"But [I say], that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils."
1 Corinthians,10,21,"Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table,"
1 Corinthians,10,22,Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? All to God’s Glory (1 Peter 4:1–11)
1 Corinthians,10,23,"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all"
1 Corinthians,10,24,"Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s [wealth]."
1 Corinthians,10,25,Whatsoever is sold

1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake:"
1 Corinthians,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."
1 Corinthians,10,32,Give none
1 Corinthians,10,33,"Even as I please all [men] in all [things], not seeking mine own profit, but the [profit] of many, that they may be saved."
1 Corinthians,11,1,"Be ye followers of me, even as I also [am] of Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,2,"Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered"

1 Corinthians,11,7,"For a man indeed ought not to cover [his] head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of"
1 Corinthians,11,8,For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the

1 Corinthians,11,10,For this cause
1 Corinthians,11,11,Nevertheless neither is the

1 Corinthians,11,17,"Now in this that I declare [unto you] I praise [you] not, that ye come together not for the better,"
1 Corinthians,11,18,"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions"
1 Corinthians,11,19,"For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are"
1 Corinthians,11,20,"When ye come together therefore into one place, [this]"
1 Corinthians,11,21,For in eating every one taketh before [other] his own supper: and
1 Corinthians,11,22,"What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise [you] not."
1 Corinthians,11,23,"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same]"
1 Corinthians,11,24,"And when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said,"
1 Corinthians,11,25,"After the same manner also [he took] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my"
1 Corinthians,11,26,"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come."
1 Corinthians,11,27,"Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty"
1 Corinthians,11,28,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread,"
1 Corinthians,11,29,"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation"
1 Corinthians,11,30,"For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you,"
1 Corinthians,11,31,"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brethren, I would not have you ignorant."
1 Corinthians,12,2,Ye know that ye were
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and [that] no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"And there are differences of administrations,"
1 Corinthians,12,6,"And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all"
1 Corinthians,12,7,But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
1 Corinthians,12,8,For to one is given by
1 Corinthians,12,9,To another faith
1 Corinthians,12,10,To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another [divers] kinds of tongues;
1 Corinthians,12,11,"But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. The Body of Christ"
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many,"
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am"
1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye,"
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If the whole body [were] an eye, where [were]"
1 Corinthians,12,18,But now hath God set the
1 Corinthians,12,19,"And if they were all one member,"
1 Corinthians,12,20,"But now [are they] many members, yet but one body."
1 Corinthians,12,21,"And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
1 Corinthians,12,22,"Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:"
1 Corinthians,12,23,"And those [members] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more"
1 Corinthians,12,24,"For our comely [parts] have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that"
1 Corinthians,12,25,That there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should
1 Corinthians,12,26,"And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. The Greater Gifts"
1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. 29[Are] all apostles? [are]"
1 Corinthians,12,30,Have all the gifts of healing? do all
1 Corinthians,12,31,But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
1 Corinthians,13,1,"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become [as]"
1 Corinthians,13,2,"And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have"
1 Corinthians,13,3,"And though I bestow all my goods to feed [the poor], and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Charity suffereth long, [and] is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,"
1 Corinthians,13,5,"Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;"
1 Corinthians,13,6,"Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;"
1 Corinthians,13,7,"Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Charity never faileth: but whether [there be] prophecies, they shall fail; whether [there be] tongues,"
1 Corinthians,13,9,"For we know in part, and we"
1 Corinthians,13,10,"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done"
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when"
1 Corinthians,13,12,"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face"
1 Corinthians,13,13,"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these [is] charity."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Follow after charity, and desire spiritual [gifts], but rather that ye may prophesy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For he that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth [him];"
1 Corinthians,14,3,But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men [to]
1 Corinthians,14,4,He that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue edifieth himself;
1 Corinthians,14,5,"I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater [is] he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how"
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds"
1 Corinthians,14,11,"Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh [shall be] a"
1 Corinthians,14,12,"Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual [gifts], seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church."
1 Corinthians,14,13,Wherefore let him that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians,14,14,For if I pray
1 Corinthians,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will"
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified."
1 Corinthians,14,18,"I thank my God,"
1 Corinthians,14,19,"Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that [by my voice] I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an [unknown] tongue."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding"
1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the law it is written, With [men of] other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this"
1 Corinthians,14,22,"Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying [serveth] not for them that"
1 Corinthians,14,23,"If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in [those that are] unlearned, or unbelievers, will"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or [one]"
1 Corinthians,14,25,"And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on [his] face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth. Orderly Worship"
1 Corinthians,14,26,"How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine,"
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If any man speak in an [unknown] tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most [by] three, and [that] by course;"
1 Corinthians,14,28,"But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him"
1 Corinthians,14,29,"Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge."
1 Corinthians,14,30,If [any
1 Corinthians,14,31,For ye may all prophesy one
1 Corinthians,14,32,And the spirits of the prophets are subject to
1 Corinthians,14,33,"For God is not [the author] of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints."
1 Corinthians,14,34,Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but [they
1 Corinthians,14,35,"And if they will learn any thing, let"
1 Corinthians,14,36,What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I"
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues."
1 Corinthians,14,40,Let all things be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have"
1 Corinthians,15,2,"By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins"
1 Corinthians,15,4,"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according"
1 Corinthians,15,5,"And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:"
1 Corinthians,15,6,"After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some"
1 Corinthians,15,7,"After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles."
1 Corinthians,15,8,And last of all he was
1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet"
1 Corinthians,15,10,But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which [was bestowed] upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly
1 Corinthians,15,11,"Therefore whether [it were] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed. The Resurrection of the Dead"
1 Corinthians,15,12,"Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:"
1 Corinthians,15,14,And
1 Corinthians,15,15,"Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he"
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:"
1 Corinthians,15,17,And
1 Corinthians,15,18,Then they also which are fallen
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. The Order of Resurrection"
1 Corinthians,15,20,"But now is Christ risen from the dead, [and] become the firstfruits of them that slept."
1 Corinthians,15,21,For since by
1 Corinthians,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, even so"
1 Corinthians,15,23,But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they
1 Corinthians,15,24,"Then [cometh] the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom"

1 Corinthians,15,42,So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:

2 Corinthians,3,7,"But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory]"
2 Corinthians,3,8,How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
2 Corinthians,3,9,"For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in"
2 Corinthians,3,10,"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory"
2 Corinthians,3,11,"For if that which is done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious."
2 Corinthians,3,12,"Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:"
2 Corinthians,3,13,"And not as Moses, [which] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is"

2 Corinthians,3,18,"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord."
2 Corinthians,4,1,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;"
2 Corinthians,4,2,"But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God."
2 Corinthians,4,3,"But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:"
2 Corinthians,4,4,"In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of"

2 Corinthians,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. 8[We are] troubled on every side, yet not distressed; [we are] perplexed, but not in despair;"

2 Corinthians,4,16,"For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward [man] is renewed"
2 Corinthians,4,17,"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding"
2 Corinthians,4,18,"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen [are] temporal; but the things which are not seen [are] eternal."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God,"
2 Corinthians,5,2,"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be"
2 Corinthians,5,3,If so be that being clothed we shall not be found

2 Corinthians,5,19,"To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech [you] by us: we pray [you] in"

2 Corinthians,6,11,"O [ye] Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged."
2 Corinthians,6,12,"Ye are not straitened in us,"
2 Corinthians,6,13,"Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto [my] children,) be ye also enlarged. Do Not Be Unequally Yoked"
2 Corinthians,6,14,Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with
2 Corinthians,6,15,And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
2 Corinthians,6,16,"And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
2 Corinthians,6,17,"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean [thing]; and I will receive you,"
2 Corinthians,6,18,"And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."

2 Corinthians,7,4,"Great [is] my boldness of speech toward you, great [is] my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation."
2 Corinthians,7,5,"For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side;"
2 Corinthians,7,6,"Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast"

2 Corinthians,7,9,"Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for"
2 Corinthians,7,10,For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh

Galatians,2,11,"But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed."
Galatians,2,12,"For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come,"
Galatians,2,13,And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
Galatians,2,14,"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before [them] all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"
Galatians,2,15,"We [who are] Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,"

Galatians,3,19,"Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come"

Galatians,4,27,"For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband."
Galatians,4,28,"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise."
Galatians,4,29,"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, even so [it is] now."
Galatians,4,30,Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
Galatians,4,31,"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."
Galatians,5,1,"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
Galatians,5,2,"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."

Hebrews,5,11,"Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing."
Hebrews,5,12,"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which [be] the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat."
Hebrews,5,13,For every one that useth milk [is] unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
Hebrews,5,14,"But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, [even] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."

Hebrews,7,20,"And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]: 21(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)"
Hebrews,7,22,By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
Hebrews,7,23,"And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:"
Hebrews,7,24,"But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood."
Hebrews,7,25,"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"For such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and"
Hebrews,7,27,"Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice,"
Hebrews,7,28,"For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, [maketh] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore."

Hebrews,8,6,"But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second."
Hebrews,8,8,"For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:"
Hebrews,8,9,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord."
Hebrews,8,10,"For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:"
Hebrews,8,11,"And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest."
Hebrews,8,12,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."
Hebrews,8,13,"In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] ready to vanish away."
Hebrews,9,1,"Then verily the first [covenant] had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary."
Hebrews,9,2,"For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein [was] the candlestick, and the table, and the"
Hebrews,9,3,"And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called"

Hebrews,9,20,"Saying, This [is] the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined"
Hebrews,9,21,"Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry."
Hebrews,9,22,And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. 23[It was] therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these;

Hebrews,9,27,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the"
Hebrews,9,28,So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
Hebrews,10,1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto"
Hebrews,10,2,For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once

Hebrews,10,4,For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:"
Hebrews,10,6,In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
Hebrews,10,7,"Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God."
Hebrews,10,8,"Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin thou wouldest"
Hebrews,10,9,"Then said he, Lo, I come to do"

Hebrews,10,11,"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can"
Hebrews,10,12,"But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on"
Hebrews,10,13,From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
Hebrews,10,14,"For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. 15[Whereof] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,"
Hebrews,10,16,"This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;"
Hebrews,10,17,And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

Hebrews,10,38,"Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."
Hebrews,10,39,But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
Hebrews,11,1,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
Hebrews,11,2,For by it the elders obtained a good report.
Hebrews,11,3,"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. The Faith of Abel, Enoch, Noah (Genesis 4–9)"
