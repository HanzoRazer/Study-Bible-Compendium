Ruth,2,9,"Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them; have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when"
Ruth,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed down to the ground, and said unto him: ‘Why have I found favour in thy"
Ruth,2,11,"And Boaz answered and said unto her: ‘It hath fully been told me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity,"
Ruth,2,12,"The LORD recompense thy work, and be thy reward complete from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take"
Ruth,2,13,"Then she said: ‘Let me find favour in thy sight, my LORD; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.’"
Ruth,2,14,"And Boaz said unto her at meal-time: ‘Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.’ And she sat beside the reapers; and they reached her parched corn, and she did eat and was"
Ruth,2,15,"And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men,"
Ruth,2,16,"And also pull out some for her of purpose from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.’"
Ruth,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about"
Ruth,2,18,"And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was satisfied."
Ruth,2,19,And her mother-in-law said unto her: ‘Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.’ And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had

Ruth,2,22,"And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law: ‘It is good, my daughter, that"
Ruth,2,23,So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.
Ruth,3,1,"And Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her: ‘My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may"
Ruth,3,2,"And now is there not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold,"
Ruth,3,3,"Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor; but make not thyself known unto the"
Ruth,3,4,"And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and"
Ruth,3,5,And she said unto her: ‘All that thou sayest unto me I will do.’
Ruth,3,6,"And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade"
Ruth,3,7,"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn; and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down."
Ruth,3,8,"And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was startled, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman"
Ruth,3,9,And he said: ‘Who art thou?’ And she answered: ‘I am Ruth thine handmaid; spread
Ruth,3,10,"And he said: ‘Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter; thou hast shown more kindness in the end than at the beginning, inasmuch"
Ruth,3,11,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest; for all the men in the gate of my people do know that thou art a virtuous"
Ruth,3,12,And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
Ruth,3,13,"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part; but if he be not willing to do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth; lie down until the morning.’"
Ruth,3,14,And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before one could discern another. For he
Ruth,3,15,"And he said: ‘Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it’; and she held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on"
Ruth,3,16,"And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said: ‘Who art thou,"
Ruth,3,17,And she said: ‘These six measures
Ruth,3,18,"Then said she: ‘Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day.’"
Ruth,4,1,"Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there; and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom he said: ‘Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.’ And he turned aside,"
Ruth,4,2,"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said: ‘Sit ye down here.’ And they"
Ruth,4,3,"And he said unto the near kinsman: ‘Naomi, that is come back out of the field of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s; 4and I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying: Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it; but if it will not be redeemed, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it"
Ruth,4,5,"Then said Boaz: ‘What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi—hast thou also bought of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the"
Ruth,4,6,"And the near kinsman said: ‘I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance; take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it.’—"
Ruth,4,7,"Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour; and this was the attestation"
Ruth,4,8,So the near kinsman said unto Boaz: ‘Buy it for thyself.’ And he drew off his shoe.
Ruth,4,9,"And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people: ‘Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all"
Ruth,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I acquired to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the"
Ruth,4,11,"And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said: ‘We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and do thou worthily in Ephrath, and be famous in Beth- lehem; 12and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.’ Boaz Marries Ruth"
Ruth,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and the LORD gave her"
Ruth,4,14,"And the women said unto Naomi: ‘Blessed be the LORD, who hath"
Ruth,4,15,"And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.’"
Ruth,4,16,"And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it."
Ruth,4,17,"And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying: ‘There is a son born to Naomi’; and they called his name Obed; he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. The Line of David (Matthew 1:1–17; Luke 3:23–38)"
Ruth,4,18,"Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron; 19and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab; 20and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon; 21and Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed; 22and Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David."
1 Samuel,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was"
1 Samuel,1,2,"And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
1 Samuel,1,3,And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of
1 Samuel,1,4,"And it came to pass upon a day, when Elkanah sacrificed, that he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions; 5but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah,"
1 Samuel,1,6,"And her rival vexed her sore, to make her fret, because the"
1 Samuel,1,7,"And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the"
1 Samuel,1,8,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her: ‘Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?’ Hannah Prays for a Son"
1 Samuel,1,9,"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk—now Eli the priest sat upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of the LORD; 10and she was in bitterness of soul—and"
1 Samuel,1,11,"And she vowed a vow, and said: ‘O LORD of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thy handmaid, but wilt give unto Thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.’"
1 Samuel,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she prayed long before the LORD, that Eli watched her mouth."
1 Samuel,1,13,"Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard; therefore, Eli"
1 Samuel,1,14,And Eli said unto her: ‘How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy

1 Samuel,1,16,Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman: for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation have I

1 Samuel,1,19,"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came"
1 Samuel,1,20,"And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she called his name Samuel: ‘because I have asked him of the LORD.’"
1 Samuel,1,21,"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his"
1 Samuel,1,22,"But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband: ‘Until the child be weaned, when I"
1 Samuel,1,23,And Elkanah her husband said unto her: ‘Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD

1 Samuel,1,25,And
1 Samuel,1,26,"And she said: ‘Oh, my lord, as thy soul"
1 Samuel,1,27,For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath granted me my petition which I asked of Him; 28therefore I also have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he is lent to the LORD.’ And he worshipped the LORD there.
1 Samuel,2,1,"And Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exulteth in the LORD, My horn is exalted in the LORD; My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; Because I rejoice in Thy salvation."
1 Samuel,2,2,"There is none holy as the LORD, For there is none beside Thee; Neither is there any rock like our God."
1 Samuel,2,3,"Multiply not exceeding proud talk; Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth; For the LORD is a God of knowledge, And by Him actions are weighed."
1 Samuel,2,4,"The bows of the mighty men are broken, And they that stumbled are girded with strength."
1 Samuel,2,5,"They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; And they that were hungry have ceased; While the barren hath borne seven, She that had many children hath languished."
1 Samuel,2,6,"The LORD killeth, and maketh alive; He bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up."
1 Samuel,2,7,"The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich; He bringeth low, He also lifteth up."
1 Samuel,2,8,"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, He lifteth up the needy from the dung-hill, To make them sit with princes, And inherit the throne of glory; For the pillars of the earth are the LORD’S, And He hath set the world upon them."
1 Samuel,2,9,"He will keep the feet of His holy ones, But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; For not by strength shall man prevail."
1 Samuel,2,10,"They that strive with the LORD shall be broken to pieces; Against them will He thunder in heaven; The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; And He will give strength unto His king, And exalt the horn of His anointed."
1 Samuel,2,11,And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest. Eli’s Wicked Sons
1 Samuel,2,12,Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not the LORD.
1 Samuel,2,13,"And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his band; 14and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did unto all the"
1 Samuel,2,15,"Yea, before the fat was made to smoke, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed: ‘Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden"
1 Samuel,2,16,"And if the man said unto him: ‘Let the fat be made to smoke first of all, and then take as much as thy soul desireth’; then he would say: ‘Nay, but thou shalt give it me now; and"
1 Samuel,2,17,And the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD; for the men dealt contemptuously with the offering of the LORD.
1 Samuel,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod."
1 Samuel,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her"
1 Samuel,2,20,"And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say: ‘The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to the LORD.’ And they would go unto their own home."
1 Samuel,2,21,"So the LORD remembered Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD."
1 Samuel,2,22,"Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with"
1 Samuel,2,23,And he said unto them: ‘Why do ye
1 Samuel,2,24,"Nay, my sons; for it is no"
1 Samuel,2,25,"If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him?’ But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them."
1 Samuel,2,26,"And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with the LORD, and also with men. A Prophecy against the House of Eli"
1 Samuel,2,27,"And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Did I reveal Myself"
1 Samuel,2,28,"And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up unto Mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children"

1 Samuel,2,30,"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, saith: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before Me for ever; but now the LORD saith: Be it far from Me: for them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be"

1 Samuel,2,32,"And thou shalt behold a rival in My habitation, in all the good which shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever."
1 Samuel,2,33,"Yet will I not cut off every man of thine from Mine altar, to make thine eyes to fail, and thy heart to"
1 Samuel,2,34,"And this shall be the sign unto thee, that which shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of"
1 Samuel,2,35,"And I will raise Me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in My heart and"
1 Samuel,2,36,"And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say: Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.’"
1 Samuel,3,1,And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.
1 Samuel,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place—now his eyes had begun to wax dim, that he could not see— 3and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, 4that the LORD called Samuel;"
1 Samuel,3,5,"And he ran unto Eli, and said: ‘Here am I; for thou didst call me.’ And he"
1 Samuel,3,6,"And the LORD called yet again Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said: ‘Here am I; for thou didst call me.’ And he answered: ‘I"
1 Samuel,3,7,"Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of"
1 Samuel,3,8,"And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said: ‘Here am I; for thou didst call me.’ And Eli perceived that the LORD was calling"
1 Samuel,3,9,"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel: ‘Go, lie down; and it shall be, if thou be called, that thou shalt say: Speak, LORD; for Thy servant heareth.’ So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
1 Samuel,3,10,"And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times: ‘Samuel, Samuel.’ Then Samuel said:"
1 Samuel,3,11,"And the LORD said to Samuel: ‘Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,"
1 Samuel,3,12,In that day I will perform against Eli
1 Samuel,3,13,"For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity, in that he knew that his sons did bring a curse"
1 Samuel,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.’ Samuel Shares the Vision"
1 Samuel,3,15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel"
1 Samuel,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said: ‘Samuel, my son.’ And he said: ‘Here"
1 Samuel,3,17,"And he said: ‘What is the thing that He hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me, God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that He spoke"
1 Samuel,3,18,"And Samuel told him all the words, and hid nothing from him. And he said: ‘It is the LORD; let Him do what seemeth Him good.’"
1 Samuel,3,19,"And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground."
1 Samuel,3,20,And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of
1 Samuel,3,21,And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh; for the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
1 Samuel,4,1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and"
1 Samuel,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and when the battle was spread, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and"
1 Samuel,4,3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said: ‘Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that He may come among us, and"
1 Samuel,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who sitteth upon the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God."
1 Samuel,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great"
1 Samuel,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said: ‘What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?’ And they knew that the ark of the"
1 Samuel,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said: ‘God is come into the camp.’ And they said: ‘Woe unto us! for there was not such a thing yesterday and the day before."
1 Samuel,4,8,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that
1 Samuel,4,9,"Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you; quit yourselves like men, and fight.’"
1 Samuel,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent; and there"
1 Samuel,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain. The Death of Eli"
1 Samuel,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes"
1 Samuel,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it,"
1 Samuel,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said: ‘What meaneth the noise"
1 Samuel,4,15,Now Eli was ninety and eight years
1 Samuel,4,16,And the man said unto Eli: ‘I am he that came out
1 Samuel,4,17,"And he that brought the tidings answered and said: ‘Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and"
1 Samuel,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years."
1 Samuel,4,19,"And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to be delivered; and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she"
1 Samuel,4,20,And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her: ‘Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son.’ But
1 Samuel,4,21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying: ‘The glory is departed from Israel’; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her"
1 Samuel,4,22,And she said: ‘The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.’
1 Samuel,5,1,"Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod."
1 Samuel,5,2,And
1 Samuel,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground"
1 Samuel,5,4,"And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold;"
1 Samuel,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day."
1 Samuel,5,6,"But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and He destroyed them, and smote them"
1 Samuel,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said: ‘The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for His hand is sore upon us, and"
1 Samuel,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said: ‘What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?’ And they answered: ‘Let the ark of the God"
1 Samuel,5,9,"And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great discomfiture; and He smote the men of the city, both small and great, and emerods broke out"
1 Samuel,5,10,"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying: ‘They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to"
1 Samuel,5,11,"They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said: ‘Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people’; for there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the"
1 Samuel,5,12,And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1 Samuel,6,1,And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
1 Samuel,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying: ‘What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? declare unto us"
1 Samuel,6,3,"And they said: ‘If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return Him a guilt-offering; then ye shall be healed, and it shall be"
1 Samuel,6,4,"Then said they: ‘What shall be the guilt-offering which we shall return to Him?’ And they said: ‘Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords."
1 Samuel,6,5,"Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel; peradventure He will lighten His hand from off you, and from"
1 Samuel,6,6,"Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when He had wrought among them, did they not let the people"

1 Samuel,6,9,"And see, if it goeth up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then He hath done us this great evil; but if not, then we shall know that it is not His hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.’"
1 Samuel,6,10,"And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at"
1 Samuel,6,11,"And they put the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the"
1 Samuel,6,12,"And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh."
1 Samuel,6,13,And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their

1 Samuel,6,15,"And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day"

1 Samuel,15,1,"And Samuel said unto Saul: ‘The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over His people, over Israel;"

1 Samuel,15,17,"And Samuel said: ‘Though thou be little in thine own sight, art thou not head of the tribes of Israel? And the LORD anointed thee king over Israel; 18and the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said: Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed."
1 Samuel,15,19,"Wherefore then didst thou not hearken to the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of the LORD?’"
1 Samuel,15,20,"And Saul said unto Samuel: ‘Yea, I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed"

1 Samuel,15,33,"And Samuel said: As thy sword hath made women childless, So shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,34,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeath-shaul.
1 Samuel,15,35,And Samuel never beheld Saul again until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul; and the LORD repented that He had made Saul king over Israel.

1 Samuel,17,14,And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.—
1 Samuel,17,15,Now David went to and fro
1 Samuel,17,16,"And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days."
1 Samuel,17,17,"And Jesse said unto David his son: ‘Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and"

2 Samuel,12,18,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said: ‘Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice; how then shall we tell him that the child is dead, so that he do himself some harm?’"
2 Samuel,12,19,"But when David saw that his servants whispered together, David perceived that the child was dead;"
2 Samuel,12,20,"Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped; then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat."
2 Samuel,12,21,Then said his servants unto him: ‘What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep

2 Samuel,12,24,"And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her; and she bore a son, and called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him; 25and He sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called his name Jedidiah, for the LORD’S sake. The Capture of Rabbah (1 Chronicles 20:1–3)"
2 Samuel,12,26,"Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city."
2 Samuel,12,27,"And Joab sent messengers to David, and said: ‘I have fought against Rabbah, yea, I have taken the city of waters."
2 Samuel,12,28,"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest"
2 Samuel,12,29,"And David gathered all the people together, and went"
2 Samuel,12,30,"And he took the crown of Malcam from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David’s"
2 Samuel,12,31,"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln; and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,13,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was"

2 Samuel,13,5,"And Jonadab said unto him: ‘Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick; and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him: Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread"
2 Samuel,13,6,"So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick; and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king: ‘Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.’"
2 Samuel,13,7,"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying: ‘Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him food.’"
2 Samuel,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. And she took dough, and"

2 Samuel,13,14,"Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her."
2 Samuel,13,15,Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was

2 Samuel,13,18,Now she had a garment of many colours upon her; for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins
2 Samuel,13,19,"And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of many colours that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went."
2 Samuel,13,20,"And Absalom her brother said unto her: ‘Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart.’ So Tamar remained desolate in her"
2 Samuel,13,21,"But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth."
2 Samuel,13,22,"And Absalom spoke unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. Absalom’s Revenge on Amnon"
2 Samuel,13,23,"And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the king’s sons."
2 Samuel,13,24,"And Absalom came to the king, and said: ‘Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king,"
2 Samuel,13,25,"And the king said to Absalom: ‘Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee.’ And he pressed him; howbeit he would not go, but"
2 Samuel,13,26,"Then said Absalom: ‘If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us.’ And the king"
2 Samuel,13,27,"But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him."
2 Samuel,13,28,"And Absalom commanded his servants, saying: ‘Mark ye now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you: Smite Amnon, then kill him, fear not; have not I commanded you? be"
2 Samuel,13,29,"And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man got him up upon his mule, and fled."
2 Samuel,13,30,"And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying: ‘Absalom"
2 Samuel,13,31,"Then the king arose, and rent his"
2 Samuel,13,32,"And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said: ‘Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this"

2 Samuel,13,34,"But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold,"
2 Samuel,13,35,And Jonadab said unto the king:
2 Samuel,13,36,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very sore."
2 Samuel,13,37,"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned"
2 Samuel,13,38,"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years."
2 Samuel,13,39,"And the soul of king David failed with longing for Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead."
2 Samuel,14,1,Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.
2 Samuel,14,2,"And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her: ‘I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead; 3and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him.’ So Joab put the words in her mouth."
2 Samuel,14,4,"And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and prostrated"
2 Samuel,14,5,And the king said unto her: ‘What aileth thee?’ And she answered:
2 Samuel,14,6,"And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed"
2 Samuel,14,7,"And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they said: Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.’"
2 Samuel,14,8,"And the king said unto the woman: ‘Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.’"
2 Samuel,14,9,"And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king: ‘My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s"
2 Samuel,14,10,And the king said: ‘Whosoever saith aught unto
2 Samuel,14,11,"Then said she: ‘I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son.’ And he said: ‘As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.’"
2 Samuel,14,12,"Then the woman said: ‘Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king.’ And he"
2 Samuel,14,13,"And the woman said: ‘Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch"
2 Samuel,14,14,"For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person; but let him devise means, that he"
2 Samuel,14,15,"Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid; and thy handmaid said: I"
2 Samuel,14,16,"For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son"
2 Samuel,14,17,"Then thy handmaid said: Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be for my comfort; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad; and the LORD thy God be with thee.’"
2 Samuel,14,18,"Then the king answered and said unto the woman: ‘Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall"
2 Samuel,14,19,"And the king said: ‘Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this?’ And the woman answered and said: ‘As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid; 20to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing; and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.’"
2 Samuel,14,21,"And the king said unto Joab: ‘Behold now, I have granted this request; go therefore, bring the young"
2 Samuel,14,22,"And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and prostrated himself, and blessed the king; and Joab said: ‘To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favour in thy sight, my lord, O"
2 Samuel,14,23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur,"
2 Samuel,14,24,"And the king said: ‘Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face.’ So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face."
2 Samuel,14,25,Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty; from the sole of

2 Samuel,14,28,And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the kings face.
2 Samuel,14,29,"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him; and he sent again a second time, but"
2 Samuel,14,30,"Therefore he said unto his servants: ‘See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath"
2 Samuel,14,31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him: ‘Wherefore have thy servants set my field on"
2 Samuel,14,32,"And Absalom answered Joab: ‘Behold, I sent unto thee, saying: Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say: Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still;"
2 Samuel,14,33,"So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom."
2 Samuel,15,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run"
2 Samuel,15,2,"And Absalom used to rise up early, and stand beside the way of the gate; and it was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto"
2 Samuel,15,3,"And Absalom said unto him: ‘See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king"

2 Samuel,15,6,And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2 Samuel,15,7,"And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king: ‘I pray thee, let me"

2 Samuel,15,15,And the king’s servants said unto
2 Samuel,15,16,"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines,"

2 Samuel,15,22,"And David said to Ittai: ‘Go and pass over.’ And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him."
2 Samuel,15,23,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, as all the people passed over; and as the king passed over the brook Kidron, all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness."
2 Samuel,15,24,"And, lo, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God—but Abiathar went up—until all the people had done passing out of the"

2 Samuel,15,30,"And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot; and all the people that were with him covered every man his head,"
2 Samuel,15,31,"And one told David, saying: ‘Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.’ And David said: ‘O LORD, I pray Thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.’"
2 Samuel,15,32,"And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the ascent, where God was wont to be worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head."
2 Samuel,15,33,"And David said unto him: ‘If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto Me; 34but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom: I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel."
2 Samuel,15,35,"And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests."
2 Samuel,15,36,"Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s son, and Jonathan Abiathar’s"
2 Samuel,15,37,So Hushai David’s friend came into the city; and Absalom was at the point of coming into Jerusalem.
2 Samuel,16,1,"And when David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins,"
2 Samuel,16,2,"And the king said unto Ziba: ‘What meanest thou by these?’ And Ziba said: ‘The asses are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may"

2 Samuel,16,4,"Then said the king to Ziba: ‘Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth.’ And Ziba said: ‘I prostrate myself; let me find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.’ Shimei Curses David"
2 Samuel,16,5,"And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and kept on cursing as he"
2 Samuel,16,6,"And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all"
2 Samuel,16,7,"And thus said Shimei when he cursed: ‘Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow; 8the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.’"
2 Samuel,16,9,Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king: ‘Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?

2 Samuel,16,15,"And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him."
2 Samuel,16,16,"And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai"
2 Samuel,16,17,And Absalom said to Hushai: ‘Is this thy

2 Samuel,16,19,"And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.’"
2 Samuel,16,20,Then said Absalom to Ahithophel: ‘Give your counsel what we shall do.’
2 Samuel,16,21,"And Ahithophel said unto Absalom: ‘Go in unto thy father’s concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will"

2 Samuel,17,4,"And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel."
2 Samuel,17,5,"Then said Absalom: ‘Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.’"

2 Samuel,17,27,"And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, 28brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse, 29and honey, and curd, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat; for they said: ‘The people is hungry, and faint, and thirsty, in the wilderness.’"
2 Samuel,18,1,"And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of"
2 Samuel,18,2,"And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of"
2 Samuel,18,3,"But the people said: ‘Thou shalt not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us; but thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that"
2 Samuel,18,4,"And the king said unto them: ‘What seemeth you best I will do.’ And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands."
2 Samuel,18,5,"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying: ‘Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.’ And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom."
2 Samuel,18,6,So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
2 Samuel,18,7,"And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter"
2 Samuel,18,8,For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
2 Samuel,18,9,"And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth, and his head caught hold of the terebinth, and"
2 Samuel,18,10,And
2 Samuel,18,11,"And Joab said unto the man that told him: ‘And, behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite him"
2 Samuel,18,12,"And the man said unto Joab: ‘Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and"
2 Samuel,18,13,Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against mine own life—and there is no matter hid from the king—then thou thyself wouldest have stood aloof.’
2 Samuel,18,14,"Then said Joab: ‘I may not tarry thus with thee.’ And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust"
2 Samuel,18,15,"And ten young men that bore Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him."
2 Samuel,18,16,"And Joab blew the horn, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the"

2 Samuel,18,18,"Now Absalom in his life-time had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king’s dale; for he said: ‘I have no son to keep my name in remembrance’; and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom’s monument unto this day. David Mourns for Absalom"
2 Samuel,18,19,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok: ‘Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD"
2 Samuel,18,20,"And Joab said unto him: ‘Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, forasmuch as"
2 Samuel,18,21,Then said Joab to the Cushite: ‘Go tell the king what thou hast seen.’ And
2 Samuel,18,22,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab: ‘But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite.’ And Joab said: ‘Wherefore wilt"
2 Samuel,18,23,"But come what may, [said he,] I will run.’ And he said unto him: ‘Run.’ Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and overran the Cushite."
2 Samuel,18,24,Now David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the
2 Samuel,18,25,"And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said: ‘If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth.’ And he came apace,"
2 Samuel,18,26,"And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called unto the porter, and said: ‘Behold another man running alone.’ And the king said: ‘He also bringeth tidings.’"
2 Samuel,18,27,"And the watchman said: ‘I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.’ And the king said: ‘He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.’"
2 Samuel,18,28,"And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king: ‘All is well.’ And he bowed down before the king with his face to the earth, and said: ‘Blessed be the LORD thy God, who hath delivered up the men that"
2 Samuel,18,29,"And the king said: ‘Is it well with the young man Absalom?’ And Ahimaaz answered: ‘When Joab sent the king’s servant, and me thy servant, I saw a"
2 Samuel,18,30,"And the king said: ‘Turn aside, and stand here.’ And he turned aside, and stood still."
2 Samuel,18,31,"And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said: ‘Tidings for my lord the king; for the LORD"
2 Samuel,18,32,"And the king said unto the Cushite: ‘Is it well with the young man Absalom?’ And the Cushite answered: ‘The enemies of my lord the king and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.’"
2 Samuel,18,33,"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went, thus he said: ‘O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!’"
2 Samuel,19,1,"And it was told Joab: ‘Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.’"
2 Samuel,19,2,And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard say that day: ‘The king grieveth for

2 Samuel,19,14,"And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent unto the king: ‘Return thou, and all thy servants.’"
2 Samuel,19,15,"So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan. Shimei Pardoned"

2 Samuel,19,40,"So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him; and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel. Contention over the King"

2 Samuel,19,42,And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel: ‘Because the king is near of kin to us; wherefore then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s cost?
2 Samuel,19,43,"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said: ‘We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye; why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?’ And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel."
2 Samuel,20,1,"Now there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the horn, and said: ‘We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to his tents, O Israel.’"
2 Samuel,20,2,"So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah did cleave unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,20,3,"And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, in widowhood, with their husband alive."
2 Samuel,20,4,"Then said the king to Amasa: ‘Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here"
2 Samuel,20,5,So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time

2 Samuel,20,9,"And Joab said to Amasa: ‘Is it well with thee, my brother?’ And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him."
2 Samuel,20,10,"But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand; so he smote him therewith in the groin, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. And Joab and"

2 Samuel,20,13,"When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri."
2 Samuel,20,14,"And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites; and"
2 Samuel,20,15,"And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood in the moat; and all the people"
2 Samuel,20,16,Then cried a wise woman out of the city:
2 Samuel,20,17,And he came near unto her; and the woman said: ‘Art thou Joab?’ And he answered: ‘I am.’ Then she said unto him:
2 Samuel,20,18,"Then she spoke, saying: ‘They were wont to speak in old time, saying: They shall surely ask counsel at Abel; and so they ended the matter."
2 Samuel,20,19,We are of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel; seekest thou to destroy a city and a mother

2 Samuel,20,21,"The matter is not so; but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.’ And the woman said unto Joab: ‘Behold,"
2 Samuel,20,22,"Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the horn, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king."
2 Samuel,20,23,Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites; 24and Adoram was over the levy; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder; 25and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 26and Ira also the Jairite was chief minister unto David.

Solomon’s Twelve Officers"
1 Kings,4,7,"And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household:"
1 Kings,4,8,"And these are their names: The son of Hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim; 9the son of Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan; 10the son of Hesed, in Arubboth; to him pertained Socoh, and all the land of Hepher; 11the son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife;"

1 Kings,4,19,"Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and one officer that was [over all the officers] in the land. Solomon’s Prosperity"
1 Kings,4,20,"Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry."
1 Kings,4,21,"And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt; they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life."
1 Kings,4,22,"And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal; 23ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, beside harts, and"
1 Kings,4,24,"For he had dominion over all the region on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River; and he had peace on all"
1 Kings,4,25,"And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his"
1 Kings,4,26,And Solomon had forty thousand

1 Kings,4,28,"Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where it should be, every man according to his charge. Solomon’s Wisdom"
1 Kings,4,29,"And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even"
1 Kings,4,30,And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
1 Kings,4,31,"For he was wiser than all men: than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the nations round about."
1 Kings,4,32,And he spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five.
1 Kings,4,33,"And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spoke"
1 Kings,4,34,"And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom."
1 Kings,5,1,And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him
1 Kings,5,2,"And Solomon sent to Hiram,"
1 Kings,5,3,"Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of"
1 Kings,5,4,"But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor"
1 Kings,5,5,"And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke unto David my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he"
1 Kings,5,6,Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say; for thou knowest that there is not among us any that hath skill to hew timber like unto the Zidonians.’ Hiram’s Reply to Solomon (2 Chronicles 2:11–18)
1 Kings,5,7,"And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said:"
1 Kings,5,8,"And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: ‘I have heard that which thou hast sent unto me; I will do all thy desire"
1 Kings,5,9,"My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt"
1 Kings,5,10,So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and
1 Kings,5,11,"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of beaten oil; thus gave Solomon to Hiram year"
1 Kings,5,12,"And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together. Solomon’s Labor Force"
1 Kings,5,13,And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
1 Kings,5,14,"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two"
1 Kings,5,15,"And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains; 16besides Solomon’s chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the"
1 Kings,5,17,"And the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly"
1 Kings,5,18,"And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house."
1 Kings,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the"
1 Kings,6,2,"And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,"
1 Kings,6,3,"And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof"
1 Kings,6,4,"And for the house he made windows broad within, and narrow without. The Chambers"
1 Kings,6,5,"And against the wall of the house he built a side-structure round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the sanctuary; and he made side-chambers round about; 6the nethermost story of the side-structure was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made rebatements in the wall of the house round about, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.—"
1 Kings,6,7,"For the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.—"
1 Kings,6,8,The door for the lowest row of chambers was in the right side of the house and they went up by
1 Kings,6,9,"So he built the house, and"
1 Kings,6,10,"And he built the stories of the side-structure against all the house, each five cubits high; and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. God’s Promise to Solomon"
1 Kings,6,11,"And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying:"
1 Kings,6,12,"As for this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in My statutes, and execute Mine ordinances, and keep all My commandments to walk in them; then will I establish My word with thee, which I spoke unto David thy father; 13in that I will dwell therein among the children of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.’ The Temple’s Interior (2 Chronicles 3:5–9)"
1 Kings,6,14,"So Solomon built the house, and finished it."
1 Kings,6,15,"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house unto the joists of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house"
1 Kings,6,16,"And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the joists; he even built them for himself within, for a Sanctuary, even for"
1 Kings,6,17,"And the house, that is, the temple before [the Sanctuary], was forty cubits long."
1 Kings,6,18,And the cedar on the house within was carved with knops and open flowers; all was cedar; there
1 Kings,6,19,"And he prepared the Sanctuary in the midst of the house within, to set there the"
1 Kings,6,20,"And before the Sanctuary which was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof, overlaid with pure gold, he set an"
1 Kings,6,21,So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold; and he
1 Kings,6,22,"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished; also the whole altar that belonged to the Sanctuary he overlaid with gold. The Cherubim (2 Chronicles 3:10–13)"
1 Kings,6,23,"And in the Sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high."
1 Kings,6,24,"And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub; from the uttermost part"
1 Kings,6,25,And the other cherub was ten
1 Kings,6,26,The height of the one cherub was ten
1 Kings,6,27,"And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of"
1 Kings,6,28,And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1 Kings,6,29,And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees
1 Kings,6,30,"And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. The Doors"
1 Kings,6,31,"And for the entrance of the Sanctuary he made doors of olive-wood, the door-posts within the frame"
1 Kings,6,32,"And as for the two doors of olive-wood, he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees."
1 Kings,6,33,"So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, within a frame four-square; 34and two doors of cypress-wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of"
1 Kings,6,35,And he carved thereon cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work. The Courtyard
1 Kings,6,36,"And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams."
1 Kings,6,37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Ziv."
1 Kings,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it."
1 Kings,7,1,"And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house."
1 Kings,7,2,"For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon: the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon"
1 Kings,7,3,"And it was covered with cedar above upon the side-chambers, that lay on forty and five"
1 Kings,7,4,And there were beams in three rows; and light was over against light in three
1 Kings,7,5,And all the doors with their posts were square in the frame; and light was over against light in three ranks.
1 Kings,7,6,"And he made the porch of pillars: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and thick beams before them."
1 Kings,7,7,"And he made the porch of the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment; and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor."
1 Kings,7,8,"And his house where he might dwell, in the other court, within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Solomon had taken to wife, like unto this porch."
1 Kings,7,9,"All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court."
1 Kings,7,10,"And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight"
1 Kings,7,11,"And above were costly stones, after the measure of hewn stones, and cedar-wood."
1 Kings,7,12,"And the great court round about had three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams, like as the inner court of the house of the LORD, and the court of the porch of the house. The Pillars and Capitals (2 Chronicles 3:14–17)"
1 Kings,7,13,And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
1 Kings,7,14,"He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work."
1 Kings,7,15,"Thus he fashioned the two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high each; and a line of twelve cubits"
1 Kings,7,16,"And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other"
1 Kings,7,17,"He also made nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars: seven for the one capital, and seven for the other"
1 Kings,7,18,"And he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pomegranates; and so did he for the other capital."
1 Kings,7,19,"And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits."
1 Kings,7,20,"And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the"
1 Kings,7,21,"And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple; and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof"
1 Kings,7,22,And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work; so was the work of the pillars finished. The Molten Sea (2 Chronicles 4:1–5)
1 Kings,7,23,"And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height"
1 Kings,7,24,"And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about;"
1 Kings,7,25,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking"
1 Kings,7,26,"And it was a hand-breadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held two thousand baths. The Ten Bronze Stands"
1 Kings,7,27,"And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the"
1 Kings,7,28,"And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders; and there were borders between the stays; 29and on the borders that were between the stays were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the stays it was in like manner above; and beneath"
1 Kings,7,30,"And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters; beneath the laver were the undersetters molten,"
1 Kings,7,31,"And the mouth of it within the crown and above was a cubit high; and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the"
1 Kings,7,32,And the four wheels were underneath the borders; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base; and the height of a wheel
1 Kings,7,33,And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel; their
1 Kings,7,34,And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base; the undersetters thereof were of one piece with the
1 Kings,7,35,And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high; and on the
1 Kings,7,36,"And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees,"
1 Kings,7,37,"After this manner he made the ten bases; all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form. The Ten Bronze Basins (2 Chronicles 4:6–8)"
1 Kings,7,38,And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and every laver was four cubits;
1 Kings,7,39,"And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south. Completion of the Bronze Works (2 Chronicles 4:11–18)"
1 Kings,7,40,"And Hiram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of the LORD: 41the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; 42and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars; 43and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases; 44and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea; 45and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins; even all these vessels,"
1 Kings,7,46,In the plain
1 Kings,7,47,"And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many; the weight of the brass could not be found out. Completion of the Gold Furnishings (2 Chronicles 4:19–22)"
1 Kings,7,48,"And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold; 49and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the Sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; 50and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the pans, and the fire-pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, that is, of the temple, of gold."
1 Kings,7,51,"Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD."
1 Kings,8,1,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ houses of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the"
1 Kings,8,2,And all the men of Israel assembled
1 Kings,8,3,And
1 Kings,8,4,"And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the"
1 Kings,8,5,"And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told"
1 Kings,8,6,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto its place, into the Sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim."
1 Kings,8,7,"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the"
1 Kings,8,8,"And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place, even before the Sanctuary; but they could not be seen without; and there they"
1 Kings,8,9,"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land"
1 Kings,8,10,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, 11so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD. Solomon Blesses the LORD (2 Chronicles 6:1–11)"
1 Kings,8,12,Then spoke Solomon: The LORD hath said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.
1 Kings,8,13,"I have surely built Thee a house of habitation, A place for Thee to dwell in for ever."
1 Kings,8,14,"And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel; and all the"

1 Kings,8,21,"And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which He made with our fathers, when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.’ Solomon’s Prayer of Dedication (2 Chronicles 6:12–42)"
1 Kings,8,22,"And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven; 23and he said: ‘O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like Thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and mercy with Thy servants, that walk before Thee with all their heart; 24who hast kept with Thy servant David my father that which Thou didst promise him; yea, Thou spokest with Thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with Thy hand, as it is"
1 Kings,8,25,"Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with Thy servant David my father that which Thou hast promised him saying: There shall not fail thee a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before Me as thou hast walked before Me."
1 Kings,8,26,"Now therefore, O God of Israel, let Thy word, I pray Thee, be verified, which Thou didst speak unto Thy servant David my father."
1 Kings,8,27,"But will God in very truth dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot"
1 Kings,8,28,"Yet have Thou respect unto the prayer of Thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which Thy servant prayeth before Thee this day; 29that Thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof Thou hast said: My name shall be there; to hearken"
1 Kings,8,30,"And hearken Thou to the supplication of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place; yea, hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place; and when Thou hearest, forgive."
1 Kings,8,31,"If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be exacted of him to cause him to swear, and he come and swear before Thine altar in this house; 32then hear Thou in heaven, and do, and judge Thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness."
1 Kings,8,33,"When Thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy, when they do sin against Thee, if they turn again to Thee, and confess Thy name, and pray and make supplication unto Thee in this house; 34then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy people Israel, and bring them back unto the land which Thou gavest unto their fathers."
1 Kings,8,35,"When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, when they do sin against Thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess Thy name, and turn from their sin, when Thou dost afflict them; 36then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, when Thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon Thy land, which Thou hast given to Thy people for an inheritance."
1 Kings,8,37,"If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; 38what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man of all Thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house; 39then hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest—for Thou, even Thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men— 40that they may fear Thee all the days that they live in the land which Thou gavest unto our fathers."
1 Kings,8,41,"Moreover concerning the stranger that is not of Thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for Thy name’s sake— 42for they shall hear of Thy great name, and of Thy mighty hand, and of Thine outstretched arm—when he shall come and pray toward this house; 43hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to Thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy name, to fear Thee, as doth Thy people Israel, and that they may know that Thy name is called upon this house which I have built."
1 Kings,8,44,"If Thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way Thou shalt send them, and they pray unto the LORD toward the city which Thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Thy name; 45then hear Thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
1 Kings,8,46,"If they sin against Thee—for there is no man that sinneth not—and Thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far off or near; 47yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn back, and make supplication unto Thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying: We have sinned, and have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly; 48if they return unto Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray unto Thee toward their land, which Thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for Thy name; 49then hear Thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause; 50and forgive Thy people who have sinned against Thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against Thee; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them; 51for they are Thy people, and Thine inheritance, which Thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron; 52that Thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of Thy servant, and unto the supplication"
1 Kings,8,53,"For Thou didst set them apart from among all the peoples of the earth, to be Thine inheritance, as Thou didst speak by the hand of Moses Thy servant, when Thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.’ Solomon’s Benediction"
1 Kings,8,54,"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands"
1 Kings,8,55,"And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying:"

Fasting for Protection"
Ezra,8,21,"Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God,"
Ezra,8,22,"For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way; because we had spoken unto the king, saying: ‘The hand of our God is upon all them that seek Him,"
Ezra,8,23,So we fasted and besought our God for this; and He was entreated of us. Priests to Guard the Offerings
Ezra,8,24,"Then I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests, besides Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, 25and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel"
Ezra,8,26,"I even weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents; of gold a hundred talents; 27and twenty bowels of gold, of a thousand"

Ezra,8,31,"Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and lier-in- wait by the way. Arrival in Jerusalem"
Ezra,8,32,"And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days."
Ezra,8,33,"And on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levites; 34the whole by number and by weight; and all the weight was written at that time."

Ezra,9,10,"And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken Thy commandments, 11which Thou hast commanded by Thy servants the prophets, saying: The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations,"

Ezra,9,13,"And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that Thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a remnant, 14shall we again break Thy commandments, and make marriages with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not Thou be angry with us till Thou hadst consumed us,"
Ezra,9,15,"O LORD, the God of Israel, Thou art righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day; behold, we are before Thee in our guiltiness; for none can stand before Thee because of this.’"
Ezra,10,1,"Now while Ezra prayed, and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women"

Nehemiah,9,7,"Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham; 8and foundest his heart faithful before Thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, even to give it unto his seed, and hast performed Thy words; for Thou art righteous;"
Nehemiah,9,9,"And Thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea; 10and didst show signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for Thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them; and didst get Thee a name, as it is this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"And Thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers Thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"Moreover in a pillar of cloud Thou didst lead them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go."
Nehemiah,9,13,"Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spokest with them from heaven, and gavest them right ordinances and laws of truth, good statutes and commandments; 14and madest known unto them Thy holy sabbath, and didst command them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by the hand of Moses Thy servant; 15and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and didst command them that they should go in to possess the land which Thou hadst lifted up Thy hand to give them."
Nehemiah,9,16,"But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to Thy commandments, 17and refused to hearken, neither were mindful of Thy wonders that Thou didst among them; but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage; but Thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy, and forsookest them not."
Nehemiah,9,18,"Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said: ‘This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; 19yet Thou in Thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness; the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go."
Nehemiah,9,20,"Thou gavest also Thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not Thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah,9,21,"Yea, forty years didst Thou sustain them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not."
Nehemiah,9,22,"Moreover Thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which Thou didst allot quarter by quarter; so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"Their children also didst Thou multiply as the stars of heaven, and didst bring them into the land, concerning which Thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it."
Nehemiah,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed the land, and Thou didst subdue before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would."
Nehemiah,9,25,"And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance; so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and luxuriated in Thy great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against Thee, and cast Thy law behind their back, and slew Thy prophets that did forewarn them to turn them back unto Thee, and they wrought great provocations."
Nehemiah,9,27,"Therefore Thou didst deliver them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them; and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto Thee, Thou heardest from heaven; and according to Thy manifold mercies Thou gavest them saviours who might save them out of the hand of their adversaries."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before Thee; therefore didst Thou leave them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned, and cried unto Thee, many times didst Thou hear from heaven, and deliver them according to Thy mercies; 29and didst forewarn them, that Thou mightest bring them back unto Thy law; yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto Thy commandments, but sinned against Thine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them, and presented a stubborn shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."

Nehemiah,9,33,"Howbeit Thou art just in all that is come upon us; for Thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly; 34neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept Thy law, nor hearkened unto Thy commandments and Thy testimonies, wherewith Thou didst testify against them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"For they have not served Thee in their kingdom, and in Thy great goodness that Thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which Thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works."
Nehemiah,9,36,"Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that Thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it."
Nehemiah,9,37,"And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom Thou hast set over us because of our sins; also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.’"

Nehemiah,13,16,"There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of ware, and sold"

Nehemiah,13,19,"And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath; and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in"
Nehemiah,13,20,So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once

Esther,1,1,"NOW IT came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus—this is Ahasuerus who reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces— 2that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the castle, 3in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the army of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him; 4when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty, many days, even a hundred and fourscore days."
Esther,1,5,"And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the castle, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace; 6there were hangings of white, fine cotton, and blue, bordered with cords of fine linen and purple, upon silver rods and pillars of marble; the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of green,"
Esther,1,7,And they gave them drink in vessels of gold—the vessels being

Esther,1,9,Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Bizzetha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, 11to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown"
Esther,1,12,"But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the chamberlains; therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him. Queen Vashti Deposed"
Esther,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times—for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment; 14and the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and"
Esther,1,15,"What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, forasmuch as"
Esther,1,16,"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes: ‘Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to"
Esther,1,17,"For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it will be said: The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before"
Esther,1,18,And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say the like unto all the king’s princes. So will there arise enough contempt and
Esther,1,19,"If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before"
Esther,1,20,"And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom, great though it be, all the wives will give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.’"
Esther,1,21,"And the word pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan; 22for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and speak according to the language of his people."
Esther,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was assuaged, he remembered Vashti, and"
Esther,2,2,"Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him: ‘Let there be sought for the king young virgins fair to look on; 3and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the castle, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their ointments be given them; 4and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti.’ And the thing pleased the king; and he did so. Esther Finds Favor"
Esther,2,5,"There was a certain Jew in Shushan the castle, whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish, a Benjamite, 6who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon"
Esther,2,7,"And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was of beautiful form and fair to look on; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter."
Esther,2,8,"So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was published, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the castle, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was"
Esther,2,9,"And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her ointments, with her portions, and the seven maidens, who were meet to be given her out of the king’s house; and he advanced her and"
Esther,2,10,Esther had not made known her people
Esther,2,11,"And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her."
Esther,2,12,"Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women, twelve months—for so were the days of their anointing accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six month with sweet odours, and with other ointments of the women— 13when then the maiden came unto the king, whatsoever she desired was"
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, who kept the concubines; she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name."
Esther,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them"
Esther,2,16,"So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. Esther Becomes Queen"
Esther,2,17,"And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of"
Esther,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king."
Esther,2,19,"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, and Mordecai sat in the king’s gate—"
Esther,2,20,"Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him— Mordecai Uncovers a Conspiracy 21in those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and"
Esther,2,22,"And the thing became known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king"
Esther,2,23,"And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king."
Esther,3,1,"After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and"
Esther,3,2,"And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed down, and prostrated themselves before Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor prostrated himself before him."
Esther,3,3,"Then the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai: ‘Why transgressest thou"
Esther,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s words would stand; for he had told"
Esther,3,5,"And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor prostrated himself"
Esther,3,6,"But it seemed contemptible in his eyes to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai; wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai."
Esther,3,7,"In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, which"
Esther,3,8,And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus: ‘There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from those of every people; neither keep they the king’s laws; therefore it profiteth not the king to suffer
Esther,3,9,"If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the king’s business, to bring it into the king’s"
Esther,3,10,"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha"
Esther,3,11,"And the king said unto Haman: ‘The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.’"
Esther,3,12,"Then were the king’s scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof, and there was written, according to all that Haman commanded, unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people; to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it"
Esther,3,13,"And letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of"

Esther,3,15,"The posts went forth in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the castle; and the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed."
Esther,4,1,"Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; 2and he came"
Esther,4,3,"And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,And Esther’s maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly pained; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai; and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he
Esther,4,5,"Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it"
Esther,4,6,"So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king’s"
Esther,4,7,"And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that"
Esther,4,8,"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her; and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people."
Esther,4,9,And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther,4,10,"Then Esther spoke unto Hathach, and"
Esther,4,11,"All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live; but I have not been called to come in unto the king these"
Esther,4,12,And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
Esther,4,13,Then Mordecai bade them to return answer unto Esther: ‘Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape
Esther,4,14,"For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father’s house will perish; and who knoweth whether thou art not come to royal estate for such a time as this?’"
Esther,4,15,Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai:
Esther,4,16,"Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day; I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the"
Esther,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."
Esther,5,1,"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house; and the king sat upon his royal throne in the"

Esther,5,9,"Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, Haman was filled with wrath against Mordecai."
Esther,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and"
Esther,5,11,"And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and everything as to how the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above"
Esther,5,12,"Haman said moreover: ‘Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I"

Esther,5,14,"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him: ‘Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon; then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet.’ And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made."
Esther,6,1,On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the

Esther,6,6,So Haman came in. And the king said unto him: ‘What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour?’—Now Haman said in his heart: ‘Whom would the king delight to
Esther,6,7,"And Haman said unto the king: ‘For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, 8let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on whose head a crown royal is set; 9and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honour, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him: Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.’"
Esther,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman: ‘Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate; let nothing fail of all that thou hast"
Esther,6,11,"Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him: ‘Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.’"
Esther,6,12,"And Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his"
Esther,6,13,"And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him: ‘If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.’"
Esther,6,14,"While they were yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hastened to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
Esther,7,2,"And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine: ‘Whatever thy petition, queen Esther, it shall be granted"
Esther,7,3,"Then Esther the queen answered and said: ‘If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request; 4for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I"

Esther,7,7,And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden; but Haman remained to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined
Esther,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king: ‘Will he even force the queen before me in the house?’ As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered"
Esther,7,9,"Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king: ‘Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king,"
Esther,7,10,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath assuaged.
Esther,8,1,On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen.
Esther,8,2,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
Esther,8,3,"And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews."
Esther,8,4,"Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king."
Esther,8,5,"And she said: ‘If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king’s provinces; 6for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?’ The Decree of Xerxes"
Esther,8,7,"Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew: ‘Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"Write ye also concerning the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse.’"
Esther,8,9,"Then were the king’s scribes called at that time, in the third month, which is the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews, even to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing,"
Esther,8,10,"And they wrote in the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king’s service, bred of the stud; 11that the king had granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, and to slay, and to cause to perish, all the forces of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey, 12upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the"

Esther,8,14,"So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the king’s service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the castle."
Esther,8,15,"And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a rob of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan shouted and"
Esther,8,16,"The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honour."
Esther,8,17,"And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them."
Esther,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them; whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them; 2the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt; and no man could withstand"
Esther,9,3,"And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the king’s business, helped the Jews; because the"

Esther,9,11,On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the castle was brought before the king.
Esther,9,12,"And the king said unto Esther the queen: ‘The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the castle, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now whatever thy petition, it shall be granted thee; and whatever thy request further, it"
Esther,9,13,"Then said Esther: ‘If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged"
Esther,9,14,And the king commanded it so to be done; and a decree was given out in Shushan;
Esther,9,15,"And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand."
Esther,9,16,"And the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand—but on the spoil they laid not their hand— 17on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. The Feast of Purim Instituted"
Esther,9,18,"But the Jews that were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting"
Esther,9,19,"Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another."
Esther,9,20,"And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far, 21to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, 22the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor."
Esther,9,23,"And the Jews took upon them to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them; 24because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast pur, that is, the lot, to discomfit them, and to destroy them; 25but when she came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head; and that he and his sons should be hanged"
Esther,9,26,"Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them, 27the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year; 28and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed."
Esther,9,29,"Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote down all the acts of"
Esther,9,30,"And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, 31to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings"
Esther,9,32,And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
Esther,10,1,"And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea."
Esther,10,2,"And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, how the king advanced"
Esther,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren; seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his seed."

Job,3,2,"And Job spoke, and said:"
Job,3,3,"Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night wherein it was said: ‘A man-child is brought forth.’"
Job,3,4,"Let that day be darkness; Let not God inquire after it from above, Neither let the light shine upon it."
Job,3,5,Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.
Job,3,6,"As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it; Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months."
Job,3,7,"Lo, let that night be desolate; Let no joyful voice come therein."

Job,3,11,Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not perish at birth?
Job,3,12,"Why did the knees receive me? And wherefore the breasts, that I should suck?"
Job,3,13,For now should I have lain still and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest—
Job,3,14,"With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;"
Job,3,15,"Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver;"
Job,3,16,Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; As infants that never saw light.

Job,3,25,"For the thing which I did fear is come upon me, And that which I was afraid of hath overtaken me."
Job,3,26,"I was not at ease, neither was I quiet, Neither had I rest; but trouble came."
Job,4,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:"
Job,4,2,"If one venture a word unto thee, wilt thou be weary? But who can withhold himself from speaking?"
Job,4,3,"Behold, thou hast instructed many, And thou hast strengthened the weak hands."
Job,4,4,"Thy words have upholden him that was falling, And thou hast strengthened the feeble knees."
Job,4,5,"But now it is come upon thee, and thou art weary; It toucheth thee, and thou art affrighted."
Job,4,6,"Is not thy fear of God thy confidence, And thy hope the integrity of thy ways?"
Job,4,7,"Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?"
Job,4,8,"According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, And sow mischief, reap the same."
Job,4,9,"By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of His anger are they consumed."
Job,4,10,"The lion roareth, and the fierce lion howleth—Yet the teeth of the young lions are broken."

Job,4,12,"Now a word was secretly brought to me, And mine ear received a whisper thereof."
Job,4,13,"In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falleth on men,"

Job,4,19,"How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth!"
Job,4,20,Betwixt morning and evening they are shattered; They perish for ever without any regarding it.
Job,4,21,"Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.’"
Job,5,1,Call now; is there any that will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?
Job,5,2,"For anger killeth the foolish man, And envy slayeth the silly one."
Job,5,3,I have seen the foolish taking root; But suddenly I beheld his habitation cursed.
Job,5,4,"His children are far from safety, And are crushed in the gate, with none to deliver them."
Job,5,5,"Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, And taketh it even out of the thorns, and the snare gapeth for their substance."
Job,5,6,"For affliction cometh not forth from the dust, Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;"
Job,5,7,"But man is born unto trouble, As the sparks fly upward."
Job,5,8,"But as for me, I would seek unto God, And unto God would I commit my cause;"
Job,5,9,"Who doeth great things and unsearchable, Marvellous things without number;"
Job,5,10,"Who giveth rain upon the earth, And sendeth waters upon the fields;"
Job,5,11,"So that He setteth up on high those that are low, And those that mourn are exalted to safety."
Job,5,12,"He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, So that their hands can perform nothing substantial."
Job,5,13,He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; And the counsel of the wily is carried headlong.
Job,5,14,"They meet with darkness in the day-time, And grope at noonday as in the night."
Job,5,15,"But He saveth from the sword of their mouth, Even the needy from the hand of the mighty."
Job,5,16,"So the poor hath hope, And iniquity stoppeth her mouth."
Job,5,17,"Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth; Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty."
Job,5,18,"For He maketh sore, and bindeth up; He woundeth, and His hands make whole."
Job,5,19,"He will deliver thee in six troubles; Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee."
Job,5,20,In famine He will redeem thee from death; And in war from the power of the sword.
Job,5,21,Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
Job,5,22,At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh; Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
Job,5,23,For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
Job,5,24,"And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; And thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt miss nothing."
Job,5,25,"Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, And thine offspring as the grass of the earth."
Job,5,26,"Thou shalt come to thy grave in a ripe age, Like as a shock of corn cometh in in its season."
Job,5,27,"Lo this, we have searched it, So it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good."
Job,6,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,6,2,"Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And my calamity laid in the balances altogether!"
Job,6,3,For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; Therefore are my words broken.
Job,6,4,"For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up; The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me."
Job,6,5,Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder?
Job,6,6,Can that which hath no savour be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the juice of mallows?
Job,6,7,My soul refuseth to touch them; They are as the sickness of my flesh.
Job,6,8,"Oh that I might have my request, And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!"
Job,6,9,"Even that it would please God to crush me; That He would let loose His hand, and cut me off!"
Job,6,10,"Then should I yet have comfort; Yea, I would exult in pain, though He spare not; For I have not denied the words of the Holy One."
Job,6,11,"What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient?"
Job,6,12,Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?
Job,6,13,"Is it that I have no help in me, And that sound wisdom is driven quite from me?"
Job,6,14,"To him that is ready to faint kindness is due from his friend, Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty."
Job,6,15,"My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that overflow,"
Job,6,16,"Which are black by reason of the ice, And wherein the snow hideth itself;"
Job,6,17,"What time they wax warm, they vanish, When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place."
Job,6,18,"The paths of their way do wind, They go up into the waste, and are lost."
Job,6,19,"The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them—"
Job,6,20,"They were ashamed because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded."
Job,6,21,"For now ye are become His; Ye see a terror, and are afraid."
Job,6,22,Did I say: ‘Give unto me’? Or: ‘Offer a present for me of your substance’ ? 23or: ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand’? Or: ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors’ ?
Job,6,24,"Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred."
Job,6,25,How forcible are words of uprightness! But what doth your arguing argue?
Job,6,26,"Do ye hold words to be an argument, But the speeches of one that is desperate to be wind?"
Job,6,27,"Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, And dig a pit for your friend."
Job,6,28,Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face.
Job,6,29,"Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous."
Job,6,30,Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern crafty devices?
Job,7,1,Is there not a time of service to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling?
Job,7,2,"As a servant that eagerly longeth for the shadow, And as a hireling that looketh for his wages;"
Job,7,3,"So am I made to possess—months of vanity, And wearisome nights are appointed to me."
Job,7,4,"When I lie down, I say: ‘When shall I arise?’ But the night is long, and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day."
Job,7,5,My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; My skin closeth up and breaketh out afresh.
Job,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, And are spent without hope."
Job,7,7,O remember that my life is a breath; Mine eye shall no more see good.
Job,7,8,"The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more; While Thine eyes are upon me, I am gone."
Job,7,9,"As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, So he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more."
Job,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house, Neither shall his place know him any more."
Job,7,11,Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,7,12,"Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That Thou settest a watch over me?"
Job,7,13,"When I say: ‘My bed shall comfort me, My couch shall ease my complaint’;"
Job,7,14,"Then Thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me through visions;"
Job,7,15,"So that my soul chooseth strangling, And death rather than these my bones."
Job,7,16,I loathe it; I shall not live alway; Let me alone; for my days are vanity.
Job,7,17,"What is man, that Thou shouldest magnify him, And that Thou shouldest set Thy heart upon him,"
Job,7,18,"And that Thou shouldest remember him every morning, And try him every moment?"
Job,7,19,"How long wilt Thou not look away from me, Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?"
Job,7,20,"If I have sinned, what do I unto Thee, O Thou watcher of men? Why hast Thou set me as a mark for Thee, So that I am a burden to myself?"
Job,7,21,"And why dost Thou not pardon my transgression, And take away mine iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; And Thou wilt seek me, but I shall not be."
Job,8,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:"
Job,8,2,"How long wilt thou speak these things, Seeing that the words of thy mouth are as a mighty wind?"
Job,8,3,Doth God pervert judgment? Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
Job,8,4,"If thy children sinned against Him, He delivered them into the hand of their transgression."
Job,8,5,"If thou wouldest seek earnestly unto God, And make thy supplication to the Almighty;"
Job,8,6,"If thou wert pure and upright; Surely now He would awake for thee, And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous."
Job,8,7,"And though thy beginning was small, Yet thy end should greatly increase."
Job,8,8,"For inquire, I pray thee, of the former generation, And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out—"
Job,8,9,"For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days upon earth are a shadow—"
Job,8,10,"Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, And utter words out of their heart?"
Job,8,11,Can the rush shoot up without mire? Can the reed-grass grow without water?
Job,8,12,"Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, It withereth before any other herb."
Job,8,13,So are the paths of all that forget God; And the hope of the godless man shall perish;
Job,8,14,"Whose confidence is gossamer, And whose trust is a spider’s web."
Job,8,15,"He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure."
Job,8,16,"He is green before the sun, And his shoots go forth over his garden."
Job,8,17,"His roots are wrapped about the heap, He beholdeth the place of stones."
Job,8,18,"If he be destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him: ‘I have not seen thee.’"
Job,8,19,"Behold, this is the joy of his way, And out of the earth shall others spring."
Job,8,20,"Behold, God will not cast away an innocent man, Neither will He uphold the evil-doers;"
Job,8,21,"Till He fill thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with shouting."
Job,8,22,They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.
Job,9,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,9,2,Of a truth I know that it is so; And how can man be just with God?
Job,9,3,"If one should desire to contend with Him, He could not answer Him one of a thousand."
Job,9,4,"He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength; Who hath hardened himself against Him, and prospered?"
Job,9,5,"Who removeth the mountains, and they know it not, When He overturneth them in His anger."
Job,9,6,"Who shaketh the earth out of her place, And the pillars thereof tremble."
Job,9,7,"Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; And sealeth up the stars."
Job,9,8,"Who alone stretcheth out the heavens, And treadeth upon the waves of the sea."
Job,9,9,"Who maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south."
Job,9,10,"Who doeth great things past finding out; Yea, marvellous things without number."
Job,9,11,"Lo, He goeth by me, and I see Him not. He passeth on also, but I perceive Him not."
Job,9,12,"Behold, He snatcheth away, who can hinder Him? Who will say unto Him: ‘What doest Thou?’"
Job,9,13,God will not withdraw His anger; The helpers of Rahab did stoop under Him.
Job,9,14,"How much less shall I answer Him, And choose out my arguments with Him?"
Job,9,15,"Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to Him that contendeth with me."
Job,9,16,"If I had called, and He had answered me; Yet would I not believe that He would hearken unto my voice—"
Job,9,17,"He that would break me with a tempest, And multiply my wounds without cause;"
Job,9,18,"That would not suffer me to take my breath, But fill me with bitterness."
Job,9,19,"If it be a matter of strength, lo, He is mighty! And if of justice, who will appoint me a time?"
Job,9,20,"Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me; Though I be innocent, He shall prove me perverse."
Job,9,21,"I am innocent—I regard not myself, I despise my life."
Job,9,22,It is all one—therefore I say: He destroyeth the innocent and the wicked.
Job,9,23,"If the scourge slay suddenly, He will mock at the calamity of the guiltless."
Job,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covereth the faces of the judges thereof; If it be not He, who then is it?"
Job,9,25,"Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good."
Job,9,26,They are passed away as the swift ships; As the vulture that swoopeth on the prey.
Job,9,27,"If I say: ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer’,"
Job,9,28,"I am afraid of all my pains, I know that Thou wilt not hold me guiltless."
Job,9,29,I shall be condemned; Why then do I labour in vain?
Job,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow water, And make my hands never so clean;"
Job,9,31,"Yet wilt Thou plunge me in the ditch, And mine own clothes shall abhor me."
Job,9,32,"For He is not a man, as I am, that I should answer Him, That we should come together in judgment."
Job,9,33,"There is no arbiter betwixt us, That might lay his hand upon us both."
Job,9,34,"Let Him take His rod away from me, And let not His terror make me afraid;"
Job,9,35,"Then would I speak, and not fear Him; For I am not so with myself."
Job,10,1,My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,10,2,I will say unto God: Do not condemn me; Make me know wherefore Thou contendest with me.
Job,10,3,"Is it good unto Thee that Thou shouldest oppress, That Thou shouldest despise the work of Thy hands, And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,Hast Thou eyes of flesh? Or seest Thou as man seeth?
Job,10,5,"Are Thy days as the days of man, Or Thy years as a man’s days,"
Job,10,6,"That Thou inquirest after mine iniquity, And searchest after my sin,"
Job,10,7,Although Thou knowest that I shall not be condemned; And there is none that can deliver out of Thy hand?
Job,10,8,Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me Together round about; yet Thou dost destroy me!
Job,10,9,"Remember, I beseech Thee, that Thou hast fashioned me as clay; And wilt Thou bring me into dust again?"
Job,10,10,"Hast Thou not poured me out as milk, And curdled me like cheese?"
Job,10,11,"Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews."
Job,10,12,"Thou hast granted me life and favour, And Thy providence hath preserved my spirit."
Job,10,13,Yet these things Thou didst hide in Thy heart; I know that this is with Thee;
Job,10,14,"If I sin, then Thou markest me, And Thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity."
Job,10,15,"If I be wicked, woe unto me; And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head—Being filled with ignominy And looking upon mine affliction."
Job,10,16,"And if it exalt itself, Thou huntest me as a lion; And again Thou showest Thyself marvellous upon me."
Job,10,17,"Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me, And increasest Thine indignation upon me; Host succeeding host against me."
Job,10,18,"Wherefore then hast Thou brought me forth out of the womb? Would that I had perished, and no eye had seen me!"
Job,10,19,I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job,10,20,"Are not my days few? Cease then, And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,"
Job,10,21,"Before I go whence I shall not return, Even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;"
Job,10,22,"A land of thick darkness, as darkness itself; A land of the shadow of death, without any order, And where the light is as darkness."
Job,11,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:"
Job,11,2,Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be accounted right?
Job,11,3,"Thy boastings have made men hold their peace, And thou hast mocked, with none to make thee ashamed;"
Job,11,4,"And thou hast said: ‘My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in Thine eyes.’"
Job,11,5,"But oh that God would speak, And open His lips against thee;"
Job,11,6,"And that He would tell thee the secrets of wisdom, That sound wisdom is manifold! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth."
Job,11,7,Canst thou find out the deep things of God? Canst thou attain unto the purpose of the Almighty?
Job,11,8,It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than the nether-world; what canst thou know?
Job,11,9,"The measure thereof is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea."
Job,11,10,"If He pass by, and shut up, Or gather in, then who can hinder Him?"
Job,11,11,"For He knoweth base men; And when He seeth iniquity, will He not then consider it?"
Job,11,12,"But an empty man will get understanding, When a wild ass’s colt is born a man."
Job,11,13,"If thou set thy heart aright, And stretch out thy hands toward Him—"
Job,11,14,"If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents—"
Job,11,15,"Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear;"
Job,11,16,For thou shalt forget thy misery; Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away;
Job,11,17,"And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday; Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning."
Job,11,18,"And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; Yea, thou shalt look about thee, and shalt take thy rest in safety."
Job,11,19,"Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; Yea, many shall make suit unto thee."
Job,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, And they shall have no way to flee, And their hope shall be the drooping of the soul."
Job,12,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,12,2,"No doubt but ye are the people, And wisdom shall die with you."
Job,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you; Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?"
Job,12,4,"I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbour, A man that called upon God, And He answered him; The just, the innocent man is a laughing-stock,"
Job,12,5,"A contemptible brand in the thought of him that is at ease, A thing ready for them whose foot slippeth."
Job,12,6,"The tents of robbers prosper, And they that provoke God are secure, In whatsoever God bringeth into their hand."
Job,12,7,"But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee;"
Job,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee;"
Job,12,9,"Who knoweth not among all these, That the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?"
Job,12,10,"In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind.—"
Job,12,11,"Doth not the ear try words, Even as the palate tasteth its food?"
Job,12,12,"Is wisdom with aged men, And understanding in length of days?—"
Job,12,13,With Him is wisdom and might; He hath counsel and understanding.
Job,12,14,"Behold, He breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening."
Job,12,15,"Behold, He withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; Also He sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth."
Job,12,16,With Him is strength and sound wisdom; The deceived and the deceiver are His.
Job,12,17,"He leadeth counsellors away stripped, And judges maketh He fools."
Job,12,18,"He looseth the bond of kings, And bindeth their loins with a girdle."
Job,12,19,"He leadeth priests away stripped, And overthroweth the mighty."
Job,12,20,"He removeth the speech of men of trust, And taketh away the sense of the elders."
Job,12,21,"He poureth contempt upon princes, And looseth the belt of the strong."
Job,12,22,"He uncovereth deep things out of darkness, And bringeth out to light the shadow of death."
Job,12,23,"He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them; He enlargeth the nations, and leadeth them away."
Job,12,24,"He taketh away the heart of the chiefs of the people of the land, And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way."
Job,12,25,"They grope in the dark without light, And He maketh them to stagger like a drunken man."
Job,13,1,"Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, Mine ear hath heard and understood it."
Job,13,2,"What ye know, do I know also; I am not inferior unto you."
Job,13,3,"Notwithstanding I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God."
Job,13,4,"But ye are plasterers of lies, Ye are all physicians of no value."
Job,13,5,Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! And it would be your wisdom.
Job,13,6,"Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the pleadings of my lips."
Job,13,7,"Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for Him?"
Job,13,8,Will ye show Him favour? Will ye contend for God?
Job,13,9,"Would it be good that He should search you out? Or as one mocketh a man, will ye mock Him?"
Job,13,10,"He will surely reprove you, If ye do secretly show favour."
Job,13,11,"Shall not His majesty terrify you, And His dread fall upon you?"
Job,13,12,"Your memorials shall be like unto ashes, Your eminences to eminences of clay."
Job,13,13,"Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, And let come on me what will."
Job,13,14,"Wherefore? I will take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand."
Job,13,15,"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him; But I will argue my ways before Him."
Job,13,16,"This also shall be my salvation, That a hypocrite cannot come before Him."
Job,13,17,"Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your ears."
Job,13,18,"Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified."
Job,13,19,Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and die.
Job,13,20,"Only do not two things unto me, Then will I not hide myself from Thee:"
Job,13,21,Withdraw Thy hand far from me; And let not Thy terror make me afraid.
Job,13,22,"Then call Thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer Thou me."
Job,13,23,How many are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin.
Job,13,24,"Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, And holdest me for Thine enemy?"
Job,13,25,Wilt Thou harass a driven leaf? And wilt Thou pursue the dry stubble?
Job,13,26,"That Thou shouldest write bitter things against me, And make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth."
Job,13,27,"Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, And lookest narrowly unto all my paths; Thou drawest Thee a line about the soles of my feet;"
Job,13,28,"Though I am like a wine-skin that consumeth, Like a garment that is moth-eaten."
Job,14,1,"Man that is born of a woman Is of few days, and full of trouble."
Job,14,2,"He cometh forth like a flower, and withereth; He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not."
Job,14,3,"And dost Thou open Thine eyes upon such a one, And bringest me into judgment with Thee?"
Job,14,4,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
Job,14,5,"Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with Thee, And Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;"
Job,14,6,"Look away from him, that he may rest, Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day."
Job,14,7,"For there is hope of a tree, If it be cut down, that it will sprout again, And that the tender branch thereof will not cease."
Job,14,8,"Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, And the stock thereof die in the ground;"
Job,14,9,"Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant."
Job,14,10,"But man dieth, and lieth low; Yea, man perisheth, and where is he?"
Job,14,11,"As the waters fail from the sea, And the river is drained dry;"
Job,14,12,"So man lieth down and riseth not; Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, Nor be roused out of their sleep."
Job,14,13,"Oh that Thou wouldest hide me in the nether-world, That Thou wouldest keep me secret, until Thy wrath be past, That Thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!—"
Job,14,14,"If a man die, may he live again? All the days of my service would I wait, till my relief should come—"
Job,14,15,"Thou wouldest call, and I would answer Thee; Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of Thy hands."
Job,14,16,"But now Thou numberest my steps, Thou dost not even wait for my sin;"
Job,14,17,"My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And Thou heapest up mine iniquity."
Job,14,18,"And surely the mountain falling crumbleth away, And the rock is removed out of its place;"
Job,14,19,The waters wear the stones; The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth; So Thou destroyest the hope of man.
Job,14,20,"Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth; Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away."
Job,14,21,"His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; And they are brought low, but he regardeth them not."
Job,14,22,"But his flesh grieveth for him, And his soul mourneth over him."
Job,15,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:"
Job,15,2,"Should a wise man make answer with windy knowledge, And fill his belly with the east wind?"
Job,15,3,"Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?"
Job,15,4,"Yea, thou doest away with fear, And impairest devotion before God."
Job,15,5,"For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty."
Job,15,6,"Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; Yea, thine own lips testify against thee."
Job,15,7,Art thou the first man that was born? Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?
Job,15,8,Dost thou hearken in the council of God? And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
Job,15,9,"What knowest thou, that we know not? What understandest thou, which is not in us?"
Job,15,10,"With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, Much older than thy father."
Job,15,11,"Are the consolations of God too small for thee, And the word that dealeth gently with thee?"
Job,15,12,Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes wink?
Job,15,13,"That thou turnest thy spirit against God, And lettest such words go out of thy mouth."
Job,15,14,"What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
Job,15,15,"Behold, He putteth no trust in His holy ones; Yea, the heavens are not clean in His sight."
Job,15,16,"How much less one that is abominable and impure, Man who drinketh iniquity like water!"
Job,15,17,"I will tell thee, hear thou me; And that which I have seen I will declare—"
Job,15,18,"Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hid it;"
Job,15,19,"Unto whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them."
Job,15,20,"The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor."
Job,15,21,A sound of terrors is in his ears: In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
Job,15,22,"He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, And he is waited for of the sword."
Job,15,23,He wandereth abroad for bread: ‘Where is it?’ He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
Job,15,24,"Distress and anguish overwhelm him; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle."
Job,15,25,"Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;"
Job,15,26,"He runneth upon him with a stiff neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers."
Job,15,27,"Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, And made collops of fat on his loins;"
Job,15,28,"And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, In houses which no man would inhabit, Which were ready to become heaps."
Job,15,29,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, Neither shall their produce bend to the earth."
Job,15,30,"He shall not depart out of darkness; The flame shall dry up his branches, And by the breath of His mouth shall he go away."
Job,15,31,"Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; For vanity shall be his recompense."
Job,15,32,"It shall be accomplished before his time, And his branch shall not be leafy."
Job,15,33,"He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And shall cast off his flower as the olive."
Job,15,34,"For the company of the godless shall be desolate, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery."
Job,15,35,"They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, And their belly prepareth deceit."
Job,16,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,16,2,I have heard many such things; Sorry comforters are ye all.
Job,16,3,Shall windy words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?
Job,16,4,"I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you."
Job,16,5,"I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the moving of my lips would assuage your grief."
Job,16,6,"Though I speak, my pain is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?"
Job,16,7,But now He hath made me weary; Thou hast made desolate all my company.
Job,16,8,"And Thou hast shrivelled me up, which is a witness against me; And my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face."
Job,16,9,"He hath torn me in His wrath, and hated me; He hath gnashed upon me with His teeth; Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me."
Job,16,10,They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek scornfully; They gather themselves together against me.
Job,16,11,"God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked."
Job,16,12,"I was at ease, and He broke me asunder; Yea, He hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces; He hath also set me up for His mark."
Job,16,13,"His archers compass me round about, He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground."
Job,16,14,He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant.
Job,16,15,"I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust."
Job,16,16,"My face is reddened with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;"
Job,16,17,"Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure."
Job,16,18,"O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no resting-place."
Job,16,19,"Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven, And He that testifieth of me is on high."
Job,16,20,"Mine inward thoughts are my intercessors, Mine eye poureth out tears unto God;"
Job,16,21,"That He would set aright a man contending with God, As a son of man setteth aright his neighbour!"
Job,16,22,"For the years that are few are coming on, And I shall go the way whence I shall not return."
Job,17,1,"My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is ready for me."
Job,17,2,"Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye abideth in their provocation."
Job,17,3,"Give now a pledge, be surety for me with Thyself; Who else is there that will strike hands with me?"
Job,17,4,For Thou hast hid their heart from understanding; Therefore shalt Thou not exalt them.
Job,17,5,"He that denounceth his friends for the sake of flattery, Even the eyes of his children shall fail."
Job,17,6,He hath made me also a byword of the people; And I am become one in whose face they spit.
Job,17,7,"Mine eye also is dimmed by reason of vexation, And all my members are as a shadow."
Job,17,8,"Upright men are astonished at this, And the innocent stirreth up himself against the godless."
Job,17,9,"Yet the righteous holdeth on his way, And he that hath clean hands waxeth stronger and stronger."
Job,17,10,"But as for you all, do ye return, and come now; And I shall not find a wise man among you."
Job,17,11,"My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart."
Job,17,12,They change the night into day; The light is short because of darkness.
Job,17,13,If I look for the nether-world as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness;
Job,17,14,"If I have said to corruption: ‘Thou art my father’, To the worm: ‘Thou art my mother, and my sister’;"
Job,17,15,"Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?"
Job,17,16,"They shall go down to the bars of the nether-world, When we are at rest together in the dust."
Job,18,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:"
Job,18,2,"How long will ye lay snares for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak."
Job,18,3,"Wherefore are we counted as beasts, And reputed dull in your sight?"
Job,18,4,"Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?"
Job,18,5,"Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the spark of his fire shall not shine."
Job,18,6,"The light shall be dark in his tent, And his lamp over him shall be put out."
Job,18,7,"The steps of his strength shall be straitened, And his own counsel shall cast him down."
Job,18,8,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walketh upon the toils."
Job,18,9,"A gin shall take him by the heel, And a snare shall lay hold on him."
Job,18,10,"A noose is hid for him in the ground, And a trap for him in the way."
Job,18,11,"Terrors shall overwhelm him on every side, And shall entrap him at his feet."
Job,18,12,"His trouble shall be ravenous, And calamity shall be ready for his fall."
Job,18,13,"It shall devour the members of his body, Yea, the first-born of death shall devour his members."
Job,18,14,That wherein he trusteth shall be plucked out of his tent; And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.
Job,18,15,There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his; Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
Job,18,16,"His roots shall dry up beneath, And above shall his branch wither."
Job,18,17,"His remembrance shall perish from the earth, And he shall have no name abroad."
Job,18,18,"He shall be driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world."
Job,18,19,"He shall have neither son nor son’s son among his people, Nor any remaining in his dwellings."
Job,18,20,"They that come after shall be astonished at his day, As they that went before are affrighted."
Job,18,21,"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him that knoweth not God."
Job,19,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,19,2,"How long will ye vex my soul, And crush me with words?"
Job,19,3,These ten times have ye reproached me; Ye are not ashamed that ye deal harshly with me.
Job,19,4,"And be it indeed that I have erred, Mine error remaineth with myself."
Job,19,5,"If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, And plead against me my reproach;"
Job,19,6,"Know now that God hath subverted my cause, And hath compassed me with His net."
Job,19,7,"Behold, I cry out: ‘Violence!’ but I am not heard; I cry aloud, but there is no justice."
Job,19,8,"He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, And hath set darkness in my paths."
Job,19,9,"He hath stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head."
Job,19,10,"He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone; And my hope hath He plucked up like a tree."
Job,19,11,"He hath also kindled His wrath against me, And He counteth me unto Him as one of His adversaries."
Job,19,12,"His troops come on together, And cast up their way against me, And encamp round about my tent."
Job,19,13,"He hath put my brethren far from me, And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me."
Job,19,14,"My kinsfolk have failed, And my familiar friends have forgotten me."
Job,19,15,"They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger; I am become an alien in their sight."
Job,19,16,"I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer, Though I entreat him with my mouth."
Job,19,17,"My breath is abhorred of my wife, And I am loathsome to the children of my tribe."
Job,19,18,"Even urchins despised me; If I arise, they speak against me."
Job,19,19,All my intimate friends abhor me; And they whom I loved are turned against me.
Job,19,20,"My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth."
Job,19,21,"Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; For the hand of God hath touched me."
Job,19,22,"Why do ye persecute me as God, And are not satisfied with my flesh?"
Job,19,23,Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
Job,19,24,That with an iron pen and lead They were graven in the rock for ever!
Job,19,25,"But as for me, I know that my Redeemer liveth, And that He will witness at the last upon the dust;"
Job,19,26,"And when after my skin this is destroyed, Then without my flesh shall I see God;"
Job,19,27,"Whom I, even I, shall see for myself, And mine eyes shall behold, and not another’s. My reins are consumed within me."
Job,19,28,If ye say: ‘How we will persecute him!’ Seeing that the root of the matter is found in me;
Job,19,29,"Be ye afraid of the sword; For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, That ye may know there is a judgment."
Job,20,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:"
Job,20,2,"Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, Even by reason of mine agitation that is in me."
Job,20,3,"I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame, But out of my understanding my spirit answereth me."
Job,20,4,"Knowest thou not this of old time, Since man was placed upon earth,"
Job,20,5,"That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment?"
Job,20,6,"Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, And his head reach unto the clouds;"
Job,20,7,Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung; They that have seen him shall say: ‘Where is he?’
Job,20,8,"He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found; Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night."
Job,20,9,The eye which saw him shall see him no more; Neither shall his place any more behold him.
Job,20,10,"His children shall appease the poor, And his hands shall restore his wealth."
Job,20,11,"His bones are full of his youth, But it shall lie down with him in the dust."
Job,20,12,"Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue;"
Job,20,13,"Though he spare it, and will not let it go, But keep it still within his mouth;"
Job,20,14,"Yet his food in his bowels is turned, It is the gall of asps within him."
Job,20,15,"He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God shall cast them out of his belly."
Job,20,16,He shall suck the poison of asps; The viper’s tongue shall slay him.
Job,20,17,"He shall not look upon the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and curd."
Job,20,18,"That which he laboured for shall he give back, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice."
Job,20,19,"For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up."
Job,20,20,"Because he knew no quietness within him, In his greed he suffered nought to escape,"
Job,20,21,There was nothing left that he devoured not—Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.
Job,20,22,In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits; The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.
Job,20,23,"It shall be for the filling of his belly; He shall cast the fierceness of His wrath upon him, And shall cause it to rain upon him into his flesh."
Job,20,24,"If he flee from the iron weapon, The bow of brass shall strike him through."
Job,20,25,"He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall; Terrors are upon him."
Job,20,26,All darkness is laid up for his treasures; A fire not blown by man shall consume him; It shall go ill with him that is left in his tent.
Job,20,27,"The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, And the earth shall rise up against him."
Job,20,28,"The increase of his house shall depart, His goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath."
Job,20,29,"This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the heritage appointed unto him by God."
Job,21,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,21,2,Hear diligently my speech; And let this be your consolations.
Job,21,3,"Suffer me, that I may speak; And after that I have spoken, mock on."
Job,21,4,"As for me, is my complaint to man? Or why should I not be impatient?"
Job,21,5,"Turn unto me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth."
Job,21,6,"Even when I remember I am affrighted, And horror hath taketh hold on my flesh."
Job,21,7,"Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?"
Job,21,8,"Their seed is established in their sight with them, And their offspring before their eyes."
Job,21,9,"Their houses are safe, without fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them."
Job,21,10,"Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf."
Job,21,11,"They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance."
Job,21,12,"They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe."
Job,21,13,"They spend their days in prosperity, And peacefully they go down to the grave."
Job,21,14,Yet they said unto God: ‘Depart from us; For we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.
Job,21,15,"What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?’—"
Job,21,16,"Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand; The counsel of the wicked is far from me."
Job,21,17,How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That He distributeth pains in His anger?
Job,21,18,"That they are as stubble before the wind, And as chaff that the storm stealeth away?"
Job,21,19,"God layeth up his iniquity for his children!’—Let Him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it."
Job,21,20,"Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
Job,21,21,For what pleasure hath he in his house after him? Seeing the number of his months is determined.
Job,21,22,Shall any teach God knowledge? Seeing it is He that judgeth those that are high.
Job,21,23,"One dieth in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet;"
Job,21,24,"His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moistened."
Job,21,25,"And another dieth in bitterness of soul, And hath never tasted of good."
Job,21,26,"They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covereth them."
Job,21,27,"Behold, I know your thoughts, And the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me."
Job,21,28,For ye say: ‘Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?’
Job,21,29,"Have ye not asked them that go by the way; And will ye misdeem their tokens,"
Job,21,30,"That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, That they are led forth to the day of wrath?"
Job,21,31,But who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done?
Job,21,32,"For he is borne to the grave, And watch is kept over his tomb."
Job,21,33,"The clods of the valley are sweet unto him, And all men draw after him, As there were innumerable before him."
Job,21,34,"How then comfort ye me in vain? And as for your answers, there remaineth only faithlessness?"
Job,22,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:"
Job,22,2,Can a man be profitable unto God? Or can he that is wise be profitable unto Him?
Job,22,3,"Is it any advantage to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it gain to Him, that thou makest thy ways blameless?"
Job,22,4,"Is it for thy fear of Him that He reproveth thee, That He entereth with thee into judgment?"
Job,22,5,Is not thy wickedness great? And are not thine iniquities without end?
Job,22,6,"For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, And stripped the naked of their clothing."
Job,22,7,"Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry."
Job,22,8,"And as a mighty man, who hath the earth, And as a man of rank, who dwelleth in it,"
Job,22,9,"Thou hast sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken."
Job,22,10,"Therefore snares are round about thee, And sudden dread affrighted thee,"
Job,22,11,"Or darkness, that thou canst not see, And abundance of waters cover thee."
Job,22,12,"Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the topmost of the stars, how high they are!"
Job,22,13,And thou sayest: ‘What doth God know? Can He judge through the dark cloud?
Job,22,14,"Thick clouds are a covering to Him, that He seeth not; And He walketh in the circuit of heaven.’"
Job,22,15,Wilt thou keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden?
Job,22,16,"Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream;"
Job,22,17,Who said unto God: ‘Depart from us’; And what could the Almighty do unto them?
Job,22,18,Yet He filled their houses with good things—But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job,22,19,"The righteous saw it, and were glad, And the innocent laugh them to scorn:"
Job,22,20,"Surely their substance is cut off, And their abundance the fire hath consumed.’"
Job,22,21,"Acquaint now thyself with Him, and be at peace; Thereby shall thine increase be good."
Job,22,22,"Receive, I pray thee, instruction from His mouth, And lay up His words in thy heart."
Job,22,23,"If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up—If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents,"
Job,22,24,"And lay thy treasure in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks;"
Job,22,25,"And the Almighty be thy treasure, And precious silver unto thee;"
Job,22,26,"Then surely shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, And shalt lift up thy face unto God."
Job,22,27,"Thou shalt make thy prayer unto Him, and He will hear thee, And thou shalt pay thy vows;"
Job,22,28,"Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee, And light shall shine upon thy ways."
Job,22,29,"When they cast thee down, thou shalt say: ‘There is lifting up’; For the humble person He saveth."
Job,22,30,"He delivereth him that is innocent, Yea, thou shalt be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands."
Job,23,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,23,2,Even to-day is my complaint bitter; My hand is become heavy because of my groaning.
Job,23,3,"Oh that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come even to His seat!"
Job,23,4,"I would order my cause before Him, And fill my mouth with arguments."
Job,23,5,"I would know the words which He would answer me, And understand what He would say unto me."
Job,23,6,Would He contend with me in His great power? Nay; but He would give heed unto me.
Job,23,7,There the upright might reason with Him; So should I be delivered for ever from my Judge.
Job,23,8,"Behold, I go forward, but He is not there, And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;"
Job,23,9,"On the left hand, when He doth work, but I cannot behold Him, He turneth Himself to the right hand, but I cannot see Him."
Job,23,10,"For He knoweth the way that I take; When He hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold."
Job,23,11,"My foot hath held fast to His steps, His way have I kept, and turned not aside."
Job,23,12,I have not gone back from the commandment of His lips; I have treasured up the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.
Job,23,13,"But He is at one with Himself, and who can turn Him? And what His soul desireth, even that He doeth."
Job,23,14,For He will perform that which is appointed for me; And many such things are with Him.
Job,23,15,"Therefore am I affrighted at His presence; When I consider, I am afraid of Him."
Job,23,16,"Yea, God hath made my heart faint, And the Almighty hath affrighted me;"
Job,23,17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Neither did He cover the thick darkness from my face."
Job,24,1,Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? And why do not they that know Him see His days?
Job,24,2,"There are that remove the landmarks; They violently take away flocks, and feed them."
Job,24,3,"They drive away the ass of the fatherless, They take the widow’s ox for a pledge."
Job,24,4,They turn the needy out of the way; The poor of the earth hide themselves together.
Job,24,5,"Behold, as wild asses in the wilderness They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The desert yieldeth them bread for their children."
Job,24,6,They cut his provender in the field; And they despoil the vineyard of the wicked.
Job,24,7,"They lie all night naked without clothing, And have no covering in the cold."
Job,24,8,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And embrace the rock for want of a shelter."
Job,24,9,"There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge of the poor;"
Job,24,10,"So that they go about naked without clothing, And being hungry they carry the sheaves;"
Job,24,11,"They make oil within the rows of these men; They tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst."
Job,24,12,"From out of the populous city men groan, And the soul of the wounded crieth out; Yet God imputeth it not for unseemliness."
Job,24,13,"These are of them that rebel against the light; They know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof."
Job,24,14,"The murderer riseth with the light, to kill the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief."
Job,24,15,"The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, Saying: ‘No eye shall see me’; And he putteth a covering on his face."
Job,24,16,In the dark they dig through houses; They shut themselves up in the day-time; They know not the light.
Job,24,17,For the shadow of death is to all of them as the morning; For they know the terrors of the shadow of death.
Job,24,18,He is swift upon the face of the waters; Their portion is cursed in the earth; He turneth not by the way of the vineyards.
Job,24,19,Drought and heat consume the snow waters; So doth the nether-world those that have sinned.
Job,24,20,The womb forgetteth him; the worm feedeth sweetly on him; He shall be no more remembered; And unrighteousness is broken as a tree.
Job,24,21,He devoureth the barren that beareth not; And doeth not good to the widow.
Job,24,22,"He draweth away the mighty also by his power; He riseth up, and he trusteth not his own life."
Job,24,23,"Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth, Yet His eyes are upon their ways."
Job,24,24,"They are exalted for a little while, and they are gone; Yea, they are brought low, they are gathered in as all others, And wither as the tops of the ears of corn."
Job,24,25,"And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech nothing worth?"
Job,25,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:"
Job,25,2,Dominion and fear are with Him; He maketh peace in His high places.
Job,25,3,Is there any number of His armies? And upon whom doth not His light arise?
Job,25,4,How then can man be just with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
Job,25,5,"Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, And the stars are not pure in His sight;"
Job,25,6,"How much less man, that is a worm! And the son of man, that is a maggot!"
Job,26,1,Then Job answered and said:
Job,26,2,How hast thou helped him that is without power! How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!
Job,26,3,"How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, And plentifully declared sound knowledge!"
Job,26,4,With whose help hast thou uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from thee?
Job,26,5,The shades tremble Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.
Job,26,6,"The nether-world is naked before Him, And Destruction hath no covering."
Job,26,7,"He stretcheth out the north over the empty space, And hangeth the earth over nothing."
Job,26,8,He bindeth up the waters in His thick clouds; And the cloud is not rent under them.
Job,26,9,"He closeth in the face of His throne, And spreadeth His cloud upon it."
Job,26,10,"He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, Unto the confines of light and darkness."
Job,26,11,The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at His rebuke.
Job,26,12,"He stirreth up the sea with His power, And by His understanding He smiteth through Rahab."
Job,26,13,By His breath the heavens are serene; His hand hath pierced the slant serpent.
Job,26,14,"Lo, these are but the outskirts of His ways; And how small a whisper is heard of Him! But the thunder of His mighty deeds who can understand?"
Job,27,1,"And Job again took up his parable, and said:"
Job,27,2,"As God liveth, who hath taken away my right; And the Almighty, who hath dealt bitterly with me;"
Job,27,3,"All the while my breath is in me And the spirit of God is in my nostrils,"
Job,27,4,"Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit;"
Job,27,5,Far be it from me that I should justify you; Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.
Job,27,6,"My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go; My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. The Wicked Man’s Portion"
Job,27,7,"Let mine enemy be as the wicked, And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous."
Job,27,8,"For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain, When God taketh away his soul?"
Job,27,9,"Will God hear his cry, When trouble cometh upon him?"
Job,27,10,"Will he have his delight in the Almighty, And call upon God at all times?"
Job,27,11,I will teach you concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
Job,27,12,"Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; Why then are ye become altogether vain?"
Job,27,13,"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty."
Job,27,14,"If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not have bread enough."
Job,27,15,"Those that remain of him shall be buried by pestilence, And his widows shall make no lamentation."
Job,27,16,"Though he heap up silver as the dust, And prepare raiment as the clay;"
Job,27,17,"He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, And the innocent shall divide the silver."
Job,27,18,"He buildeth his house as a moth, And as a booth which the keeper maketh."
Job,27,19,"He lieth down rich, but there shall be nought to gather; He openeth his eyes, and his wealth is not."
Job,27,20,Terrors overtake him like waters; A tempest stealeth him away in the night.
Job,27,21,"The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth; And it sweepeth him out of his place."
Job,27,22,"Yea, it hurleth at him, and spareth not; He would fain flee from its power."
Job,27,23,"Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place."
Job,28,1,"For there is a mine for silver, And a place for gold which they refine."
Job,28,2,"Iron is taken out of the dust, And brass is molten out of the stone."
Job,28,3,"Man setteth an end to darkness, And searcheth out to the furthest bound The stones of thick darkness and of the shadow of death."
Job,28,4,"He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; They are forgotten of the foot that passeth by; They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro."
Job,28,5,"As for the earth, out of it cometh bread, And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire."
Job,28,6,"The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, And it hath dust of gold."
Job,28,7,"That path no bird of prey knoweth, Neither hath the falcon’s eye seen it;"
Job,28,8,"The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor hath the lion passed thereby."
Job,28,9,He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock; He overturneth the mountains by the roots.
Job,28,10,He cutteth out channels among the rocks; And his eye seeth every precious thing.
Job,28,11,He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
Job,28,12,"But wisdom, where shall it be found? And where is the place of understanding?"
Job,28,13,Man knoweth not the price thereof; Neither is it found in the land of the living.
Job,28,14,The deep saith: ‘It is not in me’; And the sea saith: ‘It is not with me.’
Job,28,15,"It cannot be gotten for gold, Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof."
Job,28,16,"It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, With the precious onyx, or the sapphire."
Job,28,17,Gold and glass cannot equal it; Neither shall the exchange thereof be vessels of fine gold.
Job,28,18,"No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies."
Job,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold."
Job,28,20,Whence then cometh wisdom? And where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,21,"Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, And kept close from the fowls of the air."
Job,28,22,Destruction and Death say: ‘We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears.’
Job,28,23,"God understandeth the way thereof, And He knoweth the place thereof."
Job,28,24,"For He looketh to the ends of the earth, And seeth under the whole heaven;"
Job,28,25,"When He maketh a weight for the wind, And meteth out the waters by measure."
Job,28,26,"When He made a decree for the rain, And a way for the storm of thunders;"
Job,28,27,"Then did He see it, and declare it; He established it, yea, and searched it out."
Job,28,28,"And unto man He said: ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.’"
Job,29,1,"And Job again took up his parable, and said:"
Job,29,2,"Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me;"
Job,29,3,"When His lamp shined above my head, And by His light I walked through darkness;"
Job,29,4,"As I was in the days of my youth, When the converse of God was upon my tent;"
Job,29,5,"When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me;"
Job,29,6,"When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out rivers of oil!"
Job,29,7,"When I went forth to the gate unto the city, When I prepared my seat in the broad place,"
Job,29,8,"The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood;"
Job,29,9,"The princes refrained talking, And laid their hand on their mouth;"
Job,29,10,"The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth."
Job,29,11,"For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me, And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me;"
Job,29,12,"Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him."
Job,29,13,The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
Job,29,14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed itself with me; My justice was as a robe and a diadem."
Job,29,15,"I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame."
Job,29,16,I was a father to the needy; And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.
Job,29,17,"And I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth."
Job,29,18,"Then I said: ‘I shall die with my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the phoenix;"
Job,29,19,"My root shall be spread out to the waters, And the dew shall lie all night upon my branch;"
Job,29,20,"My glory shall be fresh in me, And my bow shall be renewed in my hand.’"
Job,29,21,"Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel."
Job,29,22,After my words they spoke not again; And my speech dropped upon them.
Job,29,23,And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
Job,29,24,"If I laughed on them, they believed it not; And the light of my countenance they cast not down."
Job,29,25,"I chose out their way, and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners."
Job,30,1,"But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock."
Job,30,2,"Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? Men in whom ripe age is perished."
Job,30,3,"They are gaunt with want and famine; They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation."
Job,30,4,They pluck salt-wort with wormwood; And the roots of the broom are their food.
Job,30,5,They are driven forth from the midst of men; They cry after them as after a thief.
Job,30,6,"In the clefts of the valleys must they dwell, In holes of the earth and of the rocks."
Job,30,7,Among the bushes they bray; Under the nettles they are gathered together.
Job,30,8,"They are children of churls, yea, children of ignoble men; They were scourged out of the land."
Job,30,9,"And now I am become their song, Yea, I am a byword unto them."
Job,30,10,"They abhor me, they flee far from me, And spare not to spit in my face."
Job,30,11,"For He hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, And they have cast off the bridle before me."
Job,30,12,"Upon my right hand rise the brood; They entangle my feet, And they cast up against me their ways of destruction."
Job,30,13,"They break up my path, They further my calamity, Even men that have no helper."
Job,30,14,As through a wide breach they come; In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me. Job’s Prosperity Becomes Calamity
Job,30,15,"Terrors are turned upon me, They chase mine honour as the wind; And my welfare is passed away as a cloud."
Job,30,16,And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
Job,30,17,"In the night my bones are pierced, and fall from me, And my sinews take no rest."
Job,30,18,By the great force [of my disease] is my garment disfigured; It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
Job,30,19,"He hath cast me into the mire, And I am become like dust and ashes."
Job,30,20,"I cry unto Thee, and Thou dost not answer me; I stand up, and Thou lookest at me."
Job,30,21,Thou art turned to be cruel to me; With the might of Thy hand Thou hatest me.
Job,30,22,"Thou liftest me up to the wind, Thou causest me to ride upon it; And Thou dissolvest my substance."
Job,30,23,"For I know that Thou wilt bring me to death, And to the house appointed for all living."
Job,30,24,"Surely none shall put forth his hand to a ruinous heap, Neither because of these things shall help come in one’s calamity,"
Job,30,25,"If I have not wept for him that was in trouble, And if my soul grieved not for the needy."
Job,30,26,"Yet, when I looked for good, there came evil; And when I waited for light, there came darkness."
Job,30,27,"Mine inwards boil, and rest not; Days of affliction are come upon me."
Job,30,28,"I go mourning without the sun; I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help."
Job,30,29,"I am become a brother to jackals, And a companion to ostriches."
Job,30,30,"My skin is black, and falleth from me, And my bones are burned with heat."
Job,30,31,"Therefore is my harp turned to mourning, And my pipe into the voice of them that weep."
Job,31,1,I made a covenant with mine eyes; How then should I look upon a maid?
Job,31,2,"For what would be the portion of God from above, And the heritage of the Almighty from on high?"
Job,31,3,"Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, And disaster to the workers of iniquity?"
Job,31,4,"Doth not He see my ways, And count all my steps?"
Job,31,5,"If I have walked with vanity, And my foot hath hasted to deceit—"
Job,31,6,"Let me be weighed in a just balance, That God may know mine integrity—"
Job,31,7,"If my step hath turned out of the way, And my heart walked after mine eyes, And if any spot hath cleaved to my hands;"
Job,31,8,"Then let me sow, and let another eat; Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out."
Job,31,9,"If my heart have been enticed unto a woman, And I have lain in wait at my neighbour’s door;"
Job,31,10,"Then let my wife grind unto another, And let others bow down upon her."
Job,31,11,"For that were a heinous crime; Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges."
Job,31,12,"For it is a fire that consumeth unto destruction, And would root out all mine increase."
Job,31,13,"If I did despise the cause of my man-servant, Or of my maid-servant, when they contended with me—"
Job,31,14,"What then shall I do when God riseth up? And when He remembereth, what shall I answer Him?"
Job,31,15,Did not He that made me in the womb make him? And did not One fashion us in the womb?
Job,31,16,"If I have withheld aught that the poor desired, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;"
Job,31,17,"Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof—"
Job,31,18,"Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And I have been her guide from my mother’s womb."
Job,31,19,"If I have seen any wanderer in want of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering;"
Job,31,20,"If his loins have not blessed me, And if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;"
Job,31,21,"If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, Because I saw my help in the gate;"
Job,31,22,"Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, And mine arm be broken from the bone."
Job,31,23,"For calamity from God was a terror to me, And by reason of His majesty I could do nothing."
Job,31,24,"If I have made gold my hope, And have said to the fine gold: ‘Thou art my confidence’;"
Job,31,25,"If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, And because my hand had gotten much;"
Job,31,26,"If I beheld the sun when it shined, Or the moon walking in brightness;"
Job,31,27,"And my heart hath been secretly enticed, And my mouth hath kissed my hand;"
Job,31,28,This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges; For I should have lied to God that is above.
Job,31,29,"If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, Or exulted when evil found him—"
Job,31,30,"Yea, I suffered not my mouth to sin By asking his life with a curse."
Job,31,31,If the men of my tent said not: ‘Who can find one that hath not been satisfied with his meat?’
Job,31,32,The stranger did not lodge in the street; My doors I opened to the roadside.
Job,31,33,"If after the manner of men I covered my transgressions, By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom—"
Job,31,34,"Because I feared the great multitude, And the most contemptible among families terrified me, So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door."
Job,31,35,"Oh that I had one to hear me!—Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me—And that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written!"
Job,31,36,Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown.
Job,31,37,I would declare unto him the number of my steps; As a prince would I go near unto him.
Job,31,38,"If my land cry out against me, And the furrows thereof weep together;"
Job,31,39,"If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, Or have caused the tillers thereof to be disappointed—"
Job,31,40,"Let thistles grow instead of wheat, And noisome weeds instead of barley. The words of Job are ended."
Job,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job was his"
Job,32,3,Also against his three friends was his
Job,32,4,Now Elihu had waited
Job,32,5,"And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled."
Job,32,6,"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: I am young, and ye are very old; Wherefore I held back, and durst not declare you mine opinion."
Job,32,7,"I said: ‘Days should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.’"
Job,32,8,"But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty, that giveth them understanding."
Job,32,9,"It is not the great that are wise, Nor the aged that discern judgment."
Job,32,10,Therefore I say: ‘Hearken to me; I also will declare mine opinion.’
Job,32,11,"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasons, Whilst ye searched out what to say."
Job,32,12,"Yea, I attended unto you, And, behold, there was none that convinced Job, Or that answered his words, among you."
Job,32,13,"Beware lest ye say: ‘We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man!’"
Job,32,14,For he hath not directed his words against me; Neither will I answer him with your speeches.
Job,32,15,"They are amazed, they answer no more; Words are departed from them."
Job,32,16,"And shall I wait, because they speak not, Because they stand still, and answer no more?"
Job,32,17,"I also will answer my part, I also will declare mine opinion."
Job,32,18,For I am full of words; The spirit within me constraineth me.
Job,32,19,"Behold, mine inwards are as wine which hath no vent; Like new wine-skins which are ready to burst."
Job,32,20,"I will speak, that I may find relief; I will open my lips and answer."
Job,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, respect any man’s person; Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man."
Job,32,22,For I know not to give flattering titles; Else would my Maker soon take me away
Job,33,1,"Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, And hearken to all my words."
Job,33,2,"Behold now, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath spoken in my mouth."
Job,33,3,My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.
Job,33,4,"The spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty given me life."
Job,33,5,"If thou canst, answer thou me, Set thy words in order before me, stand forth."
Job,33,6,"Behold, I am toward God even as thou art; I also am formed out of the clay."
Job,33,7,"Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee."
Job,33,8,"Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of thy words;"
Job,33,9,"I am clean, without transgression, I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me;"
Job,33,10,"Behold, He findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for His enemy;"
Job,33,11,"He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths.’"
Job,33,12,"Behold, I answer thee: In this thou art not right, That God is too great for man;"
Job,33,13,Why hast thou striven against Him? Seeing that He will not answer any of his words.
Job,33,14,"For God speaketh in one way, Yea in two, though man perceiveth it not."
Job,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed;"
Job,33,16,"Then He openeth the ears of men, And by their chastisement sealeth the decree,"
Job,33,17,"That men may put away their purpose, And that He may hide pride from man;"
Job,33,18,"That He may keep back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword."
Job,33,19,"He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And all his bones grow stiff;"
Job,33,20,"So that his life maketh him to abhor bread, And his soul dainty food."
Job,33,21,"His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; And his bones corrode to unsightliness."
Job,33,22,"Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, And his life to the destroyers."
Job,33,23,"If there be for him an angel, An intercessor, one among a thousand, To vouch for a man’s uprightness;"
Job,33,24,"Then He is gracious unto him, and saith: ‘Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.’"
Job,33,25,His flesh is tenderer than a child’s; He returneth to the days of his youth;
Job,33,26,"He prayeth unto God, and He is favourable unto him; So that he seeth His face with joy; And He restoreth unto man his righteousness."
Job,33,27,"He cometh before men, and saith: ‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not.’"
Job,33,28,"So He redeemeth his soul from going into the pit, And his life beholdeth the light."
Job,33,29,"Lo, all these things doth God work, Twice, yea thrice, with a man,"
Job,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living."
Job,33,31,"Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me; Hold thy peace, and I will speak."
Job,33,32,"If thou hast any thing to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify thee."
Job,33,33,"If not, hearken thou unto me; Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom."
Job,34,1,Moreover Elihu answered and said:
Job,34,2,"Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge."
Job,34,3,"For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food."
Job,34,4,Let us choose for us that which is right; Let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job,34,5,"For Job hath said: ‘I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right;"
Job,34,6,"Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’"
Job,34,7,"What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scorning like water?"
Job,34,8,"Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men."
Job,34,9,For he hath said: ‘It profiteth a man nothing That he should be in accord with God.’
Job,34,10,"Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that He should do wickedness; And from the Almighty, that He should commit iniquity."
Job,34,11,"For the work of a man will He requite unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways."
Job,34,12,"Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice."
Job,34,13,Who gave Him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world?
Job,34,14,"If He set His heart upon man, If He gather unto Himself his spirit and his breath;"
Job,34,15,"All flesh shall perish together, And man shall return unto dust."
Job,34,16,"If now thou hast understanding, hear this; Hearken to the voice of my words."
Job,34,17,Shall even one that hateth right govern? And wilt thou condemn Him that is just and mighty—
Job,34,18,Is it fit to say to a king: ‘Thou art base’? Or to nobles: ‘Ye are wicked’?—
Job,34,19,"That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? For they all are the work of His hands."
Job,34,20,"In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand."
Job,34,21,"For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He seeth all his goings."
Job,34,22,"There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
Job,34,23,"For He doth not appoint a time unto any man, When he should go before God in judgment."
Job,34,24,"He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquisition, And setteth others in their stead."
Job,34,25,"Therefore He taketh knowledge of their works; And He overturneth them in the night, so that they are crushed."
Job,34,26,He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others;
Job,34,27,"Because they turned aside from following Him, And would not have regard to any of His ways;"
Job,34,28,"So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto Him, And He heareth the cry of the afflicted."
Job,34,29,"When He giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when He hideth His face, who then can behold Him? Whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man, alike;"
Job,34,30,"That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people."
Job,34,31,"For hath any said unto God: ‘I have borne chastisement, though I offend not;"
Job,34,32,"That which I see not teach Thou me; If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?"
Job,34,33,"Shall His recompense be as thou wilt? For thou loathest it, So that thou must choose, and not I; Therefore speak what thou knowest."
Job,34,34,"Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me:"
Job,34,35,"Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without discernment.’"
Job,34,36,"Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men."
Job,34,37,"For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God."
Job,35,1,Moreover Elihu answered and said:
Job,35,2,"Thinkest thou this to be thy right, Or sayest thou: ‘I am righteousness before God’,"
Job,35,3,"That thou inquirest: ‘What advantage will it be unto Thee?’ And: ‘What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?’"
Job,35,4,"I will give thee answer, And thy companions with thee."
Job,35,5,"Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou."
Job,35,6,"If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against Him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him?"
Job,35,7,"If thou be righteous, what givest thou Him? Or what receiveth He of thy hand?"
Job,35,8,Thy wickedness concerneth a man as thou art; And thy righteousness a son of man.
Job,35,9,By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job,35,10,"But none saith: ‘Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night;"
Job,35,11,"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?’"
Job,35,12,"There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men."
Job,35,13,"Surely God will not hear vanity, Neither will the Almighty regard it."
Job,35,14,"Yea, when thou sayest thou canst not see Him—The cause is before Him; therefore wait thou for Him."
Job,35,15,"And now, is it for nought that He punished in His anger? And hath He not full knowledge of arrogance?"
Job,35,16,But Job doth open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.
Job,36,1,"Elihu also proceeded, and said:"
Job,36,2,"Suffer me a little, and I will tell thee; For there are yet words on God’s behalf."
Job,36,3,"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
Job,36,4,For truly my words are not false; One that is upright in mind is with thee.
Job,36,5,"Behold, God is mighty, yet He despiseth not any; He is mighty in strength of understanding."
Job,36,6,He preserveth not the life of the wicked; But giveth to the poor their right.
Job,36,7,"He withdraweth not His eyes from the righteous; But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"And if they be bound in fetters, And be holden in cords of affliction;"
Job,36,9,"Then He declareth unto them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly."
Job,36,10,"He openeth also their ear to discipline, And commandeth that they return from iniquity."
Job,36,11,"If they hearken and serve Him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures."
Job,36,12,"But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge."
Job,36,13,But they that are godless in heart lay up anger; They cry not for help when He bindeth them.
Job,36,14,"Their soul perisheth in youth, And their life as that of the depraved."
Job,36,15,"He delivereth the afflicted by His affliction, And openeth their ear by tribulation."
Job,36,16,"Yea, He hath allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table is full of fatness;"
Job,36,17,And thou art full of the judgment of the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold on them.
Job,36,18,"For beware of wrath, lest thou be led away by thy sufficiency; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside."
Job,36,19,"Will thy riches avail, that are without stint, Or all the forces of thy strength?"
Job,36,20,"Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place."
Job,36,21,"Take heed, regard not iniquity; For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction."
Job,36,22,"Behold, God doeth loftily in His power; Who is a teacher like Him?"
Job,36,23,Who hath enjoined Him His way? Or who hath said: ‘Thou hast wrought unrighteousness’?
Job,36,24,"Remember that thou magnify His work, Whereof men have sung."
Job,36,25,All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off.
Job,36,26,"Behold, God is great, beyond our knowledge; The number of His years is unsearchable."
Job,36,27,"For He draweth away the drops of water, Which distil rain from His vapour;"
Job,36,28,Which the skies pour down And drop upon the multitudes of men.
Job,36,29,"Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The crashings of His pavilion?"
Job,36,30,"Behold, He spreadeth His light upon it; And He covereth the depths of the sea."
Job,36,31,For by these He judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance.
Job,36,32,"He covereth His hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark."
Job,36,33,"The noise thereof telleth concerning it, The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up."

Job,37,2,"Hear attentively the noise of His voice, And the sound that goeth out of His mouth."
Job,37,3,"He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, And His lightning unto the ends of the earth."
Job,37,4,After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of His majesty; And He stayeth them not when His voice is heard.
Job,37,5,"God thundereth marvellously with His voice; Great things doeth He, which we cannot comprehend."
Job,37,6,"For He saith to the snow: ‘Fall thou on the earth’; Likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of His mighty rain."
Job,37,7,"He sealeth up the hand of every man, That all men whom He hath made may know it."
Job,37,8,"Then the beasts go into coverts, And remain in their dens."
Job,37,9,Out of the Chamber cometh the storm; And cold out of the north.
Job,37,10,"By the breath of God ice is given, And the breadth of the waters is straitened."
Job,37,11,"Yea, He ladeth the thick cloud with moister, He spreadeth abroad the cloud of His lightning;"
Job,37,12,"And they are turned round about by His guidance, That they may do whatsoever He commandeth them Upon the face of the habitable world:"
Job,37,13,"Whether it be for correction, or for His earth, Or for mercy, that He cause it to come."
Job,37,14,"Hearken unto this, O Job; Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God."
Job,37,15,"Dost thou know how God enjoineth them, And causeth the lightning of His cloud to shine?"
Job,37,16,"Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, The wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?"
Job,37,17,"Thou whose garments are warm, When the earth is still by reason of the south wind;"
Job,37,18,"Canst thou with Him spread out the sky, Which is strong as a molten mirror?"
Job,37,19,Teach us what we shall say unto Him; For we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
Job,37,20,Shall it be told Him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
Job,37,21,"And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind passeth, and cleanseth them."
Job,37,22,"Out of the north cometh golden splendour, About God is terrible majesty."
Job,37,23,"The Almighty, whom we cannot find out, is excellent in power, Yet to judgment and plenteous justice He doeth no violence."
Job,37,24,Men do therefore fear Him; He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.
Job,38,1,"Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:"
Job,38,2,Who is this that darkeneth counsel By words without knowledge?
Job,38,3,"Gird up now thy loins like a man; For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto Me."
Job,38,4,"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast the understanding."
Job,38,5,"Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who stretched the line upon it?"
Job,38,6,"Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,"
Job,38,7,"When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
Job,38,8,"Or who shut up the sea with doors, When it broke forth, and issued out of the womb;"
Job,38,9,"When I made the cloud the garment thereof, And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,"
Job,38,10,"And prescribed for it My decree, And set bars and doors,"
Job,38,11,"And said: ‘Thus far shalt thou come, but no further; And here shall thy proud waves be stayed’?"
Job,38,12,"Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began, And caused the dayspring to know its place;"
Job,38,13,"That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?"
Job,38,14,It is changed as clay under the seal; And they stand as a garment.
Job,38,15,"But from the wicked their light is withholden, And the high arm is broken."
Job,38,16,Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?
Job,38,17,Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?
Job,38,18,"Hast thou surveyed unto the breadths of the earth? Declare, if thou knowest it all."
Job,38,19,"Where is the way to the dwelling of light, And as for darkness, where is the place thereof;"
Job,38,20,"That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?"
Job,38,21,"Thou knowest it, for thou wast then born, And the number of thy days is great!"
Job,38,22,"Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, Or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,"
Job,38,23,"Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, Against the day of battle and war?"
Job,38,24,"By what way is the light parted, Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?"
Job,38,25,"Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, Or a way for the lightning of the thunder;"
Job,38,26,"To cause it to rain on a land where no man is, On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;"
Job,38,27,"To satisfy the desolate and waste ground, And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?"
Job,38,28,Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
Job,38,29,"Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoar-frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?"
Job,38,30,"The waters are congealed like stone, And the face of the deep is frozen."
Job,38,31,"Canst thou bind the chains of the Pleiades, Or loose the bands of Orion?"
Job,38,32,Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? Or canst thou guide the Bear with her sons?
Job,38,33,Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?
Job,38,34,"Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, That abundance of waters may cover thee?"
Job,38,35,"Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, And say unto thee: ‘Here we are’?"
Job,38,36,Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who hath given understanding to the mind?
Job,38,37,"Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,"
Job,38,38,"When the dust runneth into a mass, And the clods cleave fast together?"
Job,38,39,"Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lioness? Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,"
Job,38,40,"When they couch in their dens, And abide in the covert to lie in wait?"
Job,38,41,"Who provideth for the raven his prey, When his young ones cry unto God, and wander for lack of food?"
Job,39,1,Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
Job,39,2,Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
Job,39,3,"They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their fruit."
Job,39,4,"Their young ones wax strong, they grow up in the open field; They go forth, and return not again."
Job,39,5,Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
Job,39,6,"Whose house I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place."
Job,39,7,"He scorneth the tumult of the city, Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver."
Job,39,8,"The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searcheth after every green thing."
Job,39,9,Will the wild-ox be willing to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib?
Job,39,10,Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
Job,39,11,"Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?"
Job,39,12,"Wilt thou rely on him, that he will bring home thy seed, And gather the corn of thy threshing-floor?"
Job,39,13,The wing of the ostrich beateth joyously; But are her pinions and feathers the kindly stork’s?
Job,39,14,"For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, And warmeth them in dust,"
Job,39,15,"And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them."
Job,39,16,"She is hardened against her young ones, as if they were not hers; Though her labour be in vain, she is without fear;"
Job,39,17,"Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, Neither hath He imparted to her understanding."
Job,39,18,"When the time cometh, she raiseth her wings on high, And scorneth the horse and his rider."
Job,39,19,Hast thou given the horse his strength? Hast thou clothed his neck with fierceness?
Job,39,20,Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible.
Job,39,21,"He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength; He goeth out to meet the clash of arms."
Job,39,22,"He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; Neither turneth he back from the sword."
Job,39,23,"The quiver rattleth upon him, The glittering spear and the javelin."
Job,39,24,He swalloweth the ground with storm and rage; Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the horn.
Job,39,25,"As oft as he heareth the horn he saith: ‘Ha, ha!’ And he smelleth the battle afar off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting."
Job,39,26,"Doth the hawk soar by thy wisdom, And stretch her wings toward the south?"
Job,39,27,"Doth the vulture mount up at thy command, And make her nest on high?"
Job,39,28,"She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, Upon the crag of the rock, and the stronghold."
Job,39,29,From thence she spieth out the prey; Her eyes behold it afar off.
Job,39,30,"Her young ones also suck up blood; And where the slain are, there is she."
Job,40,1,"Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said:"
Job,40,2,"Shall he that reproveth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it."
Job,40,3,"Then Job answered the LORD, and said:"
Job,40,4,"Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer Thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth."
Job,40,5,"Once have I spoken, but I will not answer again; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further. The LORD Challenges Job Again"
Job,40,6,"Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:"
Job,40,7,"Gird up thy loins now like a man; I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto Me."
Job,40,8,"Wilt thou even make void My judgment? Wilt thou condemn Me, that thou mayest be justified?"
Job,40,9,Or hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like Him?
Job,40,10,"Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency, And array thyself with glory and beauty."
Job,40,11,"Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath; And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him."
Job,40,12,"Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; And tread down the wicked in their place."
Job,40,13,Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden place.
Job,40,14,Then will I also confess unto thee That thine own right hand can save thee.
Job,40,15,"Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; He eateth grass as an ox."
Job,40,16,"Lo now, his strength is in his loins, And his force is in the stays of his body."
Job,40,17,He straineth his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
Job,40,18,His bones are as pipes of brass; His gristles are like bars of iron.
Job,40,19,He is the beginning of the ways of God; He only that made him can make His sword to approach unto him.
Job,40,20,"Surely the mountains bring him forth food, And all the beasts of the field play there."
Job,40,21,"He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and fens."
Job,40,22,The lotus-trees cover him with their shadow; The willows of the brook compass him about.
Job,40,23,"Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though the Jordan rush forth to his mouth."
Job,40,24,"Shall any take him by his eyes, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?"
Job,41,1,Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish-hook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?
Job,41,2,Canst thou put a ring into his nose? Or bore his jaw through with a hook?
Job,41,3,Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee?
Job,41,4,"Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?"
Job,41,5,Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
Job,41,6,Will the bands of fishermen make a banquet of him? Will they part him among the merchants?
Job,41,7,Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? Or his head with fish-spears?
Job,41,8,"Lay thy hand upon him; Think upon the battle, thou wilt do so no more."
Job,41,9,"Behold, the hope of him is in vain; Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?"
Job,41,10,None is so fierce that dare stir him up; Who then is able to stand before Me?
Job,41,11,"Who hath given Me anything beforehand, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is Mine."
Job,41,12,"Would I keep silence concerning his boastings, Or his proud talk, or his fair array of words?"
Job,41,13,Who can uncover the face of his garment? Who shall come within his double bridle?
Job,41,14,Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.
Job,41,15,"His scales are his pride, Shut up together as with a close seal."
Job,41,16,"One is so near to another, That no air can come between them."
Job,41,17,"They are joined one to another; They stick together, that they cannot be sundered."
Job,41,18,"His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning."

Job,41,21,"His breath kindleth coals, And a flame goeth out of his mouth."
Job,41,22,"In his neck abideth strength, And dismay danceth before him."
Job,41,23,The flakes of his flesh are joined together; They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.
Job,41,24,"His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone."
Job,41,25,"When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid; By reason of despair they are beside themselves."
Job,41,26,"If one lay at him with the sword, it will not hold; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft."
Job,41,27,"He esteemeth iron as straw, And brass as rotten wood."
Job,41,28,The arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
Job,41,29,Clubs are accounted as stubble; He laugheth at the rattling of the javelin.
Job,41,30,Sharpest potsherds are under him; He spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire.
Job,41,31,He maketh the deep to boil like a pot; He maketh the sea like a seething mixture.
Job,41,32,He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary.
Job,41,33,Upon earth there is not his like Who is made to be fearless.
Job,41,34,He looketh at all high things; He is king over all the proud beasts.
Job,42,1,"Then Job answered the LORD, and said:"
Job,42,2,"I know that Thou canst do every thing, And that no purpose can be withholden from Thee."
Job,42,3,"Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not, Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not."
Job,42,4,"Hear, I beseech Thee, and I will speak; I will demand of Thee, and declare Thou unto me."
Job,42,5,I had heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear; But now mine eye seeth Thee;
Job,42,6,"Wherefore I abhor my words, and repent, Seeing I am dust and ashes. The LORD Rebukes Job’s Friends"

Job,42,12,"So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels,"
Job,42,13,He had also seven sons and three
Job,42,14,"And he called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and"

Jeremiah,22,11,"For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went forth out of this place: He shall not return thither any more; 12but in the place whither they have led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more. A Warning about Jehoiakim"
Jeremiah,22,13,"Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, And his chambers by injustice; That useth his neighbour’s service without wages, And giveth him not his hire;"
Jeremiah,22,14,"That saith: ‘I will build me a wide house And spacious chambers’, And cutteth him out windows, And it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion."
Jeremiah,22,15,"Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him."
Jeremiah,22,16,He judged the cause of the poor and needy; Then it was well. Is not this to know Me? saith the LORD.
Jeremiah,22,17,"But thine eyes and thy heart Are not but for thy covetousness, And for shedding innocent blood, And for oppression, and for violence, to do it."
Jeremiah,22,18,"Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: They shall not lament for him: ‘Ah my brother!’ or: ‘Ah sister!’ They shall not lament for him: ‘Ah lord!’ or: ‘Ah his glory!’"
Jeremiah,22,19,"He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, Drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,22,20,"Go up to Lebanon, and cry, And lift up thy voice in Bashan; And cry from Abarim, For all thy lovers are destroyed."
Jeremiah,22,21,"I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity, But thou saidst: ‘I will not hear.’ This hath been thy manner from thy youth, That thou hearkenedst not to My voice."
Jeremiah,22,22,"The wind shall feed upon all thy shepherds, And thy lovers shall go into captivity; Surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded For all thy wickedness."
Jeremiah,22,23,"O inhabitant of Lebanon, That art nestled in the cedars, How gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, The pain as of a woman in travail! A Warning to Coniah"
Jeremiah,22,24,"As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon My right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence; 25and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king"
Jeremiah,22,26,"And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bore"
Jeremiah,22,27,"But to the land whereunto they long to return, thither shall they not return."
Jeremiah,22,28,"Is this man Coniah a despised, broken image? Is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? Wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, And are cast into the land which they know not?"
Jeremiah,22,29,"O land, land, land, Hear the word of the LORD."
Jeremiah,22,30,"Thus saith the LORD: Write ye this man childless, A man that shall not prosper in his days; For no man of his seed shall prosper, Sitting upon the throne of David, And ruling any more in Judah."
Jeremiah,23,1,Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter The sheep of My pasture! saith the LORD.
Jeremiah,23,2,"Therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, against the shepherds that feed My people: Ye have scattered My flock, and driven them away, and have not taken care of them; behold, I will visit upon you the evil"
Jeremiah,23,3,"And I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them back to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and"

Jeremiah,23,6,"In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called, The LORD is our righteousness."
Jeremiah,23,7,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say: ‘As the LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt’; 8but: ‘As the LORD liveth, that brought up and that led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries whither I had driven them’; and they shall dwell in their own land. Lying Prophets"
Jeremiah,23,9,"Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, All my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, And like a man whom wine hath overcome; Because of the LORD, And because of His holy words."
Jeremiah,23,10,"For the land is full of adulterers; For because of swearing the land mourneth, The pastures of the wilderness are dried up; And their course is evil, And their force is not right."
Jeremiah,23,11,"For both prophet and priest are ungodly; Yea, in My house have I found their wickedness, Saith the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,12,"Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness, They shall be thrust, and fall therein; For I will bring evil upon them, Even the year of their visitation, Saith the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,13,"And I have seen unseemliness in the prophets of Samaria: They prophesied by Baal, And caused My people Israel to err."
Jeremiah,23,14,"But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: They commit adultery, and walk in lies, And they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, That none doth return from his wickedness; They are all of them become unto Me as Sodom, And the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah."
Jeremiah,23,15,"Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, And make them drink the water of gall; For from the prophets of Jerusalem Is ungodliness gone forth into all the land."
Jeremiah,23,16,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you, They lead you unto vanity; They speak a vision of their own heart, And not out of the mouth of the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,17,They say continually unto them that despise Me: ‘The LORD hath said: Ye shall have peace’; And unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say: ‘No evil shall come upon you’;
Jeremiah,23,18,"For who hath stood in the council of the LORD, That he should perceive and hear His word? Who hath attended to His word, and heard it?"
Jeremiah,23,19,"Behold, a storm of the LORD is gone forth in fury, Yea, a whirling storm; It shall whirl upon the head of the wicked."
Jeremiah,23,20,"The anger of the LORD shall not return, Until He have executed, and till He have performed the purposes of His heart; In the end of days ye shall consider it perfectly."
Jeremiah,23,21,"I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran; I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied."
Jeremiah,23,22,"But if they have stood in My council, Then let them cause My people to hear My words, And turn them from their evil way, And from the evil of their doings."
Jeremiah,23,23,"Am I a God near at hand, saith the LORD, And not a God afar off?"
Jeremiah,23,24,Can any hide himself in secret places That I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? Saith the LORD.
Jeremiah,23,25,"I have heard what the prophets have said, That prophesy lies in My name, saying: ‘I have dreamed,"
Jeremiah,23,26,"How long shall this be? Is it in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, And"
Jeremiah,23,27,"That think to cause My people to forget My name By their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, As their fathers forgot My name for Baal."
Jeremiah,23,28,"The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; And he that hath My word; let him speak My"

Jeremiah,23,31,"Behold, I"
Jeremiah,23,32,"Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause My people to err by their lies, and by their wantonness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; neither can they profit this people at all, saith the LORD. False Prophecies"
Jeremiah,23,33,"And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying: ‘What is the burden of the"
Jeremiah,23,34,"And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say: ‘The burden of the LORD’, I will even punish"
Jeremiah,23,35,"Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother:"
Jeremiah,23,36,And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more; for every man’s own word shall be his burden; and would ye pervert the

Jeremiah,24,1,"The LORD showed me, and behold two baskets of figs set before the temple of the LORD; after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to"

Jeremiah,24,3,"Then said the LORD unto me: ‘What seest thou, Jeremiah?’ And I said: ‘Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.’"
Jeremiah,24,4,"And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:"
Jeremiah,24,5,"Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of"
Jeremiah,24,6,"And I will set Mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them back to this land; and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up."
Jeremiah,24,7,"And I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the LORD; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God; for they shall return unto Me with their whole heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus saith the LORD: So will I make Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this"
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will even make them a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive"
Jeremiah,24,10,"And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.’"
Jeremiah,25,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; 2which Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,"
Jeremiah,25,3,"From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you,"
Jeremiah,25,4,"And the LORD hath sent unto you all His servants the prophets, sending them betimes and often—but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear— 5saying: ‘Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers, for ever and ever; 6and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke Me not with the work of your"
Jeremiah,25,7,"Yet ye have not hearkened unto Me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke Me with the work of your hands to your own hurt."
Jeremiah,25,8,"Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts: Because ye have not heard My words, 9behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and I will send unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment,"
Jeremiah,25,10,"Moreover I will cause to cease from among them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound"
Jeremiah,25,11,"And this whole land shall be a desolation, and a waste; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years."

Jeremiah,25,13,"And I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations."
Jeremiah,25,14,"For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them also; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their own hands. The Cup of God’s Wrath"
Jeremiah,25,15,"For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto me: Take this cup of the wine of fury at My hand,"
Jeremiah,25,16,"And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be like madmen, because of the sword that I will send among them.—"
Jeremiah,25,17,"Then took I the cup of the LORD’S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD"

Jeremiah,25,27,"And thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you."
Jeremiah,25,28,"And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them:"
Jeremiah,25,29,"For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city whereupon My name is called, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts."
Jeremiah,25,30,"Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them: The LORD doth roar from on high, And utter His voice from His holy habitation; He doth mightily roar because of His fold; He giveth a shout, as they that tread the grapes, Against all the inhabitants of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,31,"A noise is come even to the end of the earth; For the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, He doth plead with all flesh; As for the wicked, He hath given them to the sword, Saith the LORD."

Jeremiah,25,33,"And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground. The Cry of the Shepherds"
Jeremiah,25,34,"Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; And wallow yourselves in the dust, ye leaders of the flock; For the days of your slaughter are fully come, And I will break you in pieces, And ye shall fall like a precious vessel."
Jeremiah,25,35,"And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, Nor the leaders of the flock to escape."
Jeremiah,25,36,"Hark! the cry of the shepherds, And the wailing of the leaders of the flock! For the LORD despoileth their pasture."
Jeremiah,25,37,And the peaceable folds are brought to silence Because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
Jeremiah,25,38,"He hath forsaken His covert, as the lion; For their land is become a waste Because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword, And because of His fierce anger."

Jeremiah,26,19,"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and entreat the favour of the LORD, and the LORD repented Him of the evil which He had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our own souls.’ The Prophet Uriah"
Jeremiah,26,20,"And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah; 21and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; 22and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt; 23and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the children of the people."
Jeremiah,26,24,"Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death."

Jeremiah,27,9,"But as for you, hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, that speak unto you, saying: Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; 10for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far"

Jeremiah,28,3,"Within two full years will I bring back into this place all the vessels of the LORD’S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon; 4and I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, saith the LORD; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’"
Jeremiah,28,5,"Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD, 6even the prophet Jeremiah said: ‘Amen! the LORD do so! the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the LORD’S house, and all them that are carried away captive, from Babylon unto this place!"
Jeremiah,28,7,"Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people:"
Jeremiah,28,8,"The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries,"
Jeremiah,28,9,"The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.’"
Jeremiah,28,10,"Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it."
Jeremiah,28,11,"And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two full years.’ And the prophet Jeremiah went his way."

The Message to Shemaiah"
Jeremiah,29,24,"And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying:"

Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions; 18that they might ask mercy of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,19,Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel,2,20,Daniel spoke and said: Blessed be the name of God From everlasting even unto everlasting; For wisdom and might are His;
Daniel,2,21,"And He changeth the times and the seasons; He removeth kings, and setteth up kings; He giveth wisdom unto the wise, And knowledge to them that know understanding;"
Daniel,2,22,"He revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, And the light dwelleth with Him."
Daniel,2,23,"I thank Thee, and praise Thee, O Thou God of my fathers, Who hast given me wisdom and might, And hast now made known unto me what we desired of Thee; For Thou hast made known unto us the king’s matter. Daniel Interprets the Dream"
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: ‘Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will declare unto the king the interpretation.’"
Daniel,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him: ‘I have found a man"
Daniel,2,26,"The king spoke and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar: ‘Art thou able to make known unto me"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered before the king, and said: ‘The secret which the king hath asked can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor astrologers, declare unto the king; 28but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and He hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these: 29as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and He that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee"
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart."
Daniel,2,31,"Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose"
Daniel,2,32,"As for that image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, 33its"
Daniel,2,34,"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces."
Daniel,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them; and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
Daniel,2,37,"Thou, O king, king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory; 38and wheresoever the children of men, the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the heaven dwell, hath He given them into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all; thou art the head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth."
Daniel,2,40,And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and beateth
Daniel,2,41,"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the firmness of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay."
Daniel,2,42,"And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so part of the kingdom shall be strong,"
Daniel,2,43,"And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves by the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay."
Daniel,2,44,"And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed; nor shall the kingdom be left to another people; it shall break in pieces and consume all"
Daniel,2,45,"Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter; and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.’ Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel"
Daniel,2,46,"Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they"

Daniel,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

Daniel,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.’"
Daniel,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego."
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them: ‘Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my gods, nor worship the golden image"
Daniel,3,15,"Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, well; but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is the god that shall deliver you out of my hands?’"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king: ‘O Nebuchadnezzar, we have"
Daniel,3,17,"If our God whom we serve is able to deliver us, He will deliver"
Daniel,3,18,"But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.’ The Fiery Furnace"
Daniel,3,19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar filled with fury, and the form of his visage was changed, against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times"
Daniel,3,20,And he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army
Daniel,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, and their robes, and their other garments, and were"
Daniel,3,22,"Therefore because the king’s commandment was peremptory, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach,"
Daniel,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was alarmed, and rose up in haste; he spoke and said unto his ministers: ‘Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?’ They answered and said unto"
Daniel,3,25,"He answered and said: ‘Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the"
Daniel,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace; he spoke and said: ‘Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of God Most High, come forth, and come hither.’ Then Shadrach,"
Daniel,3,27,"And the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the king’s ministers, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their cloaks changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them."
Daniel,3,28,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said: ‘Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent His angel, and delivered His servants that trusted in Him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall"

Daniel,4,8,"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the"
Daniel,4,9,"O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret causeth thee trouble, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof."
Daniel,4,10,"Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, And behold a tree in the midst of the earth, And the height thereof was great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree grew, and was strong, And the height thereof reached unto heaven, And the sight thereof to the end of all the earth."
Daniel,4,12,"The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, And in it was food for all; The beasts of the field had shadow under it, And the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the branches thereof, And all flesh was fed of it."
Daniel,4,13,"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven."
Daniel,4,14,"He cried aloud, and said thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, Shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; Let the beasts get away from under it, And the fowls from its branches."
Daniel,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, Even in a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; And let it be wet with the dew of heaven, And let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth;"
Daniel,4,16,"Let his heart be changed from man’s, And let a beast’s heart be given unto him; And let seven times pass over him."
Daniel,4,17,"The matter is by the decree of the watchers, And the sentence by the word of the holy ones; To the intent that the living may know That the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, And giveth it to whomsoever He will, And setteth up over it the lowest of men."
Daniel,4,18,"This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.’ Daniel Interprets the Second Dream"
Daniel,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while, and his thoughts affrighted him.

Daniel,4,28,All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.

Daniel,4,33,"The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws. Nebuchadnezzar Restored"
Daniel,4,34,"And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured Him that liveth for ever; For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, And His kingdom from generation to generation;"
Daniel,4,35,"And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; And He doeth according to His will in the host of heaven, And among the inhabitants of the earth; And none can stay His hand, Or say unto Him: What doest Thou?"
Daniel,4,36,"At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and my splendour returned unto me; and my ministers and my lords sought unto me; and I"
Daniel,4,37,"Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven; for all His works are truth, and His ways justice; and those that walk in pride He is able to abase.’"
Daniel,5,1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand."

Daniel,5,9,"Then was king Belshazzar greatly affrighted, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed."
Daniel,5,10,"Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house; the queen spoke and said: ‘O king, live for ever! let not thy thoughts affright thee, nor let thy countenance be changed; 11there is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers; 12forasmuch as a surpassing spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and declaring of riddles, and loosing of knots, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will declare the interpretation.’ Daniel Interprets the Handwriting"
Daniel,5,13,"Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spoke and said unto Daniel: ‘Art thou Daniel,"

Daniel,5,17,"Then Daniel answered and said before the king: ‘Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation."
Daniel,5,18,"O thou king, God Most High gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty; 19and because of the greatness that He gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and"

Daniel,5,22,"And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this; 23but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy consorts and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified; 24then was the palm of the hand sent from before Him, and this writing was inscribed."
Daniel,5,25,"And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN."
Daniel,5,26,This is the interpretation

Daniel,5,28,"PERES, thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.’"
Daniel,5,29,"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should rule as one of three in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain.
Daniel,5,31,"And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old."
Daniel,6,1,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom; 2and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps"
Daniel,6,3,"Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the presidents and the satraps, because a surpassing spirit was in him;"
Daniel,6,4,Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault;
Daniel,6,5,"Then said these men: ‘We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him in the matter of the law of his God.’"
Daniel,6,6,"Then these presidents and satraps came tumultuously to the king, and said thus unto him: ‘King"

Daniel,6,12,"Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s interdict: ‘Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?’ The king answered and said: ‘The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and"

Daniel,6,17,"And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet,"
Daniel,6,18,"Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were diversions brought before him; and his sleep fled from him."
Daniel,6,19,"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions."
Daniel,6,20,"And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a pained voice; the king spoke and said to Daniel: ‘O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee"
Daniel,6,21,"Then said Daniel unto the king: ‘O king, live for ever!"
Daniel,6,22,"My God hath sent His angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before Him innocency was"
Daniel,6,23,"Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"And the king commanded, and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and they had not come to the bottom of the den, when the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces. Darius Honors God"
Daniel,6,25,"Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: ‘Peace be multiplied unto you."
Daniel,6,26,"I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; For He is the living God, And stedfast for ever, And His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, And His dominion shall be even unto the end;"
Daniel,6,27,"He delivereth and rescueth, And He worketh signs and wonders In heaven and in earth; Who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.’"
Daniel,6,28,"So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian."

Daniel,7,7,"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had"
Daniel,7,8,"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. Daniel’s Vision of the Ancient of Days"
Daniel,7,9,"I beheld Till thrones were placed, And one that was ancient of days did sit: His raiment was as white snow, And the hair of his head like pure wool; His throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire."
Daniel,7,10,"A fiery stream issued And came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, And ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; The judgment was set, And the books were opened."
Daniel,7,11,"I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke, I beheld even"
Daniel,7,12,"And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. Daniel’s Vision of the Son of Man"
Daniel,7,13,"I saw in the night visions, And, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven One like unto a son of man, And he came even to the Ancient of days, And he was brought near before Him."
Daniel,7,14,"And there was given him dominion, And glory, and a kingdom, That all the peoples, nations, and languages Should serve him; His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. Daniel’s Visions Interpreted"

Daniel,7,19,"Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; 20and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell; even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth"
Daniel,7,21,"I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; 22until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High; and the time came, and the saints possessed the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"Thus he said: ‘The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces."
Daniel,7,24,"And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise; and another shall arise after them;"
Daniel,7,25,"And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the"

Daniel,7,28,"Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much affrighted me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart."
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel,"

Daniel,8,3,"And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the stream a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the"
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself."
Daniel,8,5,"And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth,"
Daniel,8,6,"And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the stream, and ran at him in the fury"
Daniel,8,7,"And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver"
Daniel,8,8,"And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly; and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up the appearance of four horns toward the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and"
Daniel,8,10,"And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven;"
Daniel,8,11,"Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and from him the continual burnt-offering was taken"

Daniel,8,16,And I heard the voice of a man between
Daniel,8,17,"So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was terrified, and fell upon my face; but he said unto me: ‘Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.’"

Daniel,8,23,"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have completed their transgression, there shall stand up a king of fierce countenance, and understanding stratagems."
Daniel,8,24,"And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do; and he shall destroy them that are mighty and the people of the saints."
Daniel,8,25,"And through his cunning he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in time of security shall he destroy many; he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand."
Daniel,8,26,"And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true; but thou, shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come.’"

Hosea,1,2,"When the LORD spoke at first with Hosea, the LORD said unto Hosea: ‘Go, take unto thee a wife of harlotry and children of harlotry; for the land doth commit great harlotry, departing from the LORD.’"
Hosea,1,3,"So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son."
Hosea,1,4,"And the LORD said unto him: ‘Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will visit the blood of Jezreel"
Hosea,1,5,"And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.’"
Hosea,1,6,"And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And He said unto him: ‘Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have compassion upon the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them."
Hosea,1,7,"But I will have compassion upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.’"
Hosea,1,8,"Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son."

Hosea,2,4,And I will not have compassion upon her children; For they are children of harlotry.
Hosea,2,5,"For their mother hath played the harlot, She that conceived them hath done shamefully; For she said: ‘I will go after my lovers, That give me my bread and my water, My wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.’"
Hosea,2,6,"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, And I will make a wall against her, That she shall not find her paths."
Hosea,2,7,"And she shall run after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them, And she shall seek them, but shall not find them; Then shall she say: ‘I will go and return to my first husband; For then was it better with me than now.’"
Hosea,2,8,"For she did not know that it was I that gave her The corn, and the wine, and the oil, And multiplied unto her silver and gold, Which they used for Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"Therefore will I take back My corn in the time thereof, And My wine in the season thereof, And will snatch away My wool and My flax Given to cover her nakedness."
Hosea,2,10,"And now will I uncover her shame in the sight of her lovers, And none shall deliver her out of My hand."
Hosea,2,11,"I will also cause all her mirth to cease, Her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, And all her appointed seasons."
Hosea,2,12,"And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, Whereof she hath said: ‘These are my hire That my lovers have given me’; And I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field shall eat them."

Hosea,2,15,"And I will give her her vineyards from thence, And the valley of Achor for a door of hope; And she shall respond there, as in the days of her youth, And as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, That thou shalt call Me Ishi, And shalt call Me no more Baali."
Hosea,2,17,"For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, And they shall no more be mentioned by their name."
Hosea,2,18,"And in that day will I make a covenant for them With the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, And with the creeping things of the ground; And I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, And will make them to lie down safely."
Hosea,2,19,"And I will betroth thee unto Me for ever; Yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness, and in justice, And in lovingkindness, and in compassion."
Hosea,2,20,And I will betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness; And thou shalt know the LORD.
Hosea,2,21,"And it shall come to pass in that day, I will respond, saith the LORD, I will respond to the heavens, And they shall respond to the earth;"
Hosea,2,22,"And the earth shall respond to the corn, and the wine, and the oil; And they shall respond to Jezreel."
Hosea,2,23,And I will sow her unto Me in the land; And I will have compassion upon her that had not obtained compassion; And I will say to them that were not My people: ‘Thou art My people’; And they shall say: ‘Thou art my God.’
Hosea,3,1,"And the LORD said unto me: ‘Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend and an adulteress, even as the LORD loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins."
Hosea,3,2,"So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley; 3and I said unto her: ‘Thou shalt sit solitary for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou"
Hosea,3,4,"For the children of Israel shall sit solitary many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim; 5afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall come trembling unto the LORD and to His goodness in the end of days."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel! For the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, Because there is no truth, nor mercy, Nor knowledge of God in the land."
Hosea,4,2,"Swearing and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery! They break all bounds, and blood toucheth blood."
Hosea,4,3,"Therefore doth the land mourn, And every one that dwelleth therein doth languish, With the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven; Yea, the fishes of the sea also are taken away."
Hosea,4,4,"Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; For thy people are as they that strive with the priest."
Hosea,4,5,"Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day, And the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; And I will destroy thy mother."
Hosea,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to Me; Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children."
Hosea,4,7,"The more they were increased, the more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame."
Hosea,4,8,"They feed on the sin of My people, And set their heart on their iniquity."
Hosea,4,9,"And it is like people, like priest; And I will punish him for his ways, And will recompense him his doings."
Hosea,4,10,"And they shall eat, and not have enough, They shall commit harlotry, and shall not increase; Because they have left off to take heed to the LORD."
Hosea,4,11,"Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away the heart."
Hosea,4,12,"My people ask counsel at their stock, And their staff declareth unto them; For the spirit of harlotry hath caused them to err, And they have gone astray from under their God."
Hosea,4,13,"They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, And offer upon the hills, Under oaks and poplars and terebinths, Because the shadow thereof is good; Therefore your daughters commit harlotry, And your daughters-in-law commit adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry, Nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery; For they themselves consort with lewd women, And they sacrifice with harlots; And the people that is without understanding is distraught."
Hosea,4,15,"Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, Yet let not Judah become guilty; And come not ye unto Gilgal, Neither go ye up to Beth-aven, Nor swear: ‘As the LORD liveth.’"
Hosea,4,16,For Israel is stubborn like a stubborn heifer; Now shall the LORD feed them as a lamb in a large place?
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim is joined to idols; Let him alone.
Hosea,4,18,"When their carouse is over, They take to harlotry; Her rulers deeply love dishonour."
Hosea,4,19,The wind hath bound her up in her skirts; And they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
Hosea,5,1,"Hear this, O ye priests, And attend, ye house of Israel, And give ear, O house of the king, For unto you pertaineth the judgment; For ye have been a snare on Mizpah, And a net spread upon Tabor."
Hosea,5,2,And they that fall away are gone deep in making slaughter; And I am rejected of them all.
Hosea,5,3,"I, even I, know Ephraim, And Israel is not hid from Me; For now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed harlotry, Israel is defiled."
Hosea,5,4,"Their doings will not suffer them To return unto their God; For the spirit of harlotry is within them, And they know not the LORD."
Hosea,5,5,"But the pride of Israel shall testify to his face; And Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity, Judah also shall stumble with them."
Hosea,5,6,"With their flocks and with their herds they shall go To seek the LORD, but they shall not find Him; He hath withdrawn Himself from them."
Hosea,5,7,"They have dealt treacherously against the LORD, For they have begotten strange children; Now shall the new moon devour them with their portions."
Hosea,5,8,"Blow ye the horn in Gibeah, And the trumpet in Ramah; Sound an alarm at Beth-aven: ‘Behind thee, O Benjamin!’"
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke; Among the tribes of Israel do I make known that which shall surely be.
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark; I will pour out My wrath upon them like water.
Hosea,5,11,"Oppressed is Ephraim, crushed in his right; Because he willingly walked after filth."
Hosea,5,12,"Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, And to the house of Judah as rottenness."
Hosea,5,13,"And when Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria, And sent to King Contentious; But he is not able to heal you, Neither shall he cure you of your wound."
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, And as a young lion to the house of Judah; I, even I, will tear and go away, I will take away, and there shall be none to deliver."
Hosea,5,15,"I will go and return to My place, Till they acknowledge their guilt, and seek My face; In their trouble they will seek Me earnestly:"
Hosea,6,1,"Come, and let us return unto the LORD; For He hath torn, and He will heal us, He hath smitten, and He will bind us up."
Hosea,6,2,"After two days will He revive us, On the third day He will raise us up, that we may live in His presence."
Hosea,6,3,"And let us know, eagerly strive to know the LORD, His going forth is sure as the morning; And He shall come unto us as the rain, As the latter rain that watereth the earth.’"
Hosea,6,4,"O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? For your goodness is as a morning cloud, And as the dew that early passeth away."
Hosea,6,5,"Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of My mouth; And thy judgment goeth forth as the light."
Hosea,6,6,"For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God rather than burnt-offerings."
Hosea,6,7,But they like men have transgressed the covenant; There have they dealt treacherously against Me.
Hosea,6,8,"Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, It is covered with footprints of blood."
Hosea,6,9,"And as troops of robbers wait for a man, So doth the company of priests; They murder in the way toward Shechem; Yea, they commit enormity."
Hosea,6,10,"In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; There harlotry is found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled."
Hosea,6,11,"Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee! When I would turn the captivity of My people,"
Hosea,7,1,"When I would heal Israel, Then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, And the wickedness of Samaria, For they commit falsehood; And the thief entereth in, And the troop of robbers maketh a raid without."
Hosea,7,2,"And let them not say to their heart—I remember all their wickedness; Now their own doings have beset them about, They are before My face."
Hosea,7,3,"They make the king glad with their wickedness, And the princes with their lies."
Hosea,7,4,"They are all adulterers, As an oven heated by the baker, Who ceaseth to stir From the kneading of the dough until it be leavened."
Hosea,7,5,"On the day of our king The princes make him sick with the heat of wine, He stretcheth out his hand with scorners."
Hosea,7,6,"For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait; Their baker sleepeth all the night, In the morning it burneth as a flaming fire."
Hosea,7,7,"They are all hot as an oven, And devour their judges; All their kings are fallen, There is none among them that calleth unto Me."
Hosea,7,8,"Ephraim, he mixeth himself with the peoples; Ephraim is become a cake not turned."
Hosea,7,9,"Strangers have devoured his strength, And he knoweth it not; Yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, And he knoweth it not."
Hosea,7,10,"And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face; But they have not returned unto the LORD their God, Nor sought Him, for all this."
Hosea,7,11,"And Ephraim is become like a silly dove, without understanding; They call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria."
Hosea,7,12,"Even as they go, I will spread My net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath been made to hear."
Hosea,7,13,"Woe unto them! for they have strayed from Me; Destruction unto them! for they have transgressed against Me; Shall I then redeem them, Seeing they have spoken lies against Me?"
Hosea,7,14,"And they have not cried unto Me with their heart, Though they wail upon their beds; They assemble themselves for corn and wine, they rebel against Me."
Hosea,7,15,"Though I have trained and strengthened their arms, Yet do they devise evil against Me."
Hosea,7,16,"They return, but not upwards; They are become like a deceitful bow; Their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue; This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt."
Hosea,8,1,"Set the horn to thy mouth. As a vulture he cometh against the house of the LORD; Because they have transgressed My covenant, And trespassed against My law."
Hosea,8,2,"Will they cry unto Me: ‘My God, we Israel know Thee’?"
Hosea,8,3,Israel hath cast off that which is good; The enemy shall pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,"They have set up kings, but not from Me, They have made princes, and I knew it not; Of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, That they may be cut off."
Hosea,8,5,"Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off; Mine anger is kindled against them; How long will it be ere they attain to innocency?"
Hosea,8,6,"For from Israel is even this: The craftsman made it, and it is no God; Yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in shivers."
Hosea,8,7,"For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind; It hath no stalk, the bud that shall yield no meal; If so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up."
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up; Now are they become among the nations As a vessel wherein is no value.
Hosea,8,9,"For they are gone up to Assyria, Like a wild ass alone by himself; Ephraim hath hired lovers."
Hosea,8,10,"Yea, though they hire among the nations, Now will I gather them up; And they begin to be minished By reason of the burden of king and princes."
Hosea,8,11,"For Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, Yea, altars have been unto him to sin."

Hosea,8,13,"As for the sacrifices that are made by fire unto Me, Let them sacrifice flesh and eat it, For the LORD accepteth them not. Now will He remember their iniquity, and punish their sins; They shall return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, And builded palaces, And Judah hath multiplied fortified cities; But I will send a fire upon his cities, And it shall devour the castles thereof."

Hosea,9,4,"They shall not pour out wine-offerings to the LORD, Neither shall they be pleasing unto Him; Their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners, All that eat thereof shall be polluted; For their bread shall be for their appetite, It shall not come into the house of the LORD."
Hosea,9,5,"What will ye do in the day of the appointed season, And in the day of the feast of the LORD?"

Hosea,9,7,"The days of visitation are come, The days of recompense are come, Israel shall know it. The prophet is a fool, the man of the spirit is mad! For the multitude of thine iniquity, the enmity is great."
Hosea,9,8,"Ephraim is a watchman with my God; As for the prophet, a fowler’s snare is in all his ways, And enmity in the house of his God."
Hosea,9,9,"They have deeply corrupted themselves, As in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins."
Hosea,9,10,"I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness, I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at her first season; But so soon as they came to Baal-peor, They separated themselves unto the shameful thing, And became detestable like that which they loved."
Hosea,9,11,"As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird; There shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception."

Hosea,9,13,"Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place; But Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the slayer."
Hosea,9,14,"Give them, O LORD, whatsoever Thou wilt give; Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts."

Hosea,10,3,"Surely now shall they say: ‘We have no king; For we feared not the LORD; And the king, what can he do for us?’"
Hosea,10,4,"They speak words, They swear falsely, they make covenants; Thus judgment springeth up as hemlock In the furrows of the field."

Obadiah,1,8,"Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, Destroy the wise men out of Edom, And discernment out of the mount of Esau?"
Obadiah,1,9,"And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, To the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter."
Obadiah,1,10,"For the violence done to thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, And thou shalt be cut off for ever."
Obadiah,1,11,"In the day that thou didst stand aloof, In the day that strangers carried away his substance, And foreigners entered into his gates, And cast lots upon Jerusalem, Even thou wast as one of them."
Obadiah,1,12,"But thou shouldest not have gazed on the day of thy brother In the day of his disaster, Neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah In the day of their destruction; Neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly In the day of distress."
Obadiah,1,13,"Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of My people In the day of their calamity; Yea, thou shouldest not have gazed on their affliction In the day of their calamity, Nor have laid hands on their substance In the day of their calamity."
Obadiah,1,14,"Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, To cut off those of his that escape; Neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his That did remain in the day of distress. The Deliverance of Israel"
Obadiah,1,15,"For the day of the LORD is near upon all the nations; As thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee; Thy dealing shall return upon thine own head."
Obadiah,1,16,"For as ye have drunk upon My holy mountain, So shall all the nations drink continually, Yea, they shall drink, and swallow down, And shall be as though they had not been."
Obadiah,1,17,"But in mount Zion there shall be those that escape, And it shall be holy; And the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions."
Obadiah,1,18,"And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, And the house of Joseph a flame, And the house of Esau for stubble, And they shall kindle in them, and devour them; And there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; For the LORD hath spoken."
Obadiah,1,19,"And they of the South shall possess the mount of Esau, And they of the Lowland the Philistines; And they shall possess the field of Ephraim, And the field of Samaria; And Benjamin shall possess Gilead."
Obadiah,1,20,"And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel, That are among the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath, And the captivity of Jerusalem, that is in Sepharad, Shall possess the cities of the South."
Obadiah,1,21,And saviours shall come up on mount Zion To judge the mount of Esau; And the kingdom shall be the LORD’S.
Jonah,1,1,"Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying:"
Jonah,1,2,"Arise, go to Nineveh, that"
Jonah,1,3,"But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish, from the presence of the LORD. The Great Storm (Acts 27:13–26)"
Jonah,1,4,"But the LORD hurled a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that"
Jonah,1,5,"And the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was"
Jonah,1,6,"So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him: ‘What meanest thou that thou sleepest? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.’"
Jonah,1,7,"And they said every one to his fellow: ‘Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause"
Jonah,1,8,"Then said they unto him: ‘Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us: what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou?"
Jonah,1,9,"And he said unto them: ‘I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.’"
Jonah,1,10,"Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him: ‘What is this that thou hast done?’ For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them. Jonah Cast into the Sea"
Jonah,1,11,"Then said they unto him: ‘What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us?’ for the"
Jonah,1,12,"And he said unto them: ‘Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you; for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.’"
Jonah,1,13,Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not; for the sea grew more
Jonah,1,14,"Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said: ‘We beseech Thee, O LORD, we beseech Thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for Thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased Thee.’"
Jonah,1,15,"So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging."
Jonah,1,16,"Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows."
Jonah,1,17,And the LORD prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
Jonah,2,1,Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly.
Jonah,2,2,"And he said: I called out of mine affliction Unto the LORD, and He answered me; Out of the belly of the nether-world cried I, And Thou heardest my voice."
Jonah,2,3,"For Thou didst cast me into the depth, In the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All Thy waves and Thy billows Passed over me."
Jonah,2,4,And I said: ‘I am cast out From before Thine eyes’; Yet I will look again Toward Thy holy temple.
Jonah,2,5,"The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head."
Jonah,2,6,"I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with her bars closed upon me for ever; Yet hast Thou brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God."
Jonah,2,7,"When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD; And my prayer came in unto Thee, Into Thy holy temple."
Jonah,2,8,They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy.
Jonah,2,9,But I will sacrifice unto Thee With the voice of thanksgiving; That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is of the LORD.
Jonah,2,10,"And the LORD spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land."
Jonah,3,1,"And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying:"
Jonah,3,2,"Arise, go unto Nineveh, that"
Jonah,3,3,"So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’ journey."
Jonah,3,4,"And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he proclaimed, and said: ‘Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.’"
Jonah,3,5,"And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the"
Jonah,3,6,"And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose"
Jonah,3,7,"And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying: ‘Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not feed, nor drink water; 8but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God; yea,"
Jonah,3,9,"Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?’"
Jonah,3,10,"And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which He said He would do unto them; and He did it not."
Jonah,4,1,"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry."
Jonah,4,2,"And he prayed unto the LORD, and said: ‘I pray Thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in mine own country? Therefore I fled beforehand unto Tarshish; for I knew that Thou art a gracious God, and compassionate, long-suffering,"
Jonah,4,3,"Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech"
Jonah,4,4,And the LORD said: ‘Art thou greatly angry?’
Jonah,4,5,"Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth,"
Jonah,4,6,"And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to"
Jonah,4,7,But God prepared a

Jonah,4,9,"And God said to Jonah: ‘Art thou greatly angry for the gourd?’ And he said: ‘I am greatly angry, even"
Jonah,4,10,"And the LORD said: ‘Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night; 11and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?’"
Micah,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem."
Micah,1,2,"Hear, ye peoples, all of you; Hearken, O earth, and all that therein is; And let the Lord GOD be witness against you, The Lord from His holy temple."
Micah,1,3,"For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of His place, And will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth."
Micah,1,4,"And the mountains shall be molten under Him, And the valleys shall be cleft, As wax before the fire, As waters that are poured down a steep place."
Micah,1,5,"For the transgression of Jacob is all this, And for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?"
Micah,1,6,"Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the field, A place for the planting of vineyards; And I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, And I will uncover the foundations thereof."
Micah,1,7,"And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, And all her hires shall be burned with fire, And all her idols will I lay desolate; For of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered them, And unto the hire of a harlot shall they return. Weeping and Mourning"
Micah,1,8,"For this will I wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, And a mourning like the ostriches."
Micah,1,9,"For her wound is incurable; For it is come even unto Judah; It reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem."
Micah,1,10,"Tell it not in Gath, Weep not at all; At Beth-le-aphrah roll thyself in the dust."
Micah,1,11,"Pass ye away, O inhabitant of Saphir, in nakedness and shame; The inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth; The wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the standing-place thereof."
Micah,1,12,For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good; Because evil is come down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.
Micah,1,13,"Bind the chariots to the swift steeds, O inhabitant of Lachish; She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; For the transgressions of Israel are found in thee."
Micah,1,14,Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath; The houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel.
Micah,1,15,"I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee; The glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam."
Micah,1,16,"Make thee bald, and poll thee for the children of thy delight; Enlarge thy baldness as the vulture; For they are gone into captivity from thee."
Micah,2,1,"Woe to them that devise iniquity And work evil upon their beds! When the morning is light, they execute it, Because it is in the power of their hand."
Micah,2,2,"And they covet fields, and seize them; And houses, and take them away; Thus they oppress a man and his house, Even a man and his heritage."
Micah,2,3,"Therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, From which ye shall not remove your necks, Neither shall ye walk upright; for it shall be an evil time."
Micah,2,4,"In that day shall they take up a parable against you, And lament with a doleful lamentation, and say: ‘We are utterly ruined; He changeth the portion of my people; How doth he remove it from me! Instead of restoring our fields, he divideth them.’"
Micah,2,5,Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot In the congregation of the LORD. Reproof of False Prophets (Ezekiel 13:1–16)
Micah,2,6,"Preach ye not’, they preach; ‘They shall not preach of these things, That they shall not take shame.’"
Micah,2,7,"Do I change, O house of Jacob? Is the spirit of the LORD straitened? Are these His doings? Do not My words do good to him that walketh uprightly?"
Micah,2,8,"But of late My people is risen up as an enemy; With the garment ye strip also the mantle From them that pass by securely, so that they are as men returning from war."
Micah,2,9,The women of My people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; From their young children ye take away My glory for ever.
Micah,2,10,"Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; Because of the uncleanness thereof, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction."
Micah,2,11,If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie: ‘I will preach unto thee of wine and of strong drink’; He shall even be the preacher of this people. The Remnant of Israel (Micah 5:7–15)
Micah,2,12,"I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will render them all as sheep in a fold; As a flock in the midst of their pasture; They shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men."
Micah,2,13,"The breaker is gone up before them; They have broken forth and passed on, By the gate, and are gone out thereat; And their king is passed on before them, And the LORD at the head of them."
Micah,3,1,"And I said: Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, And rulers of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know justice?"
Micah,3,2,"Who hate the good, and love the evil; Who rob their skin from off them, And their flesh from off their bones;"
Micah,3,3,"Who also eat the flesh of my people, And flay their skin from off them, And break their bones; Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, And as flesh within the caldron."
Micah,3,4,"Then shall they cry unto the LORD, But He will not answer them; Yea, He will hide His face from them at that time, According as they have wrought evil in their doings."
Micah,3,5,"Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people to err; That cry: ‘Peace’, when their teeth have any thing to bite; And whoso putteth not into their mouths, They even prepare war against him:"
Micah,3,6,"Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; And it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; And the sun shall go down upon the prophets, And the day shall be black over them."
Micah,3,7,"And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; Yea, they shall all cover their upper lips; For there shall be no answer of God."
Micah,3,8,"But I truly am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, And of justice, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, And to Israel his sin."
Micah,3,9,"Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, And rulers of the house of Israel, That abhor justice, and pervert all equity;"
Micah,3,10,"That build up Zion with blood, And Jerusalem with iniquity."
Micah,3,11,"The heads thereof judge for reward, And the priests thereof teach for hire, And the prophets thereof divine for money; Yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say: ‘Is not the LORD in the midst of us? No evil shall come upon us’?"
Micah,3,12,"Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, And Jerusalem shall become heaps, And the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest."
Micah,4,1,"But in the end of days it shall come to pass, That the mountain of the LORD’S house shall be established as the top of the mountains, And it shall be exalted above the hills; And peoples shall flow unto it."
Micah,4,2,"And many nations shall go and say: ‘Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, And to the house of the God of Jacob; And He will teach us of His ways, And we will walk in His paths’; For out of Zion shall go forth the law, And the word of the LORD from Jerusalem."
Micah,4,3,"And He shall judge between many peoples, And shall decide concerning mighty nations afar off; And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, And their spears into pruninghooks; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, Neither shall they learn war any more."
Micah,4,4,But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; And none shall make them afraid; For the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken.
Micah,4,5,"For let all the peoples walk each one in the name of its god, But we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever. The Restoration of Zion (Zechariah 8:1–23)"
Micah,4,6,"In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, And I will gather her that is driven away, And her that I have afflicted;"
Micah,4,7,"And I will make her that halted a remnant, And her that was cast far off a mighty nation; And the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from thenceforth even for ever."
Micah,4,8,"And thou, Migdal-eder, the hill of the daughter of Zion, Unto thee shall it come; Yea, the former dominion shall come, The kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem."
Micah,4,9,"Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no King in thee, Is thy Counsellor perished, That pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail?"
Micah,4,10,"Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, Like a woman in travail; For now shalt thou go forth out of the city, And shalt dwell in the field, And shalt come even unto Babylon; There shalt thou be rescued; There shall the LORD redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies."
Micah,4,11,"And now many nations are assembled against thee, That say: ‘Let her be defiled, and let our eye gaze upon Zion.’"
Micah,4,12,"But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, Neither understand they His counsel; For He hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor."
Micah,4,13,"Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; For I will make thy horn iron, And I will make thy hoofs brass; And thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples; And thou shalt devote their gain unto the LORD, And their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth."
Micah,5,1,"Now shalt thou gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops; They have laid siege against us; They smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek."
Micah,5,2,"But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, Which art little to be among the thousands of Judah, Out of thee shall one come forth unto Me that is to be ruler in Israel; Whose goings forth are from of old, from ancient days."
Micah,5,3,"Therefore will He give them up, Until the time that she who travaileth hath brought forth; Then the residue of his brethren shall return with the children of Israel."
Micah,5,4,"And he shall stand, and shall feed his flock in the strength of the LORD, In the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; And they shall abide, for then shall he be great unto the ends of the earth."
Micah,5,5,"And this shall be peace: When the Assyrian shall come into our land, And when he shall tread in our palaces, Then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, And eight princes among men."
Micah,5,6,"And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, And the land of Nimrod with the keen-edged sword; And he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, And when he treadeth within our border. The Remnant of Jacob (Micah 2:12–13)"
Micah,5,7,"And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples, As dew from the LORD, as showers upon the grass, That are not looked for from man, Nor awaited at the hands of the sons of men."
Micah,5,8,"And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, As a lion among the beasts of the forest, As a young lion among the flocks of sheep, Who, if he go through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, And there is none to deliver."
Micah,5,9,"Let Thy hand be lifted up above Thine adversaries, And let all Thine enemies be cut off."
Micah,5,10,"And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, That I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, And will destroy thy chariots;"
Micah,5,11,"And I will cut off the cities of thy land, And will throw down all thy strongholds;"
Micah,5,12,And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand; And thou shalt have no more soothsayers;
Micah,5,13,And I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee; And thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands.
Micah,5,14,And I will pluck up thy Asherim out of the midst of thee; And I will destroy thine enemies.
Micah,5,15,"And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the nations, Because they hearkened not."
Micah,6,1,"Hear ye now what the LORD saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, And let the hills hear thy voice."
Micah,6,2,"Hear, O ye mountains, the LORD’S controversy, And ye enduring rocks, the foundations of the earth; For the LORD hath a controversy with His people, And He will plead with Israel."
Micah,6,3,"O My people, what have I done unto thee? And wherein have I wearied thee? Testify against Me."
Micah,6,4,"For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, And redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, And I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam."
Micah,6,5,"O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; From Shittim unto Gilgal, That ye may know the righteous acts of the LORD."
Micah,6,6,"Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, And bow myself before God on high? Shall I come before Him with burnt-offerings, With calves of a year old?"
Micah,6,7,"Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, With ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?’"
Micah,6,8,"It hath been told thee, O man, what is good, And what the LORD doth require of thee: Only to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God. The Punishment of Israel"
Micah,6,9,"Hark! the LORD crieth unto the city—And it is wisdom to have regard for Thy name—Hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it."
Micah,6,10,"Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, And the scant measure that is abominable?"
Micah,6,11,"Shall I be pure with wicked balances, And with a bag of deceitful weights?’"
Micah,6,12,"For the rich men thereof are full of violence, And the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth."
Micah,6,13,Therefore I also do smite thee with a grievous wound; I do make thee desolate because of thy sins.
Micah,6,14,"Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; And thy sickness shall be in thine inward parts; And thou shalt conceive, but shalt not bring forth; And whomsoever thou bringest forth will I give up to the sword."
Micah,6,15,"Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; Thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; And the vintage, but shalt not drink wine."
Micah,6,16,"For the statutes of Omri are kept, And all the works of the house of Ahab, And ye walk in their counsels; That I may make thee an astonishment, And the inhabitants thereof a hissing; And ye shall bear the reproach of My people."
Micah,7,1,"Woe is me! for I am as the last of the summer fruits, As the grape gleanings of the vintage; There is no cluster to eat; Nor first-ripe fig which my soul desireth."
Micah,7,2,"The godly man is perished out of the earth, And the upright among men is no more; They all lie in wait for blood; They hunt every man his brother with a net."
Micah,7,3,"Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; The prince asketh, and the judge is ready for a reward; And the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul; Thus they weave it together."
Micah,7,4,"The best of them is as a brier; The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge; The day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; Now shall be their perplexity."
Micah,7,5,"Trust ye not in a friend, Put ye not confidence in a familiar friend; Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom."
Micah,7,6,"For the son dishonoureth the father, The daughter riseth up against her mother, The daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; A man’s enemies are the men of his own house. Israel’s Confession and Comfort"
Micah,7,7,"But as for me, I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation; My God will hear me."
Micah,7,8,"Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy; Though I am fallen, I shall arise; Though I sit in darkness, the LORD is a light unto me."
Micah,7,9,"I will bear the indignation of the LORD, Because I have sinned against Him; Until He plead my cause, and execute judgment for me; He will bring me forth to the light, And I shall behold His righteousness."
Micah,7,10,"Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her; Who said unto me: Where is the LORD thy God? Mine eyes shall gaze upon her; Now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.’"
Micah,7,11,"The day for building thy walls, even that day, shall be far removed.’"
Micah,7,12,"There shall be a day when they shall come unto thee, From Assyria even to the cities of Egypt, And from Egypt even to the River, And from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain."
Micah,7,13,"And the land shall be desolate for them that dwell therein, Because of the fruit of their doings. God’s Compassion on Israel"
Micah,7,14,"Tend Thy people with Thy staff, the flock of Thy heritage, That dwell solitarily, as a forest in the midst of the fruitful field; Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old."
Micah,7,15,As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt Will I show unto him marvellous things.’
Micah,7,16,"The nations shall see and be put to shame for all their might; They shall lay their hand upon their mouth, Their ears shall be deaf."
Micah,7,17,"They shall lick the dust like a serpent; Like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; They shall come with fear unto the LORD our God, And shall be afraid because of Thee."
Micah,7,18,"Who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth the iniquity, And passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retaineth not His anger for ever, Because He delighteth in mercy."
Micah,7,19,He will again have compassion upon us; He will subdue our iniquities; And Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
Micah,7,20,"Thou wilt show faithfulness to Jacob, mercy to Abraham, As Thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old."

Nahum,1,3,"The LORD is long-suffering, and great in power, And will by no means clear the guilty; The LORD, in the whirlwind and in the storm is His way, And the clouds are the dust of His feet."
Nahum,1,4,"He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, And drieth up all the rivers; Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, And the flower of Lebanon languisheth."

Nahum,1,7,"The LORD is good, A stronghold in the day of trouble; And He knoweth them that take refuge in Him."
Nahum,1,8,"But with an overrunning flood He will make a full end of the place thereof, And darkness shall pursue His enemies."
Nahum,1,9,What do ye devise against the LORD? He will make a full end; Trouble shall not rise up the second time.
Nahum,1,10,"For though they be like tangled thorns, And be drunken according to their drink, They shall be devoured as stubble fully dry."
Nahum,1,11,"Out of thee came he forth, That deviseth evil against the LORD, That counselleth wickedness."

Nahum,1,13,"And now will I break his yoke from off thee, And will burst thy bonds in sunder."
Nahum,1,14,"And the LORD hath given commandment concerning thee, That no more of thy name be sown; Out of the house of thy god will I cut off The graven image and the molten image; I will make thy grave; for thou art become worthless."
Nahum,1,15,"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him That bringeth good tidings, that announceth peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah, Perform thy vows; For the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; He is utterly cut off."
Nahum,2,1,"A maul is come up before thy face; Guard the defences, Watch the way, make thy loins strong, Fortify thy power mightily!—"
Nahum,2,2,"For the LORD restoreth the pride of Jacob, As the pride of Israel; For the emptiers have emptied them out, And marred their vine-branches.—"
Nahum,2,3,"The shield of his mighty men is made red, The valiant men are in scarlet; The chariots are fire of steel in the day of his preparation, And the cypress spears are made to quiver."
Nahum,2,4,"The chariots rush madly in the streets, They jostle one against another in the broad places; The appearance of them is like torches, They run to and fro like the lightnings."

Nahum,2,10,"She is empty, and void, and waste; And the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, And convulsion is in all loins, And the faces of them all have gathered blackness."
Nahum,2,11,"Where is the den of the lions, Which was the feeding-place of the young lions, Where the lion and the lioness walked, and the lion’s whelp, And none made them afraid?"
Nahum,2,12,"The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, And strangled for his lionesses, And filled his caves with prey, And his dens with ravin."
Nahum,2,13,"Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, And I will burn her chariots in the smoke, And the sword shall devour thy young lions; And I will cut off thy prey from the earth, And the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard."
Nahum,3,1,Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lies and rapine; The prey departeth not.
Nahum,3,2,"Hark! the whip, and hark! the rattling of the wheels; And prancing horses, and bounding chariots;"
Nahum,3,3,"The horseman charging, And the flashing sword, and the glittering spear; And a multitude of slain, and a heap of carcases; And there is no end of the corpses, and they stumble upon their corpses;"
Nahum,3,4,"Because of the multitude of the harlotries of the well-favoured harlot, The mistress of witchcrafts, That selleth nations through her harlotries, And families through her witchcrafts."
Nahum,3,5,"Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, And I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face, And I will shew the nations thy nakedness, And the kingdoms thy shame."
Nahum,3,6,"And I will cast detestable things upon thee, and make thee vile, And will make thee as dung."
Nahum,3,7,"And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee Shall flee from thee, And say: ‘Nineveh is laid waste; Who will bemoan her? Whence shall I seek comforters for thee?’"
Nahum,3,8,"Art thou better than No-amon, That was situate among the rivers, That had the waters round about her; Whose rampart was the sea, and of the sea her wall?"
Nahum,3,9,"Ethiopia and Egypt were thy strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers."
Nahum,3,10,"Yet was she carried away, She went into captivity; Her young children also were dashed in pieces At the head of all the streets; And they cast lots for her honourable men, And all her great men were bound in chains."
Nahum,3,11,"Thou also shalt be drunken, Thou shalt swoon; Thou also shalt seek a refuge Because of the enemy."

Habakkuk,1,1,THE burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
Habakkuk,1,2,"How long, O LORD, shall I cry, And Thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto Thee of violence, And Thou wilt not save."
Habakkuk,1,3,"Why dost Thou show me iniquity, And beholdest mischief? And why are spoiling and violence before me? So that there is strife, and contention ariseth."
Habakkuk,1,4,"Therefore the law is slacked, And right doth never go forth; For the wicked doth beset the righteous; Therefore right goeth forth perverted. The LORD’s Answer"
Habakkuk,1,5,"Look ye among the nations, and behold, And wonder marvellously; For, behold, a work shall be wrought in your days, Which ye will not believe though it be told you."
Habakkuk,1,6,"For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, That bitter and impetuous nation, That march through the breadth of the earth, To possess dwelling-places that are not theirs."
Habakkuk,1,7,They are terrible and dreadful; Their law and their majesty proceed from themselves.
Habakkuk,1,8,"Their horses also are swifter than leopards, And are more fierce than the wolves of the desert; And their horsemen spread themselves; Yea, their horsemen come from far, They fly as a vulture that hasteth to devour."
Habakkuk,1,9,They come all of them for violence; Their faces are set eagerly as the east wind; And they gather captives as the sand.
Habakkuk,1,10,"And they scoff at kings, And princes are a derision unto them; They deride every stronghold, For they heap up earth, and take it."
Habakkuk,1,11,"Then their spirit doth pass over and transgress, And they become guilty: Even they who impute their might unto their god. Habakkuk’s Second Complaint (Psalm 11:1–7)"
Habakkuk,1,12,"Art not Thou from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O LORD, Thou hast ordained them for judgment, And Thou, O Rock, hast established them for correction."
Habakkuk,1,13,"Thou that art of eyes too pure to behold evil, And that canst not look on mischief, Wherefore lookest Thou, when they deal treacherously, And holdest Thy peace, when the wicked swalloweth up The man that is more righteous than he;"
Habakkuk,1,14,"And makest men as the fishes of the sea, As the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?"
Habakkuk,1,15,"They take up all of them with the angle, They catch them in their net, And gather them in their drag; Therefore they rejoice and exult."
Habakkuk,1,16,"Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, And offer unto their drag; Because by them their portion is fat, And their food plenteous."
Habakkuk,1,17,"Shall they therefore empty their net, And not spare to slay the nations continually?"
Habakkuk,2,1,"I will stand upon my watch, And set me upon the tower, And will look out to see what He will speak by me, And what I shall answer when I am reproved."
Habakkuk,2,2,"And the LORD answered me, and said: ‘Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, That a man may read it swiftly."
Habakkuk,2,3,"For the vision is yet for the appointed time, And it declareth of the end, and doth not lie; Though it tarry, wait for it; Because it will surely come, it will not delay.’"
Habakkuk,2,4,"Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him; But the righteous shall live by his faith."
Habakkuk,2,5,"Yea, moreover, wine is a treacherous dealer; The haughty man abideth not; He who enlargeth his desire as the nether-world, And is as death, and cannot be satisfied, But gathereth unto him all nations, And heapeth unto him all peoples. Woe to the Chaldeans"
Habakkuk,2,6,"Shall not all these take up a parable against him, And a taunting riddle against him, And say: ‘Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! How long? and that ladeth himself with many pledges!’"
Habakkuk,2,7,"Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall exact interest of thee, And awake that shall violently shake thee, And thou shalt be for booties unto them?"
Habakkuk,2,8,"Because thou hast spoiled many nations, All the remnant of the peoples shall spoil thee; Because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, To the city and to all that dwell therein."
Habakkuk,2,9,"Woe to him that gaineth evil gains for his house, That he may set his nest on high, That he may be delivered from the power of evil!"
Habakkuk,2,10,"Thou hast devised shame to thy house, By cutting off many peoples, And hast forfeited thy life."
Habakkuk,2,11,"For the stone shall cry out of the wall, And the beam out of the timber shall answer it."
Habakkuk,2,12,"Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, And establisheth a city by iniquity!"
Habakkuk,2,13,"Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts That the peoples labour for the fire, And the nations weary themselves for vanity?"
Habakkuk,2,14,"For the earth shall be filled With the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, As the waters cover the sea."
Habakkuk,2,15,"Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, That puttest thy venom thereto, and makest him drunken also, That thou mayest look on their nakedness!"
Habakkuk,2,16,"Thou art filled with shame instead of glory, Drink thou also, and be uncovered; The cup of the LORD’S right hand shall be turned unto thee, And filthiness shall be upon thy glory."
Habakkuk,2,17,"For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, And the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; Because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, To the city and to all that dwell therein."
Habakkuk,2,18,"What profiteth the graven image, That the maker thereof hath graven it, Even the molten image, and the teacher of lies; That the maker of his work trusteth therein, To make dumb idols?"
Habakkuk,2,19,"Woe unto him that saith to the wood: ‘Awake’, To the dumb stone: ‘Arise!’ Can this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, And there is no breath at all in the midst of it."
Habakkuk,2,20,But the LORD is in His holy temple; Let all the earth keep silence before Him.
Habakkuk,3,1,A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. Upon Shigionoth.
Habakkuk,3,2,"O LORD, I have heard the report of Thee, and am afraid; O LORD, revive Thy work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember compassion."
Habakkuk,3,3,"God cometh from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah His glory covereth the heavens, And the earth is full of His praise."
Habakkuk,3,4,And a brightness appeareth as the light; Rays hath He at His side; And there is the hiding of His power.
Habakkuk,3,5,"Before him goeth the pestilence, And fiery bolts go forth at His feet."
Habakkuk,3,6,"He standeth, and shaketh the earth, He beholdeth, and maketh the nations to tremble; And the everlasting mountains are dashed in pieces, The ancient hills do bow; His goings are as of old."
Habakkuk,3,7,I see the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian do tremble.
Habakkuk,3,8,"Is it, O LORD, that against the rivers, Is it that Thine anger is kindled against the rivers, Or Thy wrath against the sea? That Thou dost ride upon Thy horses, Upon Thy chariots of victory?"
Habakkuk,3,9,Thy bow is made quite bare; Sworn are the rods of the word. Selah. Thou dost cleave the earth with rivers.
Habakkuk,3,10,"The mountains have seen Thee, and they tremble; The tempest of waters floweth over; the deep uttereth its voice, And lifteth up its hands on high."
Habakkuk,3,11,"The sun and moon stand still in their habitation; At the light of Thine arrows as they go, At the shining of Thy glittering spear."
Habakkuk,3,12,"Thou marchest through the earth in indignation, Thou threshest the nations in anger."
Habakkuk,3,13,"Thou art come forth for the deliverance of Thy people, For the deliverance of Thine anointed; Thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked, Uncovering the foundation even unto the neck. Selah"
Habakkuk,3,14,"Thou hast stricken through with his own rods the head of his rulers, That come as a whirlwind to scatter me; Whose rejoicing is as to devour the poor secretly."
Habakkuk,3,15,"Thou hast trodden the sea with Thy horses, The foaming of mighty waters."
Habakkuk,3,16,"When I heard, mine inward parts trembled, My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entereth into my bones, And I tremble where I stand; That I should wait for the day of trouble, When he cometh up against the people that he invadeth. Habakkuk Rejoices"
Habakkuk,3,17,"For though the fig-tree shall not blossom, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labour of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls;"
Habakkuk,3,18,"Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will exult in the God of my salvation."
Habakkuk,3,19,"God, the Lord, is my strength, And He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, And He maketh me to walk upon my high places. For the Leader. With my string-music."

Zephaniah,1,13,"Therefore their wealth shall become a booty, And their houses a desolation; Yea, they shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them, And they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine thereof."
Zephaniah,1,14,"The great day of the LORD is near, It is near and hasteth greatly, Even the voice of the day of the LORD, Wherein the mighty man crieth bitterly."
Zephaniah,1,15,"That day is a day of wrath, A day of trouble and distress, A day of wasteness and desolation, A day of darkness and gloominess, A day of clouds and thick darkness,"
Zephaniah,1,16,"A day of the horn and alarm, Against the fortified cities, and against the high towers."
Zephaniah,1,17,"And I will bring distress upon men, That they shall walk like the blind, Because they have sinned against the LORD; And their blood shall be poured out as dust, And their flesh as dung."
Zephaniah,1,18,"Neither their silver nor their gold Shall be able to deliver them In the day of the LORD’S wrath; But the whole earth shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy; For He will make and end, yea, a terrible end, Of all them that dwell in the earth."

Zephaniah,2,4,"For Gaza shall be forsaken, And Ashkelon a desolation; They shall drive out Ashdod at the noonday, And Ekron shall be rooted up."
Zephaniah,2,5,"Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, The nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant."
Zephaniah,2,6,"And the sea-coast shall be pastures, Even meadows for shepherds, and folds for flocks."

Zephaniah,2,15,"This is the joyous city That dwelt without care, That said in her heart: ‘I am, and there is none else beside me’; How is she become a desolation, A place for beasts to lie down in! Every one that passeth by her Shall hiss, and wag his hand."

Zephaniah,3,2,"She hearkened not the voice, She received not correction; She trusted not in the LORD, She drew not near to her God."
Zephaniah,3,3,"Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; Her judges are wolves of the desert, They leave not a bone for the morrow."

Zephaniah,3,7,"I said: ‘Surely thou wilt fear Me, Thou wilt receive correction; So her dwelling shall not be cut off, Despite all that I have visited upon her’; But they betimes corrupted all their doings."
Zephaniah,3,8,"Therefore wait ye for Me, saith the LORD, Until the day that I rise up to the prey; For My determination is to gather the nations, That I may assemble the kingdoms, To pour upon them Mine indignation, Even all My fierce anger; For all the earth shall be devoured With the fire of My jealousy.

Zephaniah,3,12,"And I will leave in the midst of thee An afflicted and poor people, And they shall take refuge in the name of the LORD."
Zephaniah,3,13,"The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, Nor speak lies, Neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; For they shall feed and lie down, And none shall make them afraid. Israel’s Restoration"
Zephaniah,3,14,"Sing, O daughter of Zion, Shout, O Israel; Be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem."
Zephaniah,3,15,"The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, He hath cast out thine enemy; The King of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee; Thou shalt not fear evil any more."
Zephaniah,3,16,"In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: ‘Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack."
Zephaniah,3,17,"The LORD thy God is in the midst of thee, A Mighty One who will save; He will rejoice over thee with joy, He will be silent in His love, He will joy over thee with singing.’"
Zephaniah,3,18,"I will gather them that are far from the appointed season, who are of thee, That hast borne the burden of reproach."
Zephaniah,3,19,"Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; And I will save her that is lame, And gather her that was driven away; And I will make them to be a praise and a name, Whose shame hath been in all the earth."
Zephaniah,3,20,"At that time will I bring you in, And at that time will I gather you; For I will make you to be a name and a praise Among all the peoples of the earth, When I turn your captivity before your eyes, Saith the LORD."

Matthew,1,24,"When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded, and brought home his wife, 25but did not live with her until she had given birth to a son. The child’s name he called JESUS."
Matthew,2,1,"Now after the birth of Jesus, which took place at Bethlehem in Judaea in the reign of King Herod, excitement was produced in Jerusalem by the arrival of certain Magi from the east, 2inquiring, “Where is the newly born king of the Jews? For we have seen his Star in the east, and have come here to do"

Matthew,2,4,"So he assembled all the High Priests and Scribes of the people, and anxiously asked them where the Christ was to be born. 5“At Bethlehem in Judaea,” they replied; “for so it stands written in the words of the Prophet, 6“’And thou, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, by no means the least honorable art thou among princely places in Judah! For from thee shall come a prince—one who shall be the Shepherd of My People Israel.’”"
Matthew,2,7,Thereupon Herod sent privately for the Magi and ascertained from them the exact time of the star’s

Matthew,2,13,"When they were gone, and angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise: take the babe and His mother and escape to Egypt, and remain there till I bring you word. For Herod is about to make search for the child in order to destroy Him.”"
Matthew,2,14,So Joseph roused himself and took the babe and His mother by night and departed into Egypt.

Matthew,3,1,"About this time John the Baptist made his appearance, preaching in the Desert of Judaea. 2“Repent,” he said, “for the Kingdom of the Heavens is now close at hand.”"
Matthew,3,3,"He it is who was spoken of through the Prophet Isaiah when he said, “The voice of one crying aloud, ‘In the desert prepare ye a road for the Lord: make His highway straight.’”"

Matthew,3,13,"Just at that time Jesus, coming from Galilee to the Jordan, presents Himself to John to be baptized"
Matthew,3,14,"John protested. “It is I,” he said, “who have need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” 15“Let it be so on this occasion,” Jesus replied; “for so we ought to fulfil every religious duty.” Then he consented; 16and Jesus was baptized, and immediately went up from the water. At that moment the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him, 17while a voice came from Heaven, saying, “This is My Son, the dearly loved, in whom is My delight.”"
Matthew,4,1,At that time Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the Desert in order to be tempted by the Devil.
Matthew,4,2,There
Matthew,4,3,"So the Tempter came and said, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to turn into loaves.” 4“It is written,” replied Jesus, “’It is not on bread alone that a man shall live, but on whatsoever God shall appoint.’”"
Matthew,4,5,"Then the Devil took Him to the Holy City and caused Him to stand on the roof of the Temple, 6and said, “If you are God’s Son, throw yourself down; for it is written, “’To His angels He will give orders concerning thee, and on their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any moment thou shouldst strike thy foot against a stone.’” 7“Again it is written,” replied Jesus, “’Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the proof.’”"
Matthew,4,8,"Then the Devil took Him to the top of an exceedingly lofty mountain, from which he caused Him to see all the Kingdoms of the world and their splendour, 9and said to Him, “All this I will give you, if you will kneel down and do me homage.” 10“Begone, Satan!” Jesus replied; “for it is written, ‘To the Lord"
Matthew,4,11,"Thereupon the Devil left Him, and angels at once came and ministered to Him. Jesus Begins His Ministry (Isaiah 9:1–7; Mark 1:14–15; Luke 4:14–15)"
Matthew,4,12,"Now when Jesus heard that John was thrown into prison, He withdrew into Galilee, 13and leaving Nazareth He went and settled at Capernaum, a town by the Lake on the frontiers of Zebulun and Naphtali, 14in order that these words, spoken through the Prophet Isaiah, might be fulfilled, 15“Zebulun’s land and Naphtali’s land; the road by the Lake; the country beyond the Jordan; Galilee of the Nations!"
Matthew,4,16,"The people who were dwelling in darkness have seen a brilliant light; and on those who were dwelling in the region of the shadow of death, on them light has dawned.”"
Matthew,4,17,"From that time Jesus began to preach. “Repent,” He said, “for the Kingdom of the Heavens is now close at hand.” The First Disciples (Mark 1:16–20; Luke 5:1–11; John 1:35–42)"
Matthew,4,18,And walking along the shore of the Lake of Galilee He saw two brothers—Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew—throwing a drag-net into the Lake; for they were fishers.

Matthew,5,16,"Just so let your light shine before all men, in order that they may see your holy lives and may give glory to your Father who is in Heaven. The Fulfillment of the Law 17“Do not for a moment suppose that I have come to abrogate the Law or the Prophets: I have not"
Matthew,5,18,"Solemnly I tell you that until Heaven and earth pass away, not one iota or smallest detail will pass away from the Law until all has taken place."
Matthew,5,19,"Whoever therefore breaks one of these least commandments and teaches others to break them, will be called the least in the Kingdom of the Heavens; but whoever practises them and teaches them, he will be acknowledged as great in the Kingdom of the Heavens."
Matthew,5,20,"For I assure you that unless your righteousness greatly surpasses that of the Scribes and the Pharisees, you will certainly not find entrance into the Kingdom of the Heavens.

Matthew,19,29,"And whoever has forsaken houses, or brothers or sisters, or father or mother, or children or lands, for my sake, shall receive many times as much and shall have as his inheritance the Life of the Ages. 30“But many who are now first will be last, and many who are now last will be first."
Matthew,20,3,About nine o’clock he went out and saw others loitering in the market-place.
Matthew,20,4,"To these also he said, “’You also, go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ 5“So they went."
Matthew,20,6,"And going out about five o’clock he found others loitering, and he asked them, “’Why have you been standing here all day long, doing nothing?’ 7“’Because no one has hired us,’ they replied. “’You also, go into the vineyard,’ he said. 8“When evening came, the master said to his steward, “’Call the men and pay them their wages. Begin with the last set and finish with the first.’ 9“When those came who had begun at five o’clock, they received a shilling apiece; 10and when the first came, they expected to get more, but they also each"

Matthew,20,17,"Jesus was now going up to Jerusalem, and He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them, 18“We are going up to Jerusalem, and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the High Priests and Scribes. They will condemn Him to death, 19and hand Him over to the Gentiles to be made sport of and scourged and crucified; and on the third day He will be raised to life.” A Mother’s Request (Mark 10:35–45)"
Matthew,20,20,"Then the mother of the sons of Zabdi came to Him with her sons, and knelt before Him to make a request of Him. 21“What is it you desire?” He asked. “Command,” she replied, “that these my two sons may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your Kingdom.” 22“None of you know what you are asking for,” said Jesus; “can you drink out of the cup from which I am about to drink?” “We can,” they replied. 23“You shall drink out of my cup,” He said, “but a seat at my right hand or at my left it is not for me to allot, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”"

Matthew,20,29,"As they were leaving Jericho, an immense crowd following Him, 30two blind men sitting by the roadside heard that it was Jesus who was passing by, and cried aloud, “Sir, Son of David, pity us.”"
Matthew,20,31,"The people angrily tried to silence them, but they cried all the louder. “O Sir, Son of David, pity us,”"
Matthew,20,32,"So Jesus stood still and called to them. “What shall I do for you?” He asked. 33“Sir, let our"
Matthew,20,34,"Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him."
Matthew,21,1,"When they were come near Jerusalem and had arrived at Bethphage and the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of the disciples on in front, 2saying to them, “Go to the village you see facing you, and as you"

Matthew,21,6,"So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them: 7they brought the she-ass and the foal, and threw their outer garments on them. So He sat on them; 8and most of the crowd kept spreading their garments along the road, while others cut branches from the trees and carpeted the road with them, 9and the multitudes—some of the people preceding Him and some following—sang aloud, “God save the Son of David! Blessings on Him who comes in the Lord’s name! God in the highest Heavens save Him!”"
Matthew,21,10,"When He thus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was thrown into commotion, every one inquiring, “Who is this?” 11“This is Jesus, the Prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee,” replied the crowds. Jesus Cleanses the Temple (Mark 11:15–19; Luke 19:45–48; John 2:12–25)"
Matthew,21,12,"Entering the Temple, Jesus drove out all who were buying and selling there, and overturned the money-changers’ tables and the seats of the pigeon-dealers. 13“It is written,” He said, “’My House shall be called the House of Prayer’, but you are making it a robbers’ cave.”"
Matthew,21,14,"And the blind and the lame came to Him in the Temple, and He cured them."
Matthew,21,15,"But when the High Priests and the Scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done and the children who were crying aloud in the Temple, “God save the Son of David,” they were filled with indignation. 16“Do you hear,” they asked Him, “what these children are saying?” “Yes,” He replied; “have you never read, ‘Out of the"

Matthew,21,18,"Early in the morning as He was on His way to return to the city He was hungry, 19and seeing a fig- tree on the road-side He went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. “On you,” He said, “no fruit shall ever again grow.” And immediately the fig-tree withered away."
Matthew,21,20,"When the disciples saw it they exclaimed in astonishment, “How instantaneously the fig-tree has withered away!” 21“I solemnly tell you,” said Jesus, “that if you have an unwavering faith, you shall not only perform such a miracle as this of the fig-tree, but that even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be thou lifted up and hurled into the sea,’ it shall be done; 22and everything, whatever it be, that you ask for in your prayers, if you have faith, you shall obtain.” Jesus’ Authority Challenged (Mark 11:27–33; Luke 20:1–8)"
Matthew,21,23,"He entered the Temple; and while He was teaching, the High Priests and the Elders of the people came to Him and asked Him, “By what authority are you doing these things? and who gave you this authority?” 24“And I also have a question to ask *you*,” replied Jesus, “and if you answer me, I in turn"
Matthew,21,25,"John’s Baptism, whence was it?—had it a heavenly or a human origin?” So they debated the matter among themselves. “If we say ‘a heavenly origin,’” they argued, “he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ 26and if we say ‘a human origin’ we have"

The Parable of the Wicked Tenants (Mark 12:1–12; Luke 20:9–18) 33“Listen to another parable. There was a householder who planted a vineyard, made a fence round it, dug a wine-tank in it, and built a strong lodge; then let the place to vine-dressers, and went abroad."
Matthew,21,34,"When vintage-time approached, he sent his servants to the vine-dressers to receive his share of the grapes; 35but the vine-dressers seized the servants, and one they cruelly beat, one they killed, one"
Matthew,21,36,Again he sent another party of servants more numerous than the first; and
Matthew,21,37,"Later still he sent to them his son, saying, “’They will respect my son.’ 38“But the vine-dressers, when they saw the son, said to one another, “’Here is the heir: come, let us kill him and get his inheritance.’ 39“So they seized him, dragged him out of the vineyard,"
Matthew,21,40,"When then the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers?” 41“He will put the wretches to a wretched death,” was the reply, “and will entrust the vineyard to other vine-dressers who will render the produce to him at the vintage season.” 42“Have you never read in the Scriptures,” said Jesus, “’The Stone which the builders rejected has been made the Cornerstone: this Cornerstone came from the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes’? 43“That, I tell you, is the reason why the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and given to a"
Matthew,21,44,He who falls on this stone will be severely hurt; but he on whom it falls will be utterly crushed.”
Matthew,21,45,"After listening to His parables the High Priests and the Pharisees perceived that He was speaking about them; 46but though they were eager to lay hands upon Him, they were afraid of the people, for by them He was regarded as a Prophet."
Matthew,22,1,"Again Jesus spoke to them in figurative language. 2“The Kingdom of the Heavens,” He said, “may be compared to a king who celebrated the marriage of his son, 3and sent his servants to call the invited guests to the wedding, but they were unwilling to come. 4“Again he sent other servants with a message to those who were invited. “’My breakfast is now ready,” he said, ‘my bullocks and fat cattle are killed, and every preparation is made: come to the wedding.’ 5“They however gave no heed, but went, one to his home in the country, another to"

Matthew,22,8,"Then he said to his servants, “’The wedding banquet is ready, but those who were invited were"
Matthew,22,9,"Go out therefore to the crossroads, and everybody you meet invite to the wedding.’ 10“So they went out into the roads and gathered together all they could find, both bad and good, and the banqueting hall was filled with guests. 11“Now the king came in to see the guests; and among them he discovered one who was not wearing a wedding-robe. 12“’My friend,’ he said, ‘how is it that you came in here without a wedding robe?’ 13“The man stood speechless. Then the king said to the servants, “’Bind him hand and foot and fling him into the darkness outside: there will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.’ 14“For there are many called, but few chosen.” Paying Taxes to Caesar (Mark 12:13–17; Luke 20:19–26)"
Matthew,22,15,Then the Pharisees went and consulted together how they might entrap Him in His conversation.

Matthew,22,33,"All the crowd heard this, and were filled with amazement at His teaching. The Greatest Commandment (Deuteronomy 6:1–19; Mark 12:28–34)"
Matthew,22,34,"Now the Pharisees came up when they heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, 35and one of them, an expounder of the Law, asked Him as a test question, 36“Teacher, which is the greatest Commandment in the Law?” 37“’Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,’” He answered, “’with thy whole"
Matthew,22,38,This is the greatest and foremost Commandment.

Matthew,22,41,"While the Pharisees were still assembled there, Jesus put a question to them. 42“What think you about the Christ,” He said, “whose son is He?” “David’s,” they replied. 43“How then,” He asked, “does David, taught by the Spirit, call Him Lord, when he says, 44“’The Lord said to my Lord, sit at My right hand until I have put thy foes beneath thy feet’?"
Matthew,22,46,"No one could say a word in reply, nor from that day did any one venture again to put a question to Him."

Matthew,23,11,"He who is the greatest among you shall be your servant; 12and one who exalts himself shall be abased, while one who abases himself shall be exalted. 13“But alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you lock the door of the Kingdom of the Heavens against men; you yourselves do not enter, nor do you allow those to enter who are seeking to do so. 14 15“Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you scour sea and land in order to win one convert—and when he is gained, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves. 16“Alas for you, you blind guides, who say, “’Whoever swears by the Sanctuary it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the Sanctuary, is bound by the oath.’ 17“Blind fools!

Matthew,23,28,"The same is true of you: outwardly you seem to the human eye to be good and honest men, but, within, you are full of insincerity and disregard of God’s Law. 29“Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you repair the sepulchres of the Prophets and keep in order the tombs of the righteous, 30and your boast is, “’If we had lived in the time of our forefathers, we should not have been implicated with them in the murder of the Prophets.’ 31“So that you bear witness against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the Prophets."

Mark,3,31,"By this time His mother and His brothers arrive, and standing outside they send a message to Him"
Mark,3,32,"Now a crowd was sitting round Him; so they tell Him, “Your mother and your brothers"

Mark,4,10,"When He was alone, the Twelve and the others who were about Him requested Him to explain His figurative language. 11“To you,” He replied, “has been entrusted the secret truth concerning the Kingdom of God; but to those others outside your number all this is spoken in figurative language; 12that “’They may look and look but not see, and listen and listen but not understand, lest perchance they should return and be pardoned.’” The Parable of the Sower Explained (Matthew 13:18–23; Luke 8:11–15) 13“Do you all miss the meaning of this parable?” He added; “how then will you understand the rest of"

Mark,5,21,"When Jesus had re-crossed in the boat to the other side, a vast multitude came crowding to Him; and He was on the shore of the Lake, 22when there came one of the Wardens of the Synagogue—he was called Jair—who, on beholding Him, threw himself at His feet, 23and besought Him with many entreaties. “My little daughter,” he said, “is at the point of death: I pray you come and lay your hands"
Mark,5,24,"And Jesus went with him. And a dense crowd followed Him, and thronged Him on all sides."
Mark,5,25,"Now a woman who for twelve years had suffered from haemorrhage, 26and had undergone many different treatments under a number of doctors and had spent all she had without receiving benefit but on the contrary growing worse, 27heard of Jesus. And she came in the crowd behind Him and"

Mark,5,35,"While He is yet speaking, men come from the house to the Warden, and say, “Your daughter is dead:"
Mark,5,36,"But Jesus, overhearing the words, said to the Warden, “Do not be"

Mark,6,1,"Leaving that place He came into His own country, accompanied by His disciples."
Mark,6,2,"On the Sabbath He proceeded to teach in the synagogue; and many, as they heard Him, were astonished. “Where did he acquire all this?” they asked. “What is this wisdom that has been given to him? And what are these"

Mark,6,30,"When the Apostles had re-assembled round Jesus, they reported to Him all they had done and all"
Mark,6,31,"Then He said to them, “Come away, all of you, to a quiet place, and rest awhile.”"
Mark,6,32,Accordingly they sailed away in the boat to a solitary place apart.

Mark,6,35,"By this time it was late; so His disciples came to Him, and said, “This is a lonely place, and the hour is now late: 36send them away that they may go to the farms and villages near here and buy themselves something to eat.” 37“Give them food yourselves,” He replied. “Are we,” they asked, “to go and buy two hundred shillings’ worth of bread and give them food?” 38“How many loaves have you?” He inquired; “go and see.” So they found out,"
Mark,6,39,So He directed them to make all sit down in companies on the

Mark,6,45,"Immediately afterwards He made His disciples go on board the boat and cross over to Bethsaida,"
Mark,6,46,"He then bade the people farewell, and went away up the hill to pray."
Mark,6,47,"When evening was come, the boat was half way across the Lake, while he Himself was on shore"
Mark,6,48,But when He saw them distressed with rowing (for the wind was against them)
Mark,6,49,"They saw Him walking on the water, and thinking that it was a spirit they cried out; 50for they all saw Him and were terrified. He, however, immediately spoke to them. “There is no danger,” He said; “it is I; be not"
Mark,6,51,"Then He went up to them on board the boat, and the wind lulled; and they were beside"

Mark,7,1,"Then the Pharisees, with certain Scribes who had come from Jerusalem, came to Him in a body."
Mark,7,2,"They had noticed that some of His disciples were eating their food with ‘unclean’ (that is to say, unwashed) 3 4and when they come from market they will not eat without bathing first; and they have a good many other customs which they have received traditionally and cling to, such as the rinsing of cups"
Mark,7,5,"So the Pharisees and Scribes put the question to Him: “Why do your disciples transgress the traditions of the Elders, and eat their food with unclean hands?” 6“Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites,” He replied; “as it is written, “’This People honour Me with their lips, while their hearts are far away from Me:"
Mark,7,7,"But idle is their devotion while they lay down precepts which are mere human rules.’ 8“You neglect God’s Commandment: you hold fast to men’s traditions.” 9“Praiseworthy indeed!” He added, “to set at nought God’s Commandment in order to observe your"

Mark,7,11,"But *you* say, ‘If a man says to his father or mother, It is a Korban"
Mark,7,12,"And so you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or mother, 13thus nullifying God’s precept by your tradition which you have handed down. And many things of that kind you do.” What Defiles a Man (Matthew 15:10–20)"
Mark,7,14,"Then Jesus called the people to Him again. “Listen to me, all of you,” He said, “and understand."
Mark,7,15,There is nothing outside a man which entering him can make him unclean; but it is the things which come out of a man that make him unclean.” 16
Mark,7,17,"After He had left the crowd and gone indoors, His disciples began to ask Him about this figure of speech. 18“Have *you* also so little understanding?” He replied; “do you not understand that anything whatever that enters a man from outside cannot make him unclean, 19because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and passes away ejected from him?” By these words Jesus pronounced all kinds of food clean. 20“What comes out of a man,” He added, “that it is which makes him unclean."
Mark,7,21,"For from within, out of men’s hearts, their evil purposes proceed—fornication, theft, murder, adultery, 22covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, reviling, pride, reckless folly: 23all these wicked things come out from within and make a man unclean.” The Faith of the Gentile Woman (Matthew 15:21–28)"
Mark,7,24,Then He rose and left that place and went into the neighbourhood of Tyre and Sidon. Here He
Mark,7,25,"Forthwith a woman whose little daughter was possessed by a foul spirit heard of Him, and came and flung herself"
Mark,7,26,"She was a Gentile woman, a Syro-phoenician by nation: and again and again she begged Him to expel the demon from her daughter. 27“Let the children first eat all they want,” He said; “it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” 28“True, Sir,” she replied, “and yet the dogs under the table eat the children’s scraps.” 29“For those words of yours, go home,” He replied;"
Mark,7,30,"So she went home, and found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. The Deaf and Mute Man (Matthew 9:27–34)"
Mark,7,31,"Returning from the neighbourhood of Tyre, He came by way of Sidon to the Lake of Galilee, passing"
Mark,7,32,"Here they brought to Him a deaf man that stammered, on"

Mark,8,3,"If I were to send them home hungry, they would faint on the way, some of them having come a great distance.” 4“Where can we possibly get bread here in this remote place to satisfy such a crowd?” answered His disciples. 5“How many loaves have you?” He"

Mark,8,11,"The Pharisees followed Him and began to dispute with Him, asking Him for a sign in the sky, to make"
Mark,8,12,"Heaving a deep and troubled sigh, He said, “Why do the men of to-day ask for a sign?"
Mark,8,13,"So He left them, went on board again, and came away to the other side. The Leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod (Matthew 16:5–12; Luke 12:1–3)"
Mark,8,14,"Now they had forgotten to take bread, nor had they more than a single loaf with them in the boat; 15and when He admonished them, “See to it, be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod,” 16they explained His words to one another by saying, “We have no bread!”"
Mark,8,17,"He perceived what they were saying, and He said to them, “What is this discussion of yours about having no bread? Do you not yet see and understand? Are your minds so dull of comprehension?"
Mark,8,18,You have eyes! can you not see? You have ears! can you not hear? and have you no memory?
Mark,8,19,"When I broke up the five loaves for the 5,000 men, how many baskets did you carry away full of broken portions?” “Twelve,” they said. 20“And when the seven for the 4,000, how many hampers full of portions did you take away?” “Seven,” they answered. 21“Do you not yet understand?” He said. The Blind Man at Bethsaida"
Mark,8,22,And they came to Bethsaida. And a blind man was brought to Jesus and they entreated Him to touch

Mark,8,26,"So He sent him home, and added, “Do not even go into the village.” Peter’s Confession of Christ (Matthew 16:13–20; Luke 9:18–20; John 6:67–71)"
Mark,8,27,"From that place Jesus and His disciples went to the villages belonging to Caesarea Philippi. On the way He began to ask His disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” 28“John the Baptist,” they replied,"
Mark,8,29,"Then He asked them pointedly,"
Mark,8,30,And He strictly forbad them to tell this about Him to any one. Christ’s Passion Foretold (Matthew 16:21–23; Luke 9:21–22)
Mark,8,31,"And now for the first time He told them, “The Son of Man must endure much suffering, and be rejected by the Elders and the High Priests and the Scribes, and be put to death, and after two days"
Mark,8,32,This He told them plainly; whereupon Peter took Him and began to remonstrate with
Mark,8,33,"But turning round and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter. “Get behind me, Adversary,” He said, “for your thoughts are not God’s thoughts, but men’s.” Take Up Your Cross (Matthew 16:24–28; Luke 9:23–27)"

Mark,8,36,"Why, what does it benefit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?"
Mark,8,37,For what could a man give to buy back his life?
Mark,8,38,"Every one, however, who has been ashamed of me and of my teachings in this faithless and sinful age, of him the Son of Man also will be ashamed when He comes in His Father’s glory with the holy angels.”"
Mark,9,1,"He went on to say, “In solemn truth I tell you that some of those who are standing here will certainly not taste death till they have seen the Kingdom of God already come in power.”"

Are you able to drink out of the cup from which I am to drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized?” 39“We are able,” they replied. “Out of the cup,” said Jesus, “from which I am to drink you shall drink, and with the baptism with which I am to be baptized you shall be baptized; 40but as to sitting at my right hand or at my left, that is not mine to give: it will be for those for whom it is reserved.”"
Mark,10,41,"The other ten, hearing of it, were at first highly indignant with James and John."

The Sadducees and the Resurrection (Matthew 22:23–33; Luke 20:27–40)"
Mark,12,18,"Then came to Him a party of Sadducees, a sect which denies that there is any Resurrection; and they proceeded to question Him. 19“Rabbi,” they said, “Moses made it a law for us: ‘If a man’s brother should die and leave a wife, but no child, the man shall marry the widow and raise up a family for his"
Mark,12,20,"There were once seven brothers, the eldest of whom married a wife, but at his death left"

Mark,12,28,"Then one of the Scribes, who had heard them disputing and well knew that Jesus had given them an answer to the point, and a forcible one, came forward and asked Him, “Which is the chief of all the Commandments?” 29“The chief Commandment,” replied Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord; 30and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole mind, and thy whole strength.’ 31“The second is this: ‘Thou shalt love thy fellow man as thou"

Mark,12,34,"Perceiving that the Scribe had answered wisely Jesus said to him, “You are not far from the Kingdom of God.” No one from that time forward ventured to put any question to Him. Whose Son Is the Christ? (Matthew 22:41–46; Luke 20:41–44)"
Mark,12,35,"But, while teaching in the Temple, Jesus asked, “How is it the Scribes say that the Christ is a son of David?"
Mark,12,36,"David himself said, taught by the Holy Spirit, “’The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I have made thy foes a footstool under thy feet.’ 37“David himself calls Him ‘Lord:’ how then can He be his son?” And the mass of people found pleasure in listening to Jesus. Beware of the Scribes (Luke 20:45–47)"
Mark,12,38,"Moreover in the course of His teaching He said, “Be on your guard against the Scribes who like to walk about in long robes and to be bowed to in places of public resort, 39and to occupy the best seats in the synagogues and at dinner parties, 40and who swallow up the property of widows and then mask their wickedness by making long prayers: these men will receive far heavier punishment.” The Widow’s Offering (Luke 21:1–4)"
Mark,12,41,"Having taken a seat opposite the Treasury, He observed how the people were dropping money into"

Mark,12,43,"So He called His disciples to Him and said, “In solemn truth I tell you that this widow, poor as she is, has thrown in more than all the other contributors to the Treasury; 44for they have all contributed out of what they could well spare, but she out of her need has thrown in all she possessed—all she had to live on.”"
Mark,13,1,"As He was leaving the Temple, one of His disciples exclaimed, “Look, Rabbi, what wonderful stones! what wonderful buildings!” 2“You see all these great buildings?” Jesus replied; “not one stone will be left here upon another—not thrown down.”"

John,3,1,Now there was one of the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus—a ruler among the Jews.
John,3,2,"He came to Jesus by night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher from God; for no one can do these miracles which you are doing, unless God is with him. 3“In most solemn truth I tell you,” answered Jesus, “that unless a man is born anew he cannot see the Kingdom of God.” 4“How is it possible,” Nicodemus asked, “for a man to be born when he is old?

John,3,22,After this Jesus and His disciples went into Judaea; and there He made a stay in company with them
John,3,23,"And John too was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there were many pools of water there; and people came and received baptism. 24"
John,3,25,"As the result, a discussion having arisen on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purification, 26they came to John and reported to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan and to whom you bore testimony is now baptizing, and great numbers of people are resorting to him.” 27“A man cannot obtain anything,” replied John, “unless it has been granted to him from Heaven."

John,4,7,"Presently there came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus asked her to give Him some water; 8for His disciples were gone to the town to buy provisions. 9“How is it,” replied the woman, “that a Jew like you asks me, who am a woman and a Samaritan, for water?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) 10“If you had known God’s free gift,” replied Jesus, “and who it is that said to you, ‘Give me some water,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.” 11“Sir,” she said, “you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; so where can you get the living water from?"
John,4,12,"Are you greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank from it, as did also his sons and his cattle?” 13“Every one,” replied Jesus, “who drinks any of this water will be thirsty again; 14but whoever drinks any of the water that I shall give him will never, never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become a fountain within him of water springing up for the Life of the Ages.” 15“Sir,” said the woman, “give me that water, that I may never be thirsty, nor continually come all the way here to draw from the well.” 16“Go and call your husband,” said Jesus; “and come back.” 17“I have no husband,” she replied. “You rightly say that you have no husband,” said Jesus; 18“for you have had five husbands, and the man you have at present is not your husband.

John,6,17,"There they got on board a boat, and pushed off to cross the Lake to Capernaum. By this time it had become dark, and Jesus had not yet"
John,6,18,"The Lake also was getting rough, because a strong wind was blowing."
John,6,19,"When, however, they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the water and coming near"
John,6,20,"They were terrified; but He called to them. “It is I,” He said, “do not be afraid.”"
John,6,21,Then they were willing to take Him on board; and in a moment the boat reached the shore at the point to which they were going. Jesus the Bread of Life
John,6,22,"Next morning the crowd who were still standing about on the other side of the Lake found that there had been but one small boat there, and they had seen that Jesus did not go on board with His disciples,"
John,6,23,Yet a number of small boats came from Tiberias to the neighbourhood of the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
John,6,24,"When however the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they themselves also"
John,6,25,"So when they had crossed the Lake and had found Him, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?” 26“In most solemn truth I tell you,” replied Jesus, “that you are searching for me not because you have"
John,6,27,"Bestow your pains not on the food which perishes, but on the food that remains unto the Life of the Ages—that food which will be the Son of Man’s gift to you; for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal.” 28“What are we to do,” they asked, “in order to carry out the things that God requires?” 29“This,” replied Jesus, “is above all the thing that God requires—that you should be believers in Him whom He has sent.” 30“What miracle then,” they asked, “do you perform for us to see and become believers in you? What do you *do*?"
John,6,31,"Our forefathers ate the manna in the Desert, as it is written, ‘He gave them bread out of Heaven to eat’.” 32“In most solemn truth I tell you,” replied Jesus, “that Moses did not give you the bread out of"
John,6,33,"For God’s bread is that which comes down out of Heaven and gives Life to the world.” 34“Sir,” they said, “always give us that bread.” 35“I am the bread of Life,” replied Jesus; “he who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes"

John,6,40,"For this is my Father’s will, that every one who fixes his gaze on the Son of God and believes in Him should have the Life of the Ages, and I will raise him to life on the last day.”"
John,6,41,Now the Jews began to find fault about Him because of His claiming to be the bread which came
John,6,42,"They kept asking, “Is not this man Joseph’s son? Is he not Jesus, whose father and mother we know? What does he mean by now saying, ‘I have come down out of Heaven’?” 43“Do not thus find fault among yourselves,” replied Jesus; 44“no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; then I will raise him to life on"
John,6,45,"It stands written in the Prophets, ‘And they shall all of them be taught by God’. Every"

John,6,52,"This led to an angry debate among the Jews. “How can this man,” they argued, “give us his flesh to eat?” 53“In most solemn truth I tell you,” said Jesus, “that unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man"
John,6,54,He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has the Life

John,6,59,Jesus said all this in the synagogue while teaching at Capernaum.
John,6,60,"Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard it, said, “This is hard to accept. Who can listen to"
John,6,61,"But, knowing in Himself that His disciples were dissatisfied about it, Jesus asked them, 62“Does this seem incredible to you? What then if you were to see the Son of Man ascending"
John,6,63,It is the spirit which gives Life. The flesh confers no benefit whatever.
John,6,64,"But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were that did not believe, and who it was that"
John,6,65,"So He added, “That is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it be granted him by the Father.”"
John,6,66,"Thereupon many of His disciples left Him and went away, and no longer associated with Him. Peter’s Confession of Faith (Matthew 16:13–20; Mark 8:27–30; Luke 9:18–20)"

John,7,9,"Such was His answer, and He remained in Galilee."
John,7,10,"When however His brothers had gone up to the Festival, then He also went up, not openly, but as it"
John,7,11,"Meanwhile the Jews at the Festival were looking for Him and were inquiring, “Where"
John,7,12,"Among the mass of the people there was much muttered debate about Him. Some said, “He"
John,7,13,Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke out boldly about Him.
John,7,14,"But when the Festival was already half over, Jesus went up to the Temple and commenced teaching."
John,7,15,"The Jews were astonished. “How does this man know anything of books,” they said, “although he"

John,7,18,"The man whose teaching originates with himself aims at his own glory. He who aims at the glory of Him who sent him teaches the truth, and there is no deception in him."
John,7,19,"Did not Moses give you the Law? And yet not a man of you obeys the Law. Why do you want to kill me?” 20“You are possessed by a demon,” replied the crowd; “no one wants to kill you.” 21“One deed"

John,7,27,"And yet we know this man, and we know where he is from;"
John,7,28,"Jesus therefore, while teaching in the Temple, cried aloud, and said, “Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. And yet I have not come of my own accord; but there is One who has sent me, an Authority indeed,"

John,7,30,"On hearing this they wanted to arrest Him; yet not a hand was laid on Him, because His time had not yet"
John,7,31,"But from among the crowd a large number believed in Him. “When the Christ comes,” they said, “will He perform more miracles than this teacher has performed?”"

John,7,45,"Meanwhile the officers returned to the High Priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why have you not brought him?” 46“No mere man has ever spoken as this man speaks,” said the officers. 47“Are *you* deluded too?” replied the Pharisees; 48“has any one of the Rulers or of the Pharisees believed"
John,7,49,But this rabble who understand nothing about the Law are accursed!”
John,7,50,"Nicodemus interposed—he who had formerly gone to Jesus, being himself one of them. 51“Does our Law,” he asked, “judge a man without first hearing what he has to say and ascertaining what his conduct is?” 52“Do you also come from Galilee?” they asked in reply. “Search and see for yourself that no Prophet"

John,8,10,"Then, raising His head, Jesus said to her, “Where are they? Has no one condemned you?” 11“No one, Sir,” she replied. “And *I* do not condemn you either,” said Jesus; “go, and from this time do not sin any more.” Jesus the Light of the World (1 John 1:5–10)"
John,8,12,"Once more Jesus addressed them. “I am the Light of the world,” He said; “the man who follows me shall certainly not walk in the dark, but shall have the light of Life.” 13“You are giving testimony about yourself,” said the Pharisees; “your testimony is not true.” 14“Even if I am giving testimony about myself,” replied Jesus, “my testimony is true; for I know where I came from and where I am going,"

John,8,17,"In your own Law, too, it is written that the testimony of two men is true."

John,8,20,"These sayings He uttered in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple; yet no one arrested Him, because His time had not yet come."
John,8,21,"Again He said to them, “I am going away. Then you will try to find me, but you will die in your sins."
John,8,22,"The Jews began to ask one another, “Is he going to kill himself, do you think, that he says, ‘Where I am going, it is impossible for you to come’?” 23“You,” He continued, “are from below, I am from above: you are of this present world, I am not of"
John,8,24,"That is why I told you that you will die in your sins; for, unless you believe that I am He, that is what will happen.” 25“You—who are you?” they asked. “How is it that I am speaking to you at all?” replied Jesus. 26“Many things I have to speak and to judge concerning you. But He who sent me is true, and the"

John,8,29,And He who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone: for I do always what is pleasing to Him.” The Truth Will Set You Free (2 John 1:4–6)
John,8,30,"As He thus spoke, many became believers in Him."
John,8,31,"Jesus therefore said to those of the Jews who had now believed in Him, “As for you, if you hold fast to my teaching, then you are truly my disciples; 32and you shall know the Truth, and the Truth will make you free.” 33“We are descendants of Abraham,” they answered, “and have never at any time been in slavery to any one. What do those words of yours mean, ‘You shall become free’?” 34“In most solemn truth I tell you,” replied Jesus, “that every one who commits sin is the slave of sin."

John,8,40,"But, in fact, you are longing to kill me, a man who has spoken to"
John,8,41,"You are doing the deeds of your father.” “We,” they replied, “are not illegitimate children. We have one Father, namely God.” 42“If God were your Father,” said Jesus, “you would love me; for it is from God that I came and I am"
John,8,43,How is it you do not understand me when

It is because you are not God’s children.” Before Abraham Was Born, I Am 48“Are we not right,” answered the Jews, “in saying that you are a Samaritan and are possessed by a demon?” 49“I am not possessed by a demon,” replied Jesus. “On the contrary I honour my Father, and"

John,8,51,"In most solemn truth I tell you that if any one shall have obeyed my teaching he shall in no case ever see death.” 52“Now,” exclaimed the Jews, “we know that you are possessed by a demon. Abraham died, and so did the Prophets, and yet *you* say, ‘If any one shall have obeyed"
John,8,53,"Are you really greater than our forefather Abraham? For he died. And the prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?” 54“Were I to glorify myself,” answered Jesus, “I should have no real glory. There is One who glorifies me—namely"

John,8,56,"Abraham your forefather exulted in the hope of seeing my day: and he saw it, and was glad.” 57“You are not yet fifty years old,” cried the Jews, “and have you seen Abraham?” 58“In most solemn truth,” answered Jesus, “I tell you that before Abraham came into existence, I am.”"
John,8,59,"Thereupon they took up stones with which to stone Him, but He hid Himself and went away out of the Temple."
John,9,1,"As He passed by, He saw a man who had been blind from his birth."
John,9,2,"So His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned—this man or his parents—that he was born blind?” 3“Neither he nor his parents sinned,” answered Jesus, “but he was born blind in order that God’s mercy might be openly shown in"

John,9,6,"After thus speaking, He spat on the ground, and then, kneading the dust and spittle into clay, He smeared the clay over the man’s eyes and said to him, 7“Go and wash in the pool of Siloam”—the name means ‘Sent.’ So he went and"
John,9,8,"His neighbours, therefore, and the other people to whom he had been a familiar object because he was a beggar, began asking, “Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?” 9“Yes it is,” replied some of them. “No it is not,” said others, “but he is like him.” His own statement was, “I am the man.” 10“How then were your eyes opened?” they asked. 11“He whose name is Jesus,” he answered, “made clay and smeared my eyes with it, and then told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and obtained sight.” 12“Where is he?” they inquired, but the man did not know. The Pharisees Investigate the Healing"
John,9,13,They brought him to the Pharisees—the man who had been blind.
John,9,14,Now the day on which Jesus
John,9,15,"So the Pharisees renewed their questioning as to how he had obtained his sight. “He put clay on my eyes,” he replied, “and I washed,"
John,9,16,"This led some of the Pharisees to say, “That man has not come from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.” “How is it possible for a bad man to do such miracles?” argued others."
John,9,17,"And there was a division among them. So again they asked the once blind man, “What is your account of him?—for he opened your eyes.” “He is a Prophet,” he replied."
John,9,18,"The Jews, however, did not believe the statement concerning him—that he had been blind and had obtained his sight—until they called his parents and asked them, 19“Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How is it then that he can now see?” 20“We know,” replied the parents, “that this is our son and that he was born blind; 21but how it is that he can now see or who has opened his eyes we"
John,9,22,"Such was their answer, because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already settled among themselves that if any one should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be excluded from the synagogue."
John,9,23,"That was why his parents said, “He is of full age: ask him himself.”"
John,9,24,"A second time therefore they called the man who had been blind, and said, “Give God the praise: we know that that man is a sinner.” 25“Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know,” he replied; “one thing I know—that I was once blind and that now I can see.” 26“What did he do to you?” they asked; “how did he open your eyes?” 27“I have told you already,” he replied, “and you did not listen to me."
John,9,28,"Then they railed at him,"
John,9,29,"We know that God spoke to Moses; but as for this fellow we do not know where he comes from.” 30“Why, this is marvellous!” the"

John,9,35,"Jesus heard that they had done this. So having found him, He asked him, “Do you believe in the Son of God?” 36“Who is He, Sir?” replied the man. “Tell me, so that I may believe in Him.” 37“You have seen Him,” said Jesus; “and not only so: He is now speaking to you.” 38“I believe, Sir,” he said. And he threw himself at His feet. 39“I came into this world,” said Jesus, “to judge men, that those who do"
John,9,40,"These words were heard by those of the Pharisees who were present, and they asked Him, “Are *we* also blind?” 41“If you were blind,” answered Jesus, “you would have no sin; but as a matter of fact you boast that you see. So your sin remains!”"

John,10,6,"Jesus spoke to them in this figurative language, but they did not understand what He meant."
John,10,7,"Again therefore Jesus said to them, “In most solemn truth I tell you that I am the Door of the sheep."
John,10,8,All who have come before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep would not listen to them.
John,10,9,I am

John,10,12,The hired servant—one who is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep—no sooner sees the wolf coming
John,10,13,"For he is only a hired servant and cares nothing for the sheep. 14“I am the Good Shepherd. And I know my sheep and my sheep know me, 15just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I am laying down my"

John,10,17,For this reason
John,10,18,"No one is taking it away from me, but I myself am laying it down. I am authorized to lay it down, and I am authorized to receive it back again. This is the command I received from my Father.”"
John,10,19,Again there arose a division among the Jews because of these words.
John,10,20,"Many of them said, “He is"
John,10,21,"Others argued, “That is not the language of a demoniac: and can a demon open blind men’s eyes?” Jesus at the Feast of Dedication"
John,10,22,"The Dedication Festival came on in Jerusalem. It was winter, 23and Jesus was walking in the Temple in Solomon’s Portico, 24when the Jews gathered round Him and kept asking Him, “How long do you mean to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so plainly.” 25“I have told you,” answered Jesus, “and you do not believe. The deeds that I do in my Father’s name—they give testimony about"
John,10,26,"But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep."

John,10,28,"I give them the Life of the Ages, and they shall never, never perish,"
John,10,29,What my Father has given me is more precious than all
John,10,30,I and the Father are one.”
John,10,31,Again the Jews brought stones with which to stone Him.
John,10,32,"Jesus remonstrated with them. “Many good deeds,” He said, “have I shown you as coming from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?” 33“For no good deed,” the Jews replied, “are we going to stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, who are only a man, are making yourself out to be God.” 34“Does it not stand written"

John,10,41,"Large numbers of people also came to Him. Their report was, “John"
John,10,42,And many became believers in Him there.
John,11,1,"Now a certain man, named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill—Bethany being the village of Mary and"
John,11,3,"So the sisters sent to Him to say, “Master, he whom you hold dear is ill.”"
John,11,4,"Jesus received the message and said, “This illness is not to end in death, but is to promote the glory of God,"
John,11,5,"Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and"
John,11,6,"When, however, He heard that Lazarus was ill, He still remained two days in that same place."
John,11,7,"Then, after that, He said to the disciples, “Let us return to Judaea.” 8“Rabbi,” exclaimed the disciples, “the Jews have just been trying to stone you, and do you think of going back there again?” 9“Are there not twelve hours in the day?” replied Jesus. “If any one walks in the daytime, he does not stumble—"
John,11,10,"But if a man walks by night, he does stumble, because the"

John,11,17,On His arrival Jesus found that Lazarus had already been three days in the tomb.

John,11,22,"And even now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you.” 23“Your brother shall rise again,” replied Jesus. 24“I know,” said Martha, “that he will rise again at the resurrection, on the last day.” 25“I am the Resurrection and the Life,” said Jesus; “he who believes in me, even if he has died, he shall live; 26and every one who is living and is a believer in me shall never, never die. Do you believe this?” 27“Yes, Master,” she replied; “I thoroughly believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”"
John,11,28,"After saying this, she went and called her sister Mary privately, telling her, “The Rabbi is here and is"
John,11,29,"So she, on hearing that, rose up quickly to go to Him."
John,11,30,"Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him."
John,11,31,"So the Jews who were with Mary in the house sympathizing with her, when they saw that she had risen hastily and had gone out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep aloud"
John,11,32,"Mary then, when she came to Jesus and saw Him, fell at His feet and exclaimed, “Master, if"
John,11,33,"Seeing her weeping aloud, and the Jews in like manner weeping who had come with her, Jesus, curbing the strong emotion of His spirit, 34though deeply troubled, asked them, “Where have you laid him?” “Master, come and see,” was"
John,11,35,"Jesus wept. 36“See how dear he held him,” said the Jews."
John,11,37,"But others of them asked, “Was this man who opened the blind man’s eyes unable to prevent this man from dying?” Jesus Raises Lazarus (Acts 9:36–43)"
John,11,38,"Jesus, however, again restraining His strong feeling, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone had been laid against the mouth of it. 39“Take away the stone,” said Jesus. Martha, the sister of the dead man, exclaimed, “Master, by this time there is a foul smell; for it is three days since he died.” 40“Did I not promise you,” replied Jesus,"
John,11,41,So they removed the stone. Then Jesus lifted

John,11,44,"The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped in cloths, and his face wrapped round with a towel. “Untie him,” said Jesus, “and let him go free.” The Plot to Kill Jesus (Matthew 26:1–5; Mark 14:1–2; Luke 22:1–2)"
John,11,45,Thereupon a considerable number of the Jews—namely those who had come to Mary and had witnessed His deeds—became believers in Him; 46though some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them what He had done.
John,11,47,Therefore the High Priests and the Pharisees held a meeting of the Sanhedrin. “What steps are we

John,11,50,You do not reflect that it is to your interest that one man should die for the people
John,11,51,"It was not as a mere man that he thus spoke. But being High Priest that year he was inspired to declare that Jesus was to die for the nation, 52and not for the nation"
John,11,53,So from that day forward they planned and schemed in order to put Him to death.
John,11,54,"Therefore Jesus no longer went about openly among the Jews, but He left that neighbourhood and went into the district near the Desert, to a town called Ephraim, and remained there with the disciples."
John,11,55,"The Jewish Passover was coming near, and many from that district went up to Jerusalem before the"

John,11,57,"Now the High Priests and the Pharisees had issued orders that if any one knew where He was, he should give information, so that they might arrest Him."

John,12,2,"So they gave a dinner there in honour of Jesus, at which Martha waited at table,"

John,12,4,"Then said Judas (the Iscariot, one of the Twelve—the one who afterwards betrayed Jesus) 5“Why was not that perfume sold for 300"

John,12,12,"The next day a great crowd of those who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 13took branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, shouting as they went, “God save him! Blessings on him who comes in the name of the Lord—even on the King of Israel!”"
John,12,14,"And Jesus, having procured a young ass, sat upon it, just as the Scripture says, 15“Fear not, Daughter"
John,12,16,"The meaning of this His disciples did not understand at the time; but after Jesus was glorified they recollected that this was written about Him,"
John,12,17,"The large number of people, however, who had been present when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and brought him back to life, related what they had witnessed."
John,12,18,"This was also why the crowd came to meet Him, because they had heard of His having performed"

John,12,33,He said this to indicate the kind of death He would die.
John,12,34,"The crowd answered Him, “We have heard out of the Law that the Christ remains for ever. In what sense do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is that Son of Man?” 35“Yet a little while,” He replied, “the light is among you. Be faithful to the light that you have, for fear darkness should overtake you; for a man who walks in the"

John,13,5,"Then He poured water into a basin, and proceeded to wash the feet of the disciples and to wipe them"
John,13,6,"When He came to Simon Peter, Peter objected. “Master,” he said, “are *you* going to wash my feet?” 7“What I am doing,” answered Jesus, “for the present you do not know, but afterwards you shall know.” 8“Never, while the world lasts,” said Peter, “shall you wash my feet.” “If I do not wash you,” replied Jesus, “you have no share with me.” 9“Master,” said Peter, “wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.” 10“Any one who has lately bathed,” said Jesus, “does not need to wash more than his feet, but is clean all over. And you my disciples are"
John,13,11,"For He knew who was betraying Him, and that was why He said, “You are not all of you clean.”"

John,18,12,"So the battalion and their tribune and the Jewish police closed in, and took Jesus and bound Him."
John,18,13,They then brought Him to Annas first; for Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was High Priest that year. 14 Peter’s First Denial (Matthew 26:69–70; Mark 14:66–68; Luke 22:54–57)

John,18,29,"Accordingly Pilate came out to them and inquired, “What accusation have you to bring against this man?” 30“If the man were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed him over to you.” 31“Take him yourselves,” said Pilate, “and judge him by your Law.” “We have no"
John,18,32,They said this that the words might be fulfilled in which Jesus predicted the kind of death He was to die.
John,18,33,"Re-entering the Praetorium, therefore, Pilate called Jesus and asked Him, “Are *you* the King of the Jews?” 34“Do you say this of yourself, or have others told it you about me?” replied Jesus. 35“Am I a Jew?” exclaimed Pilate; “it is your own nation and the High Priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?” 36“My kingdom,” replied Jesus, “does not belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world, my subjects would have resolutely fought to save me from being delivered up to the Jews. But, as a matter of fact, my kingdom has not this origin.” 37“So then *you* are a king!” rejoined Pilate. “Yes,” said Jesus, “you say truly that I am a king. For this purpose I was born, and for this purpose I have come into the world—to give testimony for the truth. Every one who is a friend of the truth listens to my voice.” 38“What is truth?” said Pilate. But no sooner had he spoken the words"

To the cross!” “Take him yourselves and crucify him,” said Pilate; “for I, at any rate, find no crime in him.” 7“We,” replied the Jews, “have a Law, and in accordance with that Law he ought to die, for having claimed to be the Son of God.”"
John,19,8,"More alarmed than ever, Pilate no sooner heard these words than he re-entered the Praetorium and began to question Jesus. 9“What is your origin?” he asked. But Jesus gave him no answer. 10“Do you refuse to speak even to me?” asked Pilate; “do you not know that I have it in my power either to release you or to crucify you?” 11“You would have had no power whatever over me,” replied Jesus, “had it not been granted you from above. On that account he who has delivered me up to you is more"
John,19,12,"Upon receiving this answer, Pilate was for releasing Him. But the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar’s. Every one who sets himself up as king declares himself a rebel against Caesar.”"

Romans,2,17,"And since you claim the name of Jew, and find rest and satisfaction in the Law, and make your boast in God, 18and know the supreme will, and can test things that differ—being a man who receives instruction from the Law— 19and have persuaded yourself that, as for you, you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, 20a schoolmaster for the dull and ignorant, a teacher of the young, because in the Law you possess an outline of real knowledge and an outline of the truth: 21you then who teach your fellow man, do you refuse to teach yourself? You who cry out against stealing,"
Romans,2,22,"You who forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You who loathe idols, do"
Romans,2,23,"You who make your boast in the Law, do you offend against its commands"
Romans,2,24,"For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentile nations because of you, as Holy Writ declares."
Romans,2,25,"Circumcision does indeed profit, if you obey the Law; but if you are a Law-breaker, the fact that you"
Romans,2,26,"In the same way if an uncircumcised man pays attention to the just requirements of the Law, shall not his lack of circumcision be overlooked, and, 27although he is a Gentile by birth, if he scrupulously obeys the Law, shall he not sit in judgement upon you who,"
Romans,2,28,"For the true Jew is not the man who is simply a Jew outwardly, and true circumcision is not that which is outward and"
Romans,2,29,"But the true Jew is one inwardly, and true circumcision is heart-circumcision—not literal, but spiritual; and such people receive praise not from men, but from God."
Romans,3,1,"What special privilege, then, has a Jew? Or what benefit is to be derived from circumcision?"
Romans,3,2,"The privilege is great from every point of view. First of all, because the Jews were entrusted with God’s"
Romans,3,3,For what if some Jews have proved unfaithful? Shall their faithlessness render God’s faithfulness worthless?
Romans,3,4,"No, indeed; let us hold God to be true, though every man should prove to be false. As it stands written, “That Thou mayest be shown to be just in the sentence Thou pronouncest, and gain Thy cause when Thou contendest.”"
Romans,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness sets God’s righteousness in a clearer light, what shall we say? (Is God"
Romans,3,6,No indeed; for in that
Romans,3,7,"If, for instance, a falsehood of mine has made God’s truthfulness more conspicuous, redounding to His glory, why am I judged all the same as a sinner?"
Romans,3,8,"And why should we not say—for so they wickedly misrepresent us, and so some charge us with arguing—”Let us do evil that good may come”? The condemnation of those who would so argue is just. There Is No One Righteous (Psalm 14:1–7; Psalm 53:1–6; Isaiah 59:1–17)"
Romans,3,9,What then? Are we Jews more highly estimated than they? Not in the least; for we have already charged all Jews and Gentiles alike with being in thraldom to sin.
Romans,3,10,"Thus it stands written, “There is not one righteous man."
Romans,3,11,"There is not one who is really wise, nor one who is a diligent seeker after God."
Romans,3,12,"All have turned aside from the right path; they have every one of them become corrupt. There is no one who does what is right—no, not so much as one.” 13“Their throats resemble an opened grave; with their tongues they have been talking deceitfully.” “The venom of vipers lies hidden behind their lips.” 14“Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.” 15“Their feet move swiftly to shed blood."
Romans,3,16,Ruin and misery mark their path; 17and the way to peace they have not known.” 18“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
Romans,3,19,"But it cannot be denied that all that the Law says is addressed to those who are living under the Law, in order that every mouth may be stopped, and that the whole world may await sentence from"
Romans,3,20,For on the ground of obedience to Law no man living will be declared righteous before Him. Law simply brings a sure knowledge of sin. Righteousness through Faith in Christ (Philippians 3:1–11)
Romans,3,21,"But now a righteousness coming from God has been brought to light apart from any Law, both Law and Prophets bearing witness to it— 22a righteousness coming from God, which depends on faith in Jesus Christ and extends to all who believe. No distinction is made; 23for all alike have sinned, and all consciously come short of the glory of God, 24gaining acquittal from guilt by His free unpurchased"
Romans,3,25,"He it is whom God put forward as a Mercy-seat, rendered efficacious through faith in His blood, in order to demonstrate His righteousness— because of the passing over, in God’s forbearance, of the sins previously committed— 26with a view to demonstrating, at the present time, His righteousness, that He may be shown to be righteous Himself, and the giver of righteousness to those who believe in Jesus."
Romans,3,27,Where then is there room for your boasting? It is for ever shut out. On what principle? On the ground
Romans,3,28,For we maintain that it is as the result of faith that a man
Romans,3,29,"Is God simply the God of the Jews, and not of the Gentiles also? He is certainly the God of the Gentiles also, 30unless you can deny that it is one and the same God who will pronounce the circumcised to be acquitted on the ground of faith, and the uncircumcised to be acquitted through the same faith."
Romans,3,31,"Do we then by means of this faith abolish the Law? No, indeed; we give the Law a firmer footing."
Romans,4,1,"What then shall we say that Abraham, our earthly forefather, has gained?"
Romans,4,2,"For if he was held to be righteous on the ground of his actions, he has something to boast of; but not in the presence of God."
Romans,4,3,"For what says the Scripture? “And Abraham believed God, and this was placed to his credit as"
Romans,4,4,"But in the case of a man who works, pay is not reckoned a favour but a debt; 5whereas in the case of a man who pleads no actions of his own, but simply believes in Him who declares the"
Romans,4,6,"In this way David also tells of the blessedness of the man to whose credit God places righteousness, apart from his actions. 7“Blessed,” he says, “are those whose iniquities have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered over."
Romans,4,8,Blessed is the man of whose sin the Lord will not take account.”
Romans,4,9,"This declaration of blessedness, then, does it come simply to the circumcised, or to the uncircumcised"
Romans,4,10,"What then were the circumstances under which this took place? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before?"
Romans,4,11,"Before, not after. And he received circumcision as a sign, a mark attesting the reality of the faith- righteousness which was his while still uncircumcised, that he might be the forefather of all those who believe even though they are uncircumcised—in order that this righteousness might be placed to their credit; 12and the forefather of the circumcised, namely of those who not merely are circumcised, but also walk in the steps of the faith which our forefather Abraham had while he was as yet uncircumcised. Abraham Receives the Promise (Genesis 15:8–21)"
Romans,4,13,"Again, the promise that he should inherit the world did not come to Abraham or his posterity"
Romans,4,14,"For if it is the righteous through Law who are heirs,"
Romans,4,15,"For the Law inflicts punishment; but where no Law exists, there can be no violation of Law."
Romans,4,16,"All depends on faith, and for this reason—that acceptance with God might be an act of pure grace, 17so that the promise should be made sure to all Abraham’s true descendants; not merely to those who are righteous through the Law, but to those who are righteous through a faith like that of Abraham. Thus in the sight of God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and makes reference to things that do not exist, as though they did, Abraham is the forefather of all of us. As it is written, “I have"
Romans,4,18,"Under utterly hopeless circumstances he hopefully believed, so that he might become the forefather of many nations, in agreement with the"
Romans,4,19,"And, without growing weak in faith, he could contemplate his own vital powers which had now decayed—for he was nearly 100 years old—and"
Romans,4,20,"Nor did he in unbelief stagger at God’s promise, but became mighty in faith, giving glory to God, 21and being absolutely certain that whatever promise He is bound by He is able"
Romans,4,22,For this reason also his faith was placed to his credit as righteousness.
Romans,4,23,"Nor was the fact of its being placed to his credit put on record for his sake only; 24it was for our sakes too. Faith, before long, will be placed to the credit of us also who are believers in Him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead, 25who was surrendered to death because of the offences we had committed, and was raised to life because of the acquittal secured for us."
Romans,5,1,"Standing then acquitted as the result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2through whom also, as the result of faith, we have obtained an introduction into that state of"
Romans,5,3,"And not only so: we also exult in our sufferings, knowing as we do, that suffering produces fortitude; 4fortitude, ripeness of character; and ripeness of character, hope; 5and that this hope never disappoints, because God’s love for us floods our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. Christ’s Sacrifice for the Ungodly (John 3:1–21)"
Romans,5,6,"For already, while we were still helpless, Christ at the right moment died for the ungodly."
Romans,5,7,"Why, it is scarcely conceivable that any one would die for a simply just man, although for a good and lovable"
Romans,5,8,But God gives
Romans,5,9,"If therefore we have now been pronounced free from guilt through His blood, much more shall we be delivered from God’s anger"
Romans,5,10,"For if while we were hostile to God we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son, it is still more certain that now that we are reconciled, we shall obtain salvation through Christ’s"
Romans,5,11,"And not only so, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now obtained that reconciliation. Death in Adam, Life in Christ (Genesis 3:1–7)"
Romans,5,12,"What follows? This comparison. Through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin death,"
Romans,5,13,For prior to the Law sin was already in
Romans,5,14,"Yet Death reigned as king from Adam to Moses even over those who had not sinned, as Adam did, against Law. And in Adam we have a type of Him whose coming was still future."
Romans,5,15,"But God’s free gift immeasurably outweighs the transgression. For if through the transgression of the one individual the mass of mankind have died, infinitely greater is the generosity with which God’s grace, and the gift given in His grace which found expression in the one man Jesus Christ, have been"
Romans,5,16,"And it is not with the gift as it was with the results of one individual’s sin; for the judgement which one individual provoked resulted in condemnation, whereas"
Romans,5,17,"For if, through the transgression of the one individual, Death made use of the one individual to seize the sovereignty, all the more shall those who receive God’s overflowing grace and gift of righteousness reign as kings in Life through the one individual, Jesus Christ."
Romans,5,18,"It follows then that just as the result of a single transgression is a condemnation which extends to the whole race, so also the result of a single decree of righteousness is a life-giving acquittal which"
Romans,5,19,"For as through the disobedience of the one individual the mass of mankind were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the mass of mankind will be"
Romans,5,20,"Now Law was brought in later on, so that transgression might increase. But where sin increased, grace has overflowed; 21in order that as sin has exercised kingly sway in inflicting death, so grace, too, may exercise kingly sway in bestowing a righteousness which results in the Life of the Ages through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans,6,1,"To what conclusion, then, shall we come? Are we to persist in sinning in order that the grace extended"
Romans,6,2,"No, indeed; how shall we who have died to sin, live in it any longer?"
Romans,6,3,And do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?
Romans,6,4,"Well, then, we by our baptism were buried with Him in death, in order that, just as Christ was raised"
Romans,6,5,"For since we have become one with Him by sharing in His death, we shall also be one with Him by sharing"
Romans,6,6,"This we know—that our old self was nailed to the cross with Him, in order that our sinful nature might be deprived of its power, so that we should no longer be the slaves of sin; 7for he who has paid the penalty of death stands absolved from his sin."
Romans,6,8,"But, seeing that we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him; 9because we"
Romans,6,10,"Death has no longer any power over Him. For by the death which He died He became, once for all, dead in relation to sin; but by the"
Romans,6,11,"In the same way you also must regard yourselves as dead in relation to sin, but as alive in relation to God, because you are in Christ Jesus."
Romans,6,12,"Let not Sin therefore reign as king in your mortal bodies, causing you to be in subjection to their cravings; 13and no longer lend your faculties as unrighteous weapons for Sin to use. On the contrary surrender your very selves to God as living men who have risen from the dead, and surrender your"

Romans,6,15,"Are we therefore to sin because we are no longer under the authority of Law, but under grace? No,"
Romans,6,16,"Do you not know that if you surrender yourselves as bondservants to obey any one, you become the bondservants of him whom you obey, whether the bondservants of Sin (with death as the"

Romans,6,18,"You were set free from the tyranny of Sin, and became the bondservants of Righteousness— 19your human infirmity leads me to employ these familiar figures—and just as you once surrendered your faculties into bondage to Impurity and ever-increasing disregard of Law, so you must now surrender them into bondage to Righteousness ever advancing towards perfect holiness."
Romans,6,20,"For when you were the bondservants of sin, you were under no sort of subjection to Righteousness."
Romans,6,21,"At that time, then, what benefit did you get from conduct which you now regard with shame? Why,"
Romans,6,22,"But now that you have been set free from the tyranny of Sin, and have become the bondservants of God, you have your reward in being made holy, and you have the"
Romans,6,23,For the wages paid by Sin are death; but God’s free gift is the Life of the Ages bestowed upon us in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Romans,7,2,"A wife, for instance, whose husband is living is bound to him"
Romans,7,3,"This accounts for the fact that if during her husband’s life she lives with another man, she will be stigmatized as an adulteress; but that if her husband is dead she is no longer under the old prohibition, and even though she marries again, she is not an adulteress."

No, indeed, but sin did; so that through its bringing about death by means of what was good, it might be seen in its true light as sin, in order that by means of the Commandment the unspeakable sinfulness of sin might be plainly shown."
Romans,7,14,"For we know that the Law is a spiritual thing; but I am unspiritual—the slave, bought and sold, of"

Romans,8,26,"In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness; for we do not know what prayers to offer nor in what way to offer them. But the Spirit Himself pleads for us in yearnings that can find no words, 27and the Searcher of hearts knows what the Spirit’s meaning is, because His intercessions for God’s people are in harmony with God’s will.

Romans,8,36,"As it stands written in the Scripture, “For Thy sake they are, all day long, trying to kill us. We have been looked upon as sheep destined for slaughter.”"
Romans,8,37,Yet amid all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who has loved us.

Romans,11,2,"God has not cast off His People whom He knew beforehand. Or are you ignorant of what Scripture says in speaking of Elijah—how he pleaded with God against Israel, saying, 3“Lord, they have put Thy Prophets to death, and have overthrown Thy altars; and, now"
Romans,11,4,But what did God say to him in reply? “I have

Romans,11,7,"How then does the matter stand? It stands thus. That which Israel are in earnest pursuit of, they have not obtained; but God’s chosen servants have obtained it, and the rest have become hardened."
Romans,11,8,"And so Scripture says, “God has given them a spirit of drowsiness—eyes to see nothing with and ears to hear nothing with—even until now.”"
Romans,11,9,"And David says, “Let their very food become a snare and a trap to them, a stumbling-block and a retribution."

Romans,11,11,"I ask, however, “Have they stumbled so as to be finally ruined?” No, indeed; but by their lapse salvation has come to the Gentiles in order to arouse the jealousy of the descendants of Israel; 12and if their lapse is the enriching of the world, and their overthrow the enriching of the Gentiles, will not"

Romans,11,16,"Now if the firstfruits of the dough are holy, so also is the whole mass; and if the root of a tree is holy, so also are the branches."
Romans,11,17,"And if some of the branches have been pruned away, and you, although you were but a wild olive, have been grafted in among them and have become a sharer with others in the rich sap of the root of the olive tree, 18beware of glorying over the natural branches. Or if you are so glorying, do not forget that it is not you who uphold the root: the root upholds you. 19“Branches have been lopped off,” you"

Romans,11,23,"Moreover, if they turn from their unbelief, they too will be grafted in. For God is powerful enough to graft them in again; 24and if you were cut from that which by nature is a wild olive and contrary to nature were grafted into the good olive tree, how much more certainly will these natural branches be grafted on their own olive tree? All Israel Will Be Saved"
Romans,11,25,"For there is a truth, brethren, not revealed hitherto, of which I do not wish to leave you in ignorance, for fear you should attribute superior wisdom to yourselves—the truth, I mean, that partial blindness has fallen upon Israel until the great mass of the Gentiles have come in; 26and so all Israel will be saved. As is declared in Scripture, “From Mount Zion a Deliverer will come: He will remove all ungodliness from Jacob; 27and this shall be My Covenant with them; when I have taken away their sins.”"
Romans,11,28,"In relation to the Good News, the Jews are God’s enemies for your sakes; but in relation to God’s"

Romans,14,10,"But you, why do you find fault with your brother? Or you, why do you look down upon your brother? We shall all stand before God to be judged; 11for it is written, “’As I live,’ says the Lord, ‘to Me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall make confession to God.’”"
Romans,14,12,So we see that every one of us will give account of himself to God. The Law of Love (Ezekiel 14:1–11; 1 Corinthians 8:1–13)
Romans,14,13,"Therefore let us no longer judge one another; but, instead of that, you should come to this judgement—that we must not put a stumbling-block in our brother’s path, nor anything to trip him up."

Romans,15,7,"Habitually therefore give one another a friendly reception, just as Christ also has received you, and thus promote the glory of God."
Romans,15,8,"My meaning is that Christ has become a servant to the people of Israel in vindication of God’s truthfulness—in showing how sure are the promises made to our forefathers— 9and that the Gentiles also have glorified God in acknowledgment of His mercy. So it is written, “For this reason I will praise Thee among the Gentiles, and sing psalms in honour of Thy name.”"
Romans,15,10,"And again the Psalmist says, “Be glad, ye Gentiles, in company with His People.”"
Romans,15,11,"And again, “Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and let all the people extol Him.”"

Romans,15,15,"But I write to you the more boldly—partly as reminding you of what you already know—because of the authority graciously entrusted to me by God, 16that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles, doing priestly duties in connexion with God’s Good News so that the sacrifice—namely the Gentiles—may be acceptable to Him, being"
Romans,15,17,I can therefore glory in Christ Jesus concerning the work for God in which I am engaged.
Romans,15,18,"For I will not presume to mention any of the results that Christ has brought about by other agency than mine in securing the obedience of the Gentiles by word or deed, 19with power manifested in signs and marvels, and through the power of the Holy Spirit. But—to speak simply of my own labours— beginning in Jerusalem and the outlying districts, I have proclaimed without reserve, even as far as Illyricum, the Good News of the Christ; 20making it my ambition, however, not to tell the Good News where Christ’s name was already known, for fear I should be building on another man’s foundation."
Romans,15,21,"But, as Scripture says, “Those shall see, to whom no report about Him has hitherto come, and those who until now have not heard shall understand.”"

Romans,15,30,"But I entreat you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love which His Spirit inspires, to help me by wrestling in prayer to God on my behalf, 31asking that I may escape unhurt from those in Judaea who are disobedient, and that the service which I am going to Jerusalem to render may be well received by the Church there, 32in order that if God be willing I may come to you"

1 Corinthians,4,6,"In writing this much, brethren, with special reference to Apollos and myself, I have done so for your sakes, in order to teach you by our example what those words mean, which say, “Nothing beyond what is written!”—so that you may cease to take sides in boastful rivalry, for one teacher against another."
1 Corinthians,4,7,"Why, who gives you your superiority, my brother? Or what have you that you did not receive? And if you really did receive it, why boast as if this were not so?"

1 Corinthians,5,9,"I wrote to you in that letter that you were not to associate with fornicators; 10not that in this world you are to keep wholly aloof from such as they, any more than from people who are avaricious and greedy of gain, or from worshippers of idols. For that would mean that you would be compelled to go"

1 Corinthians,6,15,Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them the members of a prostitute?

1 Corinthians,7,6,"Thus much in the way of concession, not of command."
1 Corinthians,7,7,Yet I would that everybody lived as I do; but each of us has his own special gift from God—one in one direction and one in another.
1 Corinthians,7,8,"But I tell the unmarried, and women who are widows, that it is well for them to remain as I am."
1 Corinthians,7,9,"If, however, they cannot maintain self-control, by all means let them marry; for marriage is better than the fever of passion."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"But to those already married my instructions are—yet not mine, but the Lord’s—that a wife is not to leave her husband; 11or if she has already left him, let her either remain as she is or be reconciled to him; and that a husband is not to send away his wife."

For the world as it now exists is passing away."
1 Corinthians,7,32,And I would have you free from worldly anxiety. An unmarried man concerns himself with the Lord’s business—how he shall please the Lord; 33but a married man concerns himself with the business of

1 Corinthians,7,38,"So that he who gives his daughter in marriage does well, and yet he who does not give her in marriage will do better."
1 Corinthians,7,39,"A woman is bound to her husband during the whole period that he lives; but if her husband dies,"

1 Corinthians,8,1,"Now as to things which have been sacrificed to idols. This is a subject which we already understand— because we all have knowledge of it. Knowledge, however, tends to make people conceited; it is love"
1 Corinthians,8,2,"If any one imagines that he already possesses any true knowledge, he has as yet attained to no knowledge of the kind to which he ought to have attained; 3but if any one loves God, that man is known by God."

1 Corinthians,13,12,"For the present we see things as if in a mirror, and are puzzled; but then we shall see them face to face. For the present the knowledge I gain is imperfect;"
1 Corinthians,13,13,"And so there remain Faith, Hope, Love—these three; and of these the greatest is Love."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Be eager in your pursuit of this Love, and be earnestly ambitious for spiritual gifts, but let it be chiefly"

1 Corinthians,14,6,"But, brethren, as things are, if I come to you speaking in ‘tongues,’ what benefit shall I confer on you, if the utterance is neither in the form of a revelation nor of additional knowledge nor of prophecy nor"

1 Corinthians,14,12,"Therefore, seeing that you are ambitious for spiritual gifts, seek to excel in them so as to benefit the Church."
1 Corinthians,14,13,Therefore let a man who has the gift of tongues pray for the power of interpreting them.
1 Corinthians,14,14,For if I

1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the Law it stands written, “’By men of unknown tongues and by the lips of an unknown nation will I speak to this People,"

1 Corinthians,14,24,"If, on the other hand, every one is prophesying and an unbeliever or an ungifted man comes in, he is convicted by all and closely examined by all, 25and the hidden evils of his heart are brought to light. And, as the result, he will fall on his face and worship God, and will report to others that of a truth God is among you. Orderly Worship"

1 Corinthians,14,34,"Let married women be silent in the Churches, for they are not permitted to speak. They must be content with a subordinate place, as the Law also says; 35and if they wish to ask questions, they should ask their own husbands at home. For it is disgraceful for a married woman to speak at a Church"

1 Corinthians,15,1,"But let me recall to you, brethren, the Good News which I brought you, which you accepted, and on which you are standing, 2through which also you are obtaining salvation, if you bear in mind the words in which I proclaimed it—unless indeed your faith has been unreal from the very first."

1 Corinthians,15,15,"Nay more, we are actually being discovered to be bearing false witness about God, because we have testified that God raised Christ to life, whom He did"
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if none of the dead are raised to life, then Christ has not risen; 17and if Christ has not risen, your faith is a vain thing—you are still in your sins."
1 Corinthians,15,18,It follows also that those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.

1 Corinthians,15,25,For He must continue King until He shall have put all His enemies under His feet.
1 Corinthians,15,26,"The last enemy that is to be overthrown is Death; 27for He will have put all things in subjection under His feet. And when He shall have declared that “All things are in subjection,” it will be with the manifest exception"

1 Corinthians,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars; for star differs from star in glory."
1 Corinthians,15,42,"It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in a state of decay, it is raised free from decay; 43it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 44an animal body is sown, a spiritual body is raised. As surely as there is an animal body, so"
1 Corinthians,15,45,"In the same way also it is written, “The first man Adam became a living"
1 Corinthians,15,46,"Nevertheless, it is not what is spiritual that came first,"

2 Corinthians,1,12,"For the reason for our boasting is this—the testimony of our own conscience that it was in holiness and with pure motives before God, and in reliance not on worldly wisdom but on the gracious help of"
2 Corinthians,1,13,"For we are writing to you nothing different from what we have written before, or from what indeed you already recognize as truth and will, I trust, recognize as such to the very end; 14just as some few of you have recognized us as your reason for boasting, even as you will be ours, on the day of Jesus our Lord."
2 Corinthians,1,15,"It was because I entertained this confidence that I intended to visit you before going elsewhere—so that you might receive a twofold proof of God’s favour— 16and to pass by way of Corinth into Macedonia. Then my plan was to return from Macedonia to you, and be helped forward by you to"

2 Corinthians,2,12,"Now when I came into the Troad to spread there the Good News about the Christ, even though in the Lord’s providence a door stood open before me, 13yet, obtaining no relief for my spirit because I did not find our brother Titus, I bade them farewell and went on into Macedonia."
2 Corinthians,2,14,"But to God be the thanks who in Christ ever heads our triumphal procession, and by our hands waves"
2 Corinthians,2,15,"For we are a fragrance of Christ grateful to God in those whom He is saving and in those who are perishing; 16to the last-named an odor of death predictive of death, and to the others an odor of life predictive of life. And for such service as"
2 Corinthians,2,17,"We are; for, unlike most teachers, we are not fraudulent hucksters of God’s Message; but with transparent motives, as commissioned by God, in God’s presence and in communion with Christ, so we speak."
2 Corinthians,3,1,"Do you say that this is self-recommendation once more? Or do we need, as some do, letters of"
2 Corinthians,3,2,Our letter of recommendation is yourselves—a letter written on

2 Corinthians,3,4,"Such is the confidence which we have through Christ in the presence of God; 5not that of ourselves we are competent to decide anything by our own reasonings, but our competency comes from God."
2 Corinthians,3,6,"It is He also who has made us competent to serve Him in connexion with a new Covenant, which is not a written code but a Spirit; for the written code inflicts death, but the Spirit gives Life. The Glory of the New Covenant (Exodus 34:10–35)"
2 Corinthians,3,7,"If, however, the service that proclaims death—its code being engraved in writing upon stones—came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily on the face of Moses because of the brightness of his face—a vanishing brightness; 8will not the service of the Spirit be far more glorious?"
2 Corinthians,3,9,"For if the service which pronounces doom had glory, far more glorious still is the service which tells"
2 Corinthians,3,10,"For, in fact, that which was once resplendent in glory has no glory at all in this"
2 Corinthians,3,11,"For if that which was to be abolished came with glory, much more is that which is permanent arrayed in glory."
2 Corinthians,3,12,"Therefore, cherishing a hope like this, we speak without reserve, and we do not imitate Moses, 13who used to throw a veil over his face to hide from the gaze of the children of Israel the passing away of"
2 Corinthians,3,14,"Nay, their minds were made dull; for to this very day during the reading of the book of the ancient Covenant, the same veil remains unlifted, because it is only in Christ that it is"
2 Corinthians,3,15,"Yes, to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their hearts."

2 Corinthians,3,18,"And all of us, with unveiled faces, reflecting like bright mirrors the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same likeness, from one degree of radiant holiness to another, even as derived from the Lord the Spirit."
2 Corinthians,4,1,"Therefore, being engaged in this service and being mindful of the mercy which has been shown us,"
2 Corinthians,4,2,"Nay, we have renounced the secrecy which marks a feeling of shame. We practice no cunning tricks, nor do we adulterate God’s Message. But by a full clear statement of the truth we"

2 Corinthians,4,6,"For God who said, “Out of darkness let light shine,” is He who has shone in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s glory, which is radiant on the face of Christ. Treasure in Jars of Clay (Romans 6:1–14)"
2 Corinthians,4,7,"But we have this treasure in a fragile vase of clay, in order that the surpassing greatness of the power"
2 Corinthians,4,8,"We are hard pressed, yet never in absolute distress; perplexed, yet never utterly baffled; 9pursued, yet never left unsuccoured; struck to the ground, yet never slain; 10always, wherever we go, carrying with us in our bodies the putting to death"
2 Corinthians,4,11,"For we, alive though we are, are continually surrendering ourselves to death for the sake of Jesus, so that in this mortal nature"
2 Corinthians,4,12,"Thus we are constantly dying, while you are in full enjoyment of Life."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"But possessing the same Spirit of faith as he who wrote, “I believed, and therefore I have spoken,”"
2 Corinthians,4,14,"For we know that He who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will raise us also to be with Jesus, and will cause both us and you to stand in His own presence."
2 Corinthians,4,15,"For everything is for your sakes, in order that grace, being more richly bestowed because of the thanksgivings of the increased number, may more and more promote the glory of God."
2 Corinthians,4,16,"Therefore we are not cowards. Nay, even though our outward man is wasting away, yet our inward"
2 Corinthians,4,17,"For this our light and transitory burden of suffering is achieving for us a preponderating, yes, a vastly preponderating, and eternal weight of glory; 18while we look not at things seen, but things unseen; for things seen are temporary, but things unseen are eternal."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"For we know that if this poor tent, our earthly house, is taken down, we have in Heaven a building"
2 Corinthians,5,2,"For in this one we sigh, because we long to put on over it our dwelling which comes from Heaven— 3if indeed having really"
2 Corinthians,5,4,"Yes, we who are in this tent certainly do sigh under our burdens, for we do not wish to lay aside that with which we are now clothed, but to put on"
2 Corinthians,5,5,"And He who formed us with this very end in view is God, who has given us His Spirit as a pledge and foretaste of that bliss."
2 Corinthians,5,6,We have therefore a cheerful confidence. We know that while we are at home in the body we are

2 Corinthians,5,9,"And for this reason also we make it our ambition, whether at home or in exile, to please"
2 Corinthians,5,10,"For we must all of us appear before Christ’s judgement-seat in our true characters, in order that each may then receive an award for his actions in this life, in accordance with what he has done, whether it be good or whether it be worthless. Ambassadors for Christ"
2 Corinthians,5,11,"Therefore, because we realize how greatly the Lord is to be feared, we are endeavouring to win men over, and God recognizes what our motives are, and I hope that you, in your hearts, recognize them"
2 Corinthians,5,12,"We are not again commending ourselves to your favour, but are furnishing you with a ground of boasting on our behalf, so that you may have a reply ready for those with whom superficial"
2 Corinthians,5,13,"For if we have been beside ourselves, it has been for God’s glory; or if we are now in our right senses, it is in order to be of service"
2 Corinthians,5,14,"For the love of Christ overmasters us, the conclusion at which we have arrived being this— that One having died for all, His death was their death, 15and that He died for all in order that the living may no longer live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and rose again."
2 Corinthians,5,16,"Therefore for the future we know no one simply as a man. Even if we have known Christ as a man,"
2 Corinthians,5,17,"So that if any one is in Christ, he is a new creature: the old state of"
2 Corinthians,5,18,"And all this is from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ, and has appointed us to serve in the ministry of"
2 Corinthians,5,19,"We are to tell how God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not charging men’s transgressions to their account, and that He has entrusted to us the Message of this reconciliation."

2 Corinthians,6,2,"For He says, “At a time of welcome I have listened to you, and on a day of salvation I have succoured you.” Now is the time of loving welcome! Now is the day of salvation!"
2 Corinthians,6,3,"We endeavour to give people no cause for stumbling in anything, lest the work we are doing should"
2 Corinthians,6,4,"On the contrary, as God’s servants, we seek their full approval—by unwearied endurance, by afflictions, by distress, by helplessness; 5by floggings, by imprisonments; by facing riots, by toil, by sleepless watching, by hunger and thirst; 6by purity of life, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love; 7by the proclamation of the truth, by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness, wielded in both hands; 8through honour and ignominy, through calumny and praise. We are looked upon as impostors and yet are true men; 9as obscure persons, and yet are well known; as on the point of death, and yet, strange to tell, we live; as under God’s discipline, and yet we are not deprived of life; 10as sad, but we are always joyful; as poor, but we bestow wealth on many; as having nothing, and yet we securely possess all things."

2 Corinthians,6,14,"Do not come into close association with unbelievers, like oxen yoked with asses. For what is there in common between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what partnership has light with darkness?"
2 Corinthians,6,15,Where can harmony between Christ and Belial be found? Or what participation has a believer with an unbeliever?
2 Corinthians,6,16,"And what compact has the Temple of God with idols? For *we* are the Temple of the ever-living God; as God has said, “I will dwell among them, and walk about among them; and will be their God, and it is they who shall be My people.”"
2 Corinthians,6,17,"Therefore, “’Come out from among them and separate yourselves,’ says the Lord, ‘and touch nothing impure; and I will receive you, and will be a Father to you, 18and you shall be My sons and daughters,’ says the Lord the Ruler of all.”"

You have completely wiped away reproach from yourselves in the matter."
2 Corinthians,7,12,"Therefore, though I wrote to you, it was not to punish the offender, nor to secure justice for him who had suffered the wrong, but it was chiefly in order that your earnest feeling on our behalf might"

Galatians,3,21,"God, however, is only one. Is the Law then opposed to the promises of God? No, indeed; for if a Law had been given which could have conferred Life, righteousness would certainly have come by the Law."
Galatians,3,22,"But Scripture has shown that all mankind are the prisoners of sin, in order that the promised blessing, which depends on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who believe."
Galatians,3,23,"Before this faith came, we Jews were perpetual prisoners under the Law, living under restraints and"
Galatians,3,24,"So that the Law has acted the part of a tutor-slave to lead us to Christ, in order that through faith we may be declared to be free"
Galatians,3,25,"But now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor-slave. Sons through Faith in Christ"

Galatians,4,11,"I am alarmed about you, and am afraid that I have perhaps bestowed labour upon you to no purpose."

Galatians,4,13,"And you know that in those early days it was on account of bodily infirmity that I proclaimed the Good News to you, 14and yet the bodily infirmity which was such a trial to you, you did not regard with contempt or loathing, but you received me as if I had been an angel of God or"
Galatians,4,15,"I ask you, then, what has become of your self-congratulations? For I bear you witness that had it been possible you would have torn out your own eyes and have given them to me."
Galatians,4,16,Can it be that I have become your enemy through speaking the truth to you?

Galatians,4,21,Tell me—you who want to continue to be subject to Law—will you not listen to the Law?
Galatians,4,22,For it is
Galatians,4,23,But we see that the child of the slave-girl was born in the common course of nature; but the child of the free
Galatians,4,24,All this is allegorical; for the women represent two Covenants.
Galatians,4,25,"This is Hagar; for the name Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, which is in"
Galatians,4,26,"But the Jerusalem which is above is free, and *she* is *our* mother."
Galatians,4,27,"For it is written, “Rejoice, thou barren woman that bearest not, break forth into a joyful cry, thou that dost not travail with child. For the desolate woman has many children—more indeed than she who has the husband.”"
Galatians,4,28,"But you, brethren, like Isaac, are children born in fulfilment of a promise."
Galatians,4,29,"Yet just as, at that time, the child born in the common course of nature persecuted the one whose birth was due to the power of the Spirit, so it is now."
Galatians,4,30,"But what says the Scripture? “Send away the slave-girl and her son, for never shall the slave-girl’s son share the inheritance with the son of the free woman.”"
Galatians,4,31,"Therefore, brethren, since we are not the children of a slave-girl, but of the free woman—"
Galatians,5,1,Christ having made us gloriously free—stand fast and do not again be hampered with the yoke of slavery.
Galatians,5,2,Remember that it is I Paul who tell you that if you receive circumcision Christ will avail you nothing.
Galatians,5,3,I once more protest to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation to obey the

Fornication, impurity, indecency, idol-worship, sorcery; 20enmity, strife, jealousy, outbursts of passion, intrigues, dissensions, factions, envyings; 21hard drinking, riotous feasting, and the like. And as to these I forewarn you, as I have already forewarned you, that those who are guilty of such things"
Galatians,5,22,"The Spirit, on the other hand, brings a harvest of love, joy, peace; patience towards others, kindness, benevolence; 23good faith, meekness, self-restraint."
Galatians,5,24,Against such things as these there is no law. Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their lower nature with its passions and appetites.
Galatians,5,25,"If we are living by the Spirit’s power, let our conduct also be governed by the Spirit’s power."
Galatians,5,26,"Let us not become vain-glorious, challenging one another, envying one another."
Galatians,6,1,"Brethren, if anybody be detected in any misconduct, you who are spiritual should restore such a one in a spirit of meekness. And let each of you keep watch over himself, lest he also fall into temptation."

Galatians,6,12,"All who desire to display their zeal for external observances try to compel you to receive circumcision, but their real object is simply to"
Galatians,6,13,"For these very men do not really keep the Law of Moses, but they would have you receive circumcision in order that they may glory in *your* bodies."
Galatians,6,14,"But as for me, God forbid that I should glory in anything except the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
Galatians,6,15,For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any importance; but only a renewed nature.
Galatians,6,16,And all who shall regulate their lives by this principle—may peace and mercy be given to them—and to the true Israel of God.

His design was to unite the two sections of humanity in Himself so as to form one new man, 16thus effecting peace, and to reconcile Jews and Gentiles in one body to God, by means of His cross—slaying by it"
Ephesians,2,17,"So He came and proclaimed good news of peace to you who were so far away, and peace to those who were near; 18because it is through Him that Jews and Gentiles alike have access through one Spirit to the Father. Christ Our Cornerstone (Isaiah 28:14–22; 1 Corinthians 3:10–15; 1 Peter 2:1–8)"
Ephesians,2,19,You are therefore no longer mere foreigners or persons excluded from civil rights. On the contrary

Philippians,1,23,"I am in a dilemma, my earnest desire being to depart and be with Christ, for that is far, far better."
Philippians,1,24,But for your sakes it is more important that I should still remain in the body.
Philippians,1,25,"I am convinced of this, and I know that I shall remain, and shall go on working side by side with you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith; 26so that, as Christians, you may have additional reason for glorying about me as the result of my being with you again. Worthy of the Gospel"
Philippians,1,27,"Only let the lives you live be worthy of the Good News of the Christ, in order that, whether I come and see you or, being absent, only hear of you, I may know that you are standing fast in one spirit and"
Philippians,1,28,"Never for a moment quail before your antagonists. Your fearlessness will be to them a sure token of impending destruction,"
Philippians,1,29,"For you have had the privilege granted you on behalf of Christ—not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer on His behalf; 30maintaining, as you do, the same kind of conflict that you once saw in me and which you still hear that I am engaged in."
Philippians,2,1,"If then I can appeal to you as the followers of Christ, if there is any persuasive power in love and any common sharing of the Spirit, or if you have any tender-heartedness and compassion, make my joy complete by being of one mind, 2united by mutual love, with harmony of feeling giving your minds to"
Philippians,2,3,"Do nothing in a spirit of factiousness or of vainglory, but, with true humility, let every one regard the rest as being of more account than himself; 4each fixing his attention, not simply on his own interests, but on those of others also. The Mind of Christ (Isaiah 52:13–15)"
Philippians,2,5,Let the same disposition be in you which was in Christ Jesus.
Philippians,2,6,Although from the beginning He had
Philippians,2,7,"Nay, He stripped Himself of His glory, and took on Him the nature of a bondservant by becoming a man like"
Philippians,2,8,"And being recognized as truly human, He humbled Himself and even stooped to die; yes,"
Philippians,2,9,"It is in consequence of this that God has also so highly exalted Him, and has conferred on Him the Name which is supreme above every other, 10in order that in the Name of JESUS every knee should bow, of beings in Heaven, of those on the earth, and of those in the underworld, 11and that every tongue should confess that JESUS CHRIST is LORD, to the glory of God the Father. Lights in the World (Matthew 5:13–16)"
Philippians,2,12,"Therefore, my dearly-loved friends, as I have always found you obedient, labour earnestly with fear and trembling—not merely as though I were present with you, but much more now since I am absent"
Philippians,2,13,For it is God Himself whose power creates within you the desire to do His gracious will and also brings about the accomplishment of the desire.
Philippians,2,14,"Be ever on your guard against a grudging and contentious spirit, 15so that you may always prove yourselves to be blameless and spotless—irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as heavenly lights in the world, 16holding out to them a Message of Life. It will then be my glory on the day of Christ that I did not run my race in vain nor"
Philippians,2,17,"Nay, even if my life is to be poured as a libation upon the sacrificial offering of your faith,"
Philippians,2,18,"And I bid you also share my gladness, and congratulate me. Timothy and Epaphroditus (1 Corinthians 16:10–12)"
Philippians,2,19,"But, if the Lord permits it, I hope before long to send Timothy to you, that I, in turn, may be cheered"
Philippians,2,20,"For I have no one likeminded with him, who will cherish a genuine care for"
Philippians,2,21,"Everybody concerns himself about his own interests, not about those of Jesus Christ."
Philippians,2,22,"But you know Timothy’s approved worth—how, like a child working with his father, he has served with me in"
Philippians,2,23,"So it is he that I hope to send as soon as ever I see how things go with me; 24but trusting, as I do, in the Lord, I believe that I shall myself also come to you before long."
Philippians,2,25,Yet I deem it important to send Epaphroditus to you now—he is my brother and comrade both in
Philippians,2,26,I send him because he

Philippians,2,28,"I am therefore all the more eager to send him, in the hope that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have the less sorrow."
Philippians,2,29,"Receive him therefore with heartfelt Christian joy, and hold in honour men like him; 30because it was for the sake of Christ’s work that he came so near death, hazarding, as he did, his very life in endeavouring to make good any deficiency that there might be in your gifts to me."
Philippians,3,1,"In conclusion, my brethren, be joyful in the Lord. For me to give you the same warnings as before is not irksome to me, while so far as you are concerned it is a safe precaution."
Philippians,3,2,"Beware of ‘the dogs,’ the bad workmen, the self-mutilators."
Philippians,3,3,"For we are the true circumcision—we who render to God a spiritual worship and make our boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in outward ceremonies: 4although I myself might have some excuse for confidence in outward ceremonies. If any one else claims a right to trust in them, far more may I: 5circumcised, as I was, on the eighth day, a member of the race of Israel and of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew sprung from Hebrews; as to the Law a Pharisee; 6as to zeal, a persecutor of the Church; as to the righteousness which comes through Law, blameless."
Philippians,3,7,Yet all that was gain to me—for Christ’s sake I have reckoned it loss.
Philippians,3,8,"Nay, I even reckon all things as pure loss because of the priceless privilege of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. And for His sake I have suffered the loss of everything, and reckon it all as mere refuse, in order that I may win Christ and be found in union with Him, 9not having a righteousness of my own, derived from the Law, but that which"
Philippians,3,10,"I long to know Christ and the power which is in His resurrection, and to share in His sufferings and die even as He died; 11in the hope that I may attain to the resurrection from among the dead. Pressing on toward the Goal"
Philippians,3,12,I do not say that I have already won the race or have already reached perfection. But I am pressing
Philippians,3,13,"Brethren, I do not imagine that I have yet laid hold of it. But this one thing I do—forgetting everything which is past and stretching forward to what lies in front of me, 14with my eyes fixed on the goal I push on to secure"
Philippians,3,15,"Therefore let all of us who are mature believers cherish these thoughts; and if in any respect you think differently, that also God will make clear to you."
Philippians,3,16,"But whatever be the point that we have already reached, let us persevere in the same course. Citizenship in Heaven"
Philippians,3,17,"Brethren, vie with one another in imitating me, and carefully observe those who follow the example"
Philippians,3,18,"For there are many whom I have often described to you, and I now even"
Philippians,3,19,"Their end is destruction, their"
Philippians,3,20,"We, however, are free citizens of Heaven, and we are waiting with longing expectation for the coming from Heaven of a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21who, in the exercise of the power which He has even to subject all things to Himself, will transform this body of our humiliation until it resembles His own glorious body."
Philippians,4,1,"Therefore, my brethren, dearly loved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my dearly-loved ones."
Philippians,4,2,"I entreat Euodia, and I entreat Syntyche, to be of one mind, as sisters in Christ."
Philippians,4,3,"Yes, and I beg you also, my faithful yoke-fellow, to help these women who have shared my toil in connection with the Good News, together with Clement and the rest of my fellow labourers, whose names are recorded in the Book of Life."
Philippians,4,4,"Always be glad in the Lord: I will repeat it, be glad."
Philippians,4,5,Let your forbearing spirit be known to every
Philippians,4,6,"Do not be over-anxious about anything, but by prayer and earnest pleading,"
Philippians,4,7,"And then the peace of God, which transcends all our powers of thought, will be a garrison to guard your hearts and minds in union with Christ Jesus."
Philippians,4,8,"Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever wins respect, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovable, whatever is of good repute—if there is any virtue or anything deemed worthy of"
Philippians,4,9,The doctrines and the line of conduct which I taught you—both what you heard and what you saw in me—hold fast to them; and God who gives peace will be with you. The Generosity of the Philippians (2 Corinthians 8:1–15)
Philippians,4,10,But I rejoice with a deep and holy joy that now at length you have revived your thoughtfulness for

He is to you a faithful minister of Christ in our stead, 8and moreover he has informed us of your love, which is inspired by the Spirit."
Colossians,1,9,"For this reason we also, from the day we first received these tidings, have never ceased to pray for you and to entreat that you may be filled with a clear knowledge of His will accompanied by thorough wisdom and discernment in spiritual things; 10so that your lives may be worthy of the Lord and perfectly pleasing to Him, while you exhibit the results of right action of every sort and grow into a fuller"

Colossians,1,22,"He has now, in His human body, reconciled to God by His death, to bring you, holy and faultless and irreproachable, into His presence; 23if, indeed, you are still firmly holding to faith as your foundation, without ever shifting from your hope that rests on the Good News that you have heard, which has been proclaimed in the whole creation under Heaven, and in which I Paul have been appointed to serve.

1 Timothy,1,3,"When I was on my journey to Macedonia I begged you to remain on in Ephesus that you might remonstrate with certain persons because of their erroneous teaching 4and the attention they bestow on mere fables and endless pedigrees, such as lead to controversy rather than to a true stewardship"

1 Timothy,1,6,"From these some have drifted away, and have wandered into empty words."
1 Timothy,1,7,"They are ambitious to be teachers of the Law, although they do not understand either their own words or what the things are about which they make such confident assertions."
1 Timothy,1,8,"Now we know that the Law is good, if a man uses it in the way it should be used, 9and remembers that a law is not enacted to control a righteous man, but for the lawless and rebellious, the irreligious and sinful, the godless and profane—for those who strike their fathers or their mothers, for murderers, 10fornicators, sodomites, slave-dealers, liars and false witnesses; and for whatever else is opposed to wholesome teaching 11and is not in accordance with the Good News of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted. God’s Grace to Paul"
1 Timothy,1,12,"I am thankful to Him who made me strong—even Christ Jesus our Lord—because He has judged me to be faithful and has put me into His service, 13though I was previously a blasphemer and a persecutor and had been insolent in outrage. Yet mercy was shown me, because I had acted ignorantly, not having as yet believed; 14and the grace of our Lord came to me in overflowing fulness, conferring faith on me"
1 Timothy,1,15,"Faithful is the saying, and deserving of universal acceptance,"

1 Timothy,1,20,"Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme."
1 Timothy,2,1,"I exhort then, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all men; 2including kings and all who are in high station, in order that we may live peaceful"

1 Timothy,3,1,"Faithful is the saying, “If any one is eager to have the oversight of a Church, he desires a noble work.”"
1 Timothy,3,2,"A minister then must be a man of irreproachable character, true to his one wife, temperate, sober- minded, well-behaved, hospitable to strangers, and with a gift for teaching; 3not a hard drinker nor given to blows; not selfish or quarrelsome or covetous; 4but ruling his own household wisely and well,"
1 Timothy,3,6,"He ought not to be a new convert, for fear he"
1 Timothy,3,7,"It is needful also that he bear a good character with people outside the Church, lest he fall into reproach or a snare of the Devil. Qualifications for Deacons (Acts 6:1–7)"
1 Timothy,3,8,"Deacons, in the same way, must be men of serious demeanour, not double-tongued, nor addicted to much wine, nor greedy of base gain, 9but holding the secret truths of the faith with a clear conscience."
1 Timothy,3,10,"And they must also be well-tried men, and when found to be of unblemished character then let them"

1 Timothy,3,13,"For those who have filled the deacon’s office wisely and well, are already gaining for themselves an honourable standing, and are acquiring great freedom of speech in proclaiming the faith which rests on Christ Jesus. The Mystery of Godliness"
1 Timothy,3,14,"All this I write to you, though I am hoping before long to come to see you."
1 Timothy,3,15,"But, for fear I may be hindered, I now write, so that you may have rules to guide you in dealing with God’s household. For this is what the Church of the ever-living God is, and it is the pillar and foundation-stone of the truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,"And, beyond controversy, great is the mystery of our religion—that Christ appeared in human form, and His claims justified by the Spirit, was seen by angels and proclaimed among Gentile nations, was believed on in the world, and received up again into glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,"Now the Spirit expressly declares that in later times some will fall away from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and the teachings of demons; 2through the hypocrisy of men who teach falsely and have their own consciences seared as with a hot iron; 3forbidding people to marry, and insisting on abstinence from foods which God has created to be partaken of, with thankfulness, by those who"
1 Timothy,4,4,"For everything that God has created is good, and"
1 Timothy,4,5,For it is made holy by the word of God and by prayer. A Good Servant of Jesus Christ
1 Timothy,4,6,"If you warn the brethren of these dangers you will be a good and faithful servant of Christ Jesus, inwardly feeding on the lessons of the faith and of the sound teaching of which you have been, and"
1 Timothy,4,7,"But worldly stories, fit only for credulous old women, have nothing to do with."
1 Timothy,4,8,"Train yourself in godliness. Exercise for the body is not useless, but godliness is useful in every respect,"
1 Timothy,4,9,"Faithful is this saying and deserving of universal acceptance: 10and here is the motive of our toiling and wrestling, because we have our hopes fixed on the ever-living God, who is the Saviour of all mankind, and especially of believers."
1 Timothy,4,11,Command this and teach this.
1 Timothy,4,12,Let no one think slightingly of you because you are a young man;

1 Timothy,4,15,"Habitually practise these duties, and be absorbed in them;"
1 Timothy,4,16,Be on your guard as to yourself and your teaching. Persevere in these things; for by doing this you will make certain your own salvation and that of your hearers.
1 Timothy,5,1,"Never administer a sharp reprimand to a man older than yourself; but entreat him as if he were your father, and the younger men as brothers; 2the elder women too as mothers, and the younger women as sisters, with perfect modesty. Honoring True Widows (Ruth 1:1–5)"
1 Timothy,5,3,Honour widows who are really in need.
1 Timothy,5,4,"But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let these learn first to show piety towards their own homes and to prove their gratitude to their parents; for this is"
1 Timothy,5,5,"A widow who is really in need, friendless and desolate, has her hopes fixed on God, and continues at her supplications and prayers, night and day; 6but a pleasure-loving"

1 Timothy,5,8,"But if a man makes no provision for those dependent on him, and especially for his own family, he has disowned the faith and is behaving worse than an unbeliever."
1 Timothy,5,9,No widow is to be put on the roll who is under sixty years of age.

1 Timothy,5,15,For already some of them have gone
1 Timothy,5,16,"If a believing woman has widows dependent on her, she should relieve their wants, and save the Church from being burdened—so that the Church may relieve the widows who are really in need. Honoring Elders"

1 Timothy,5,21,"I solemnly call upon you, in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels, to carry"
1 Timothy,5,22,Do not ordain any one hastily; and do not be a partaker in the sins of others; keep *yourself* pure. 23
1 Timothy,5,24,"The sins of some men are evident to the world, leading the way to your estimate of their characters,"
1 Timothy,5,25,"So also the right actions of some are evident to the world, and those that are not cannot remain for ever out of sight."
1 Timothy,6,1,"Let all who are under the yoke of slavery hold their own masters to be deserving of honour, so that"
1 Timothy,6,2,"And those who have believing masters should not be wanting in respect towards them because they are their brethren, but should serve them all the more willingly because those who profit by the faithful service rendered are believers and are friends. Reject False Doctrines"
1 Timothy,6,3,"So teach and exhort. If any one is a teacher of any other kind of doctrine, and refuses assent to wholesome instructions—those of our Lord Jesus Christ—and the teaching that harmonizes with true godliness, 4he is puffed up with pride and has no true knowledge, but is crazy over discussions and controversies about words which give rise to envy, quarrelling, revilings, ill-natured suspicions, 5and persistent wranglings on the part of people whose intellects are disordered and they themselves blinded to all knowledge of the truth; who imagine that godliness means gain. Godliness with Contentment"
1 Timothy,6,6,"And godliness *is* gain, when associated with contentment; 7for we brought nothing into the world, nor can we carry anything out of it; 8and if we have food and clothing, with these we will be satisfied."
1 Timothy,6,9,"But people who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many unwise and"
1 Timothy,6,10,For from love of money all sorts of evils arise; and some have so hankered after money as to be led astray from the faith and be pierced through with countless sorrows. Fight the Good Fight
1 Timothy,6,11,"But you, O man of God, must flee from these things; and strive for uprightness, godliness, good"
1 Timothy,6,12,"Exert all your strength in the honourable struggle for the faith; lay hold of the Life of the Ages, to which you were called, when you made your noble"
1 Timothy,6,13,"I charge you—as in the presence of God who gives life to all creatures, and of Christ Jesus who at the bar of Pontius Pilate made a noble profession of faith— 14that you keep God’s commandments stainlessly and without reproach till the Appearing of our Lord"
1 Timothy,6,15,"For, as its appointed time, this will be brought about by the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 16who alone possesses immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, and whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be eternal honour and power! Amen. A Charge to the Rich (Proverbs 23:1–5; James 5:1–6)"
1 Timothy,6,17,Impress on those who are rich in the present age that they must not be haughty nor set their hopes on riches—that unstable foundation—but on God who provides us richly with all things for our
1 Timothy,6,18,"They must be beneficent, rich in noble deeds, open-handed and liberal; 19storing up for themselves that which shall be a solid foundation for the future, that they may lay hold of the Life which is life indeed. Guard the Faith"
1 Timothy,6,20,"O Timothy, guard the truths entrusted to you, shunning irreligious and frivolous talk, and controversy with what is falsely called ‘knowledge’; 21of which some have spoken boastfully in connexion with the true faith, and have erred. Grace be with you all."
2 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, for proclaiming the promise of the Life which is in Christ Jesus:"
2 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy my dearly-loved child. May grace, mercy and peace be granted to you from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Faithfulness under Persecution (Matthew 10:16–25)"
2 Timothy,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve with a pure conscience—as my forefathers did—that night and day I unceasingly remember you in my prayers, 4being always mindful of your tears, and longing to see you"
2 Timothy,1,5,"For I recall the sincere faith which is in your heart—a faith which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and then in your mother Eunice, and, I am fully convinced, now dwells in you also."
2 Timothy,1,6,For this reason let me remind you to rekindle God’s gift which is yours through the laying on of my
2 Timothy,1,7,"For the Spirit which God has given us is not a spirit of cowardice, but one of power and of love and of sound judgement."
2 Timothy,1,8,Do not be ashamed then to bear witness for our Lord and for me His prisoner; but rather share
2 Timothy,1,9,"For He saved us and called us with a holy call, not in accordance with our desserts, but in accordance with His own purpose and the free grace which He bestowed on us in Christ Jesus before the commencement of the Ages, 10but which has now been plainly revealed through the Appearing of our Saviour, Christ Jesus. He has put an end to death and has brought Life and Immortality to light through the Good News, 11of"
2 Timothy,1,12,"That indeed is the reason why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know in whom my trust reposes, and I am confident that He has it in His power to keep what I have entrusted to Him safe until that day. Holding to Sound Teaching"

2 Timothy,3,1,But of this be assured: in the last days grievous times will set in.
2 Timothy,3,2,"For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, profane. They will be disobedient to parents, thankless, irreligious, 3destitute of natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers. They will have no self-control, but will be brutal, opposed to goodness, 4treacherous, headstrong, self-important. They will love pleasure instead of loving God, 5and will keep up a make-believe of piety and yet live in defiance of its power. Turn away"

Titus,1,5,"I have left you behind in Crete in order that you may set right the things which still require attention, and appoint Elders in every town, as I directed you to do; 6wherever there is a man of blameless life, true to his one wife, having children who are themselves believers and are free from every reproach"
Titus,1,7,"For, as God’s steward, a minister must be of blameless life, not over-fond of having his own way, not a man of a passionate temper nor a hard drinker, not given to blows nor greedy of gain, 8but hospitable to strangers, a lover of goodness, sober-minded, upright, saintly, self-controlled; 9holding fast to the faithful Message which he has received, so that he may be well qualified both to encourage others with sound teaching and to reply successfully to opponents.

Titus,2,1,"But as for you, you must speak in a manner that befits wholesome teaching."
Titus,2,2,"Exhort aged men to be temperate, grave, sober-minded, robust in their faith, their love and their patience."
Titus,2,3,In the same way exhort aged women to let their conduct be such as becomes consecrated persons. They must not be slanderers nor enslaved to wine-drinking. They must be teachers of what is right.
Titus,2,4,"They should school the young women to be affectionate to their husbands and to their children, to be sober-minded, pure in their lives, 5industrious in their homes, kind, submissive to their husbands, so that the Christian teaching may not be exposed to reproach."
Titus,2,6,"In the same way exhort the younger men to be discreet, 7and above all make your own life a pattern of right conduct, having in your teaching no taint of insincerity, but a serious tone, 8and healthy language which no one can censure, so that our opponents may feel ashamed at having nothing evil to say against us."
Titus,2,9,"Exhort slaves to be always obedient to their owners, and to give them satisfaction in everything, not contradicting and not pilfering, 10but manifesting perfect fidelity and kind feeling, in order to bring honour to the teaching of our Saviour, God, in all things. God’s Grace Brings Salvation"
Titus,2,11,"For the grace of God has displayed itself with healing power to all mankind, 12training us to renounce ungodliness and all the pleasures of this world, and to live sober, upright, and pious lives at the present time, 13in expectation of the fulfilment of our blessed hope—the Appearing in glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ; 14who gave Himself for us to purchase our freedom from all iniquity, and purify for Himself a people who should be specially His own, zealous for doing good works."
Titus,2,15,"Thus speak, exhort, reprove, with all impressiveness. Let no one make light of your authority."
Titus,3,1,"Remind people that they must submit to the rulers who are in authority over them; that they must obey the magistrates, be prepared for every right action, 2not speak evil of any one, nor be contentious, but yield unselfishly to others and constantly manifest a forgiving spirit towards all men."
Titus,3,3,"For there was a time when we also were deficient in understanding, obstinate, deluded, the slaves of various cravings and pleasures, spending our lives in malice and envy, hateful ourselves and hating"
Titus,3,4,"But when the goodness of God our Saviour, and His love to man, dawned upon us, not in consequence of things which we, 5as righteous men, had done, but as the result of His own mercy He saved us by means of the bath of regeneration and the renewal of our natures by the Holy Spirit, 6which He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 7in order that having been declared righteous through His grace we might become heirs to the Life of the Ages in fulfilment of our hopes."
Titus,3,8,"This is a faithful saying, and on these various points I would have you insist strenuously, in order that those who have their faith fixed on God may be careful to set an example of good actions. For these are not only good in themselves, but are also useful to mankind. Avoid Divisions (Romans 16:17–20)"
Titus,3,9,But hold yourself aloof from foolish controversies and pedigrees and discussions and wrangling about

Hebrews,1,1,"God, who in ancient days spoke to our forefathers in many distinct messages and by various methods through the Prophets, 2has at the end of these days spoken to us through a Son, who is the pre-"
Hebrews,1,3,"He brightly reflects God’s glory and is the exact representation of His being, and upholds the universe by His all-powerful word. After securing man’s purification from sin He took His seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 4having become as far superior to the angels as the Name He possesses by inheritance is more excellent than theirs."
Hebrews,1,5,"For to which of the angels did God ever say, “My Son art Thou: I have this day become Thy Father;” and again, “I will be a Father to Him, and He shall be My Son”?"
Hebrews,1,6,"But speaking of the time when He once more brings His Firstborn into the world, He says, “And let all God’s angels worship Him.”"
Hebrews,1,7,"Moreover of the angels He says, “He changes His angels into winds, and His ministering servants into a flame of fire.”"
Hebrews,1,8,"But of His Son, He says, “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and for ever, and the sceptre of Thy Kingdom is a sceptre of absolute justice."
Hebrews,1,9,"Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Thy God, has anointed Thee with the oil of gladness beyond Thy companions.”"
Hebrews,1,10,"It is also of His Son that God says, “Thou, O Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands."
Hebrews,1,11,"The heavens will perish, but Thou remainest; and they will all grow old like a garment, 12and, as though they were a mantle Thou wilt roll them up; yes, like a garment, and they will undergo change. But Thou art the same, and Thy years will never come to an end.”"
Hebrews,1,13,"To which of the angels has He ever said, “Sit at My right hand till I make Thy foes a footstool for Thy feet”?"
Hebrews,1,14,"Are not all angels spirits that serve Him—whom He sends out to render service for the benefit of those who, before long, will inherit salvation?"
Hebrews,2,1,"For this reason we ought to pay the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, for fear"
Hebrews,2,2,"For if the message delivered through angels proved to be true, and every transgression and act of disobedience met with just retribution, 3how shall *we* escape if we are indifferent to a salvation as great as that now offered to us? This, after having first of all been announced by the Lord Himself, had its truth made sure to us by those who heard Him, 4while God corroborated their testimony by signs and marvels and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed in accordance with His own will. Jesus like His Brothers"
Hebrews,2,5,"It is not to angels that God has assigned the sovereignty of that coming world, of which we speak."
Hebrews,2,6,"But, as we know, a writer has solemnly said, “How poor a creature is man, and yet Thou dost remember him, and a son of man, and yet Thou dost come to him!"
Hebrews,2,7,"Thou hast made him only a little inferior to the angels; with glory and honour Thou hast crowned him, and hast set him to govern the works of Thy hands."
Hebrews,2,8,Thou hast put everything in subjection under his feet.” For this subjecting of the universe to man implies the leaving nothing not subject to him. But we do not as yet see the universe subject to him.
Hebrews,2,9,But Jesus—who was made a little inferior to the angels in order that through God’s grace He might taste death for every human being—we already see wearing a crown of glory and honour because of His having suffered death.
Hebrews,2,10,"For it was fitting that He for whom, and through whom, all things exist, after He had brought many"
Hebrews,2,11,"For both He who sanctifies and those whom He is sanctifying have all one Father; and for this reason He is not ashamed to speak of them as His brothers; 12as when He says: “I will proclaim Thy name to My brothers: in the midst of the congregation I will hymn Thy praises;” 13and again, “As for Me, I will be one whose trust reposes in God;” and again, “Here am I, and here are the children God has given Me.”"
Hebrews,2,14,"Since then the children referred to are all alike sharers in perishable human nature, He Himself also, in the same way, took on Him a share of it, in order that through death He might render powerless him who had authority over death, that is, the Devil, 15and might set at liberty all those who through"
Hebrews,2,16,For assuredly it is not to angels that He is

Do Not Harden Your Hearts (Psalm 95:1–11)"
Hebrews,3,7,"For this reason—as the Holy Spirit warns us, “To-day, if you hear His voice, 8do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time of the provocation on the day of the temptation in the Desert, 9where your forefathers so sorely tried My patience and saw all that I did during forty years."
Hebrews,3,10,"Therefore I was greatly grieved with that generation, and I said, ‘They are ever going astray in heart, and have not learnt to know My paths.’"

Hebrews,3,13,"On the contrary encourage one another, day after day, so long as To-day lasts, so that not one of you may be hardened through"
Hebrews,3,14,"For we have, all alike, become sharers with Christ, if we really hold our first confidence firm to the End; 15seeing that the warning still comes to us, “To-day, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time of the provocation.”"
Hebrews,3,16,"For who were they that heard, and yet provoked God? Was it not the whole of the people who had"
Hebrews,3,17,And with whom was God so greatly grieved for
Hebrews,3,18,"And to whom did He swear that they should not be admitted to His rest, if it was not to those who were"

Hebrews,4,1,"Therefore let us be on our guard lest perhaps, while He still leaves us a promise of being admitted to"
Hebrews,4,2,"For Good News has been brought to us as truly as to them; but the message they heard failed to benefit them, because they were not one in faith with those who gave heed to it."
Hebrews,4,3,"We who have believed are soon to be admitted to the true rest; as He has said, “As I swore in My anger, they shall not be admitted to My rest,” although God’s works had been going on ever since the creation of the world."
Hebrews,4,4,"For, as we know, when speaking of the seventh day He has used the words, “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works;” 5and He has also declared, “They shall not be admitted to My rest.”"
Hebrews,4,6,"Since, then, it is still true that some will be admitted to that rest, and that because of disobedience those who formerly had Good News proclaimed to them were not admitted,"
Hebrews,4,7,"He again definitely mentions a certain day, “To-day,” saying long afterwards, by David’s lips, in the words already quoted, “To-day, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”"
Hebrews,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them the true rest, we should not afterwards hear God speaking of another"
Hebrews,4,9,It follows that there still remains a sabbath rest for the people of God.

Hebrews,4,12,"For God’s Message is full of life and power, and is keener than the sharpest two-edged sword. It pierces even to the severance of soul from spirit, and penetrates between the joints and the marrow,"
Hebrews,4,13,And no created thing is able to escape its scrutiny; but everything lies bare and completely exposed before the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.
Hebrews,4,14,"Inasmuch, then, as we have in Jesus, the Son of God, a great High Priest who has passed into"
Hebrews,4,15,"For we have not a High Priest who is unable to feel for us in our weaknesses, but one who was tempted in every respect just as we are tempted,"
Hebrews,4,16,"Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our times of need."
Hebrews,5,1,"For every High Priest is chosen from among men, and is appointed to act on behalf of men in matters relating to God, in order to offer both gifts and sin-offerings, 2and must be one who is able to bear"
Hebrews,5,3,And for this
Hebrews,5,4,"And no one takes this honourable office upon himself, but only accepts it when called to it by God, as Aaron was."
Hebrews,5,5,"So Christ also did not claim for Himself the honour of being made High Priest, but was appointed to it by Him who said to Him, “My Son art Thou: I have to-day become Thy Father;” 6as also in another passage He says, “Thou art a priest for ever, belonging to the order of Melchizedek.”"

Hebrews,5,11,"Concerning Him we have much to say, and much that it would be difficult to make clear to you, since"
Hebrews,5,12,"For although, considering the long time you have been believers, you ought now to be teachers of others, you really need some one to teach you over again"
Hebrews,5,13,By people who live on milk I mean those who are imperfectly acquainted with the teaching concerning
Hebrews,5,14,"Such persons are mere babes. But solid food is for adults—that is, for those who through constant practice have their spiritual faculties carefully trained to distinguish good from evil."
Hebrews,6,1,"Therefore leaving elementary instruction about the Christ, let us advance to mature manhood and not be continually re-laying a foundation of repentance from lifeless works and of faith in God, 2or of teaching about ceremonial washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and the last"
Hebrews,6,3,"And advance we will, if God permits us to do so."
Hebrews,6,4,"For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once for all been enlightened, and have tasted the sweetness of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, 5and have realized how good the word of God is and how mighty are the powers of the coming Age, and then fell away— 6it is impossible, I say, to keep bringing them back to a new repentance, for, to their own undoing, they are repeatedly crucifying the Son of"

Hebrews,6,10,For God is not unjust so that He is unmindful of your labour and of the love which you have manifested towards Himself in having rendered
Hebrews,6,11,"But we long for each of you to continue to manifest the same earnestness, with a view to your enjoying fulness of hope to the very End; 12so that you may not become half-hearted, but be imitators of those who through faith and patient endurance are now heirs to the promises. God’s Unchangeable Promise"
Hebrews,6,13,"For when God gave the promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater to swear by, He swore by Himself, 14saying, “Assuredly I will bless you and bless you, I will increase you and increase you.”"
Hebrews,6,15,"And so, as the result of patient waiting, our forefather obtained what God had promised."
Hebrews,6,16,For men swear by what is greater than themselves; and with them an oath in confirmation of a statement always
Hebrews,6,17,"In the same way, since it was God’s desire to display more convincingly to"
Hebrews,6,18,"He added an oath, in order that, through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for Him to prove false, we may possess mighty encouragement—we who, for safety, have hastened to lay hold of the hope set before us."
Hebrews,6,19,"That hope we have as an anchor of the soul—an anchor that can neither break nor drag. It passes in behind the veil, 20where Jesus has entered as a forerunner on our behalf, having become, like Melchizedek, a High Priest for ever."
Hebrews,7,1,"For this man, Melchizedek, King of Salem and priest of the Most High God—he who when Abraham was returning after defeating the kings met him and pronounced a blessing on him— 2to whom also Abraham presented a tenth part of all—being first, as his name signifies, King of righteousness, and secondly King of Salem, that is, King of peace: 3with no father or mother, and no record of ancestry: having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made a type of the Son of God—this man Melchizedek remains a priest for ever."
Hebrews,7,4,Now think how great this priest-king must have been to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth
Hebrews,7,5,"And those of the descendants of Levi who receive the priesthood are authorized by the Law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brethren, though these have"
Hebrews,7,6,"But, in this instance, one who does not trace his origin from them takes tithes"
Hebrews,7,7,And beyond all
Hebrews,7,8,Moreover here frail mortal men receive
Hebrews,7,9,And Levi too—if I may so speak—pays tithes through Abraham: 10for Levi was yet in the loins of his forefather when Melchizedek met Abraham. A Superior Priesthood
Hebrews,7,11,"Now if the crowning blessing was attainable by means of the Levitical priesthood—for as resting on this foundation the people received the Law, to which they are still subject—what further need was there for a Priest of a different kind to be raised up belonging to the order of Melchizedek instead of"
Hebrews,7,12,"For when the priesthood changes, a change of Law also"
Hebrews,7,13,"He, however, to whom that prophecy refers is associated with a different"
Hebrews,7,14,For it is undeniable that our Lord
Hebrews,7,15,"And this is still more abundantly clear when we read that it is as belonging to the order of Melchizedek that a priest of a different kind is to arise, 16and hold His office not in obedience to any temporary Law, but by virtue of an indestructible Life."
Hebrews,7,17,"For the words are in evidence, “Thou art a priest for ever, belonging to the order of Melchizedek.”"
Hebrews,7,18,On the one hand we have here the abrogation of an earlier code because it was weak and ineffective— 19for the Law brought no perfect blessing—but on the other hand we have the bringing
Hebrews,7,20,"And since it was not without an oath being taken— 21for these men hold office without any oath having been taken, but He holds it attested by an oath from Him who said to Him, “The Lord has sworn and will not recall His words, Thou art a Priest for ever”— 22so much the more also is the Covenant of which Jesus has become the guarantor, a better covenant."
Hebrews,7,23,"And they have been appointed priests many in number, because death prevents their continuance in office: 24but He, because He continues for ever, has a priesthood which does not pass to any successor."
Hebrews,7,25,"Hence too He is able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, seeing that He ever lives to plead for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"Moreover we needed just such a High Priest as this—holy, guileless, undefiled, far removed from sinful men and exalted above the heavens; 27who, unlike other High Priests, is not under the necessity of offering up sacrifices day after day, first for His own sins, and afterwards for those of the people;"
Hebrews,7,28,"For the Law constitutes men High Priests—men with all their infirmity—but the utterance of the oath, which came later than the Law, constitutes High Priest a Son who has been made for ever perfect."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now in connexion with what we have been saying the chief point is that we have a High Priest who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of God’s Majesty in the heavens, 2and ministers in"
Hebrews,8,3,"Every High Priest, however, is appointed to offer both bloodless gifts and sacrifices. Therefore this High Priest also must"
Hebrews,8,4,"If then He were still on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since here there are already those who present the offerings in obedience to the Law, 5and serve a copy and type of the heavenly things, just as Moses was divinely instructed when about to build the tabernacle. For God said, “See that you make everything in imitation of the pattern shown you on the mountain.” The New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:26–40)"
Hebrews,8,6,"But, as a matter of fact, the ministry which Christ has obtained is all the nobler a ministry, in that He is at the same time the negotiator of a sublimer covenant, based upon sublimer promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that first Covenant had been free from imperfection, there would have been no attempt to introduce another."
Hebrews,8,8,"For, being dissatisfied with His people, God says, “’There are days coming,’ says the Lord, ‘When I will establish with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new Covenant— 9a Covenant unlike the one which I made with their forefathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out from the land of Egypt; for they would not remain faithful to that.’ ‘So I turned from them,’ says the Lord."
Hebrews,8,10,"But this is the Covenant that I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days,’ says the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts. And I will indeed be their God and they shall be My People."
Hebrews,8,11,"And there shall be no need for them to teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying, Know the Lord. For all will know Me from the least of them to the greatest;"
Hebrews,8,12,"Because I will be merciful to their wrongdoings, and their sins I will remember no longer.’”"
Hebrews,8,13,"By using the words, “a new Covenant,” He has made the first one obsolete; but whatever is decaying and showing signs of old age is not far from disappearing altogether."
Hebrews,9,1,"Now even the first Covenant had regulations for divine worship, and had also its sanctuary—a"
Hebrews,9,2,"For a sacred tent was constructed—the outer one, in which were"
Hebrews,9,3,And behind the
Hebrews,9,4,"This had a censer of gold, and the ark of the Covenant lined with gold and completely covered with gold, and in it were a gold vase which held the"
Hebrews,9,5,And above the ark were the Cherubim denoting God’s glorious presence and overshadowing the Mercy-seat. But I cannot now speak about all these in detail.
Hebrews,9,6,"These arrangements having long been completed, the priests, when conducting the divine services,"
Hebrews,9,7,"But into the second, the High Priest goes only on one day of the year, and goes alone, taking with him blood, which he offers on his own behalf and on account of the sins"
Hebrews,9,8,And the lesson which the Holy Spirit teaches is this— that the way into the true Holy place is not yet open so long as the outer tent still remains in existence.
Hebrews,9,9,And this is a figure—for the time now present—answering to which both gifts and sacrifices are

Hebrews,9,11,"But Christ appeared as a High Priest of the blessings that are soon to come by means of the greater and more perfect Tent of worship, a tent which has not been built with hands—that is to say does not belong to this material creation— 12and once for all entered the Holy place, taking with Him not the"
Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have contracted defilement make them holy so as to bring about ceremonial purity, 14how much more certainly shall the blood of Christ, who strengthened by the eternal Spirit offered Himself to God, free from blemish, purify your consciences from lifeless works for you to serve the ever-living God?"
Hebrews,9,15,"And because of this He is the negotiator of a new Covenant, in order that, since a life has been given in atonement for the offences committed under the first Covenant, those who have been called may"
Hebrews,9,16,"For where there is a legal ‘will,’"
Hebrews,9,17,"And a will is only of force in the case of a deceased person, being never of any avail so long as he who made it"
Hebrews,9,18,Accordingly we find that the first Covenant was not inaugurated without blood.
Hebrews,9,19,"For when Moses had proclaimed to all the people every commandment contained in the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats and with them water, scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, 20saying, “This is the blood which confirms the Covenant that God has"
Hebrews,9,21,And in the same way he also sprinkled blood upon the Tent of worship and
Hebrews,9,22,"Indeed we may almost say that in obedience to the Law everything is sprinkled with blood, and that apart from the outpouring of blood there is no remission of sins."
Hebrews,9,23,"It was needful therefore that the copies of the things in Heaven should be cleansed in this way, but"
Hebrews,9,24,"For not into a Holy place built by men’s hands—a mere copy of the reality—did Christ enter, but He entered Heaven"
Hebrews,9,25,"Nor did He enter for the purpose of many times offering Himself in sacrifice, just as the High Priest enters the Holy place, year after year, taking"
Hebrews,9,26,"In that case Christ would have needed to suffer many times, from the creation of the world onwards; but as a matter of fact He has appeared once for all, at the Close of"
Hebrews,9,27,"And since it is reserved for all mankind once to die, and afterwards to be judged; 28so the Christ also, having been once offered in sacrifice in order that He might bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, separated from sin, to those who are eagerly expecting Him, to make their salvation complete."
Hebrews,10,1,"For, since the Law exhibits only an outline of the blessings to come and not a perfect representation of the things themselves, the priests can never, by repeating the same sacrifices which they continually"
Hebrews,10,2,"For then would not the sacrifices have ceased to be offered, because the consciences of the worshippers—who in that case"
Hebrews,10,3,But in those
Hebrews,10,4,For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"That is why, when He comes into the world, He says, “Sacrifice and offering Thou has not desired, but a body Thou hast prepared for Me."
Hebrews,10,6,In whole burnt-offerings and in sin-offerings Thou hast taken no pleasure.
Hebrews,10,7,"Then I said, ‘I have come—in the roll of the book it is written concerning Me—to do Thy will, O God.’”"
Hebrews,10,8,"After saying the words I have just quoted, “Sacrifices and offerings or whole burnt-offerings and sin- offerings Thou hast not desired or taken pleasure in”—all such being offered in obedience to the Law—"
Hebrews,10,9,"He then adds, “I have come to do Thy will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the"
Hebrews,10,10,"It is through that divine will that we have been set free from sin, through the offering of Jesus Christ as our sacrifice once for all."
Hebrews,10,11,"And while every priest stands ministering, day after day, and constantly offering the same sacrifices— though such can never rid us of our sins— 12this Priest, on the contrary, after offering for sins a single sacrifice of perpetual efficacy, took His seat at God’s right hand, 13waiting from that time onward until"
Hebrews,10,14,For by a single offering He has for ever completed
Hebrews,10,15,"And the Holy Spirit also gives us His testimony; for when He had said, 16“’This is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days,’ says the Lord: ‘I will put My laws upon their hearts and will write them on their minds;’”"
Hebrews,10,17,"He adds, “And their sins and offences I will remember no longer.”"
Hebrews,10,18,But where these have been forgiven no further offering for sin is required. A Call to Persevere (Jude 1:17–23)
Hebrews,10,19,"Since then, brethren, we have free access to the Holy place through the blood of Jesus, 20by the new and ever-living way which He opened up for us through the rending of the veil—that is to say, of His earthly nature— 21and since we have a great Priest who has authority over the house of God, 22let us draw near with sincerity and unfaltering faith, having had our hearts sprinkled, once for all, from"
Hebrews,10,23,Let us hold firmly to an

Hebrews,10,31,It is an awful thing to fall into the hands of the ever-living God.

Hebrews,10,33,"This was partly through allowing yourselves to be made a public spectacle amid reproaches and persecutions, and partly through coming forward to share the sufferings"

Hebrews,10,35,Therefore do not
Hebrews,10,36,"For you stand in need of patient endurance, so that, as the result of having done the will of God, you may receive the promised blessing."
Hebrews,10,37,For there is still but a short time and then “The coming One will come and will not delay.
Hebrews,10,38,"But it is by faith that My righteous servant shall live; and if he shrinks back, My soul takes no pleasure in him.”"
Hebrews,10,39,"But we are not people who shrink back and perish, but are among those who believe and gain possession of their souls."

Hebrews,11,7,"Through faith Noah, being divinely taught about things as yet unseen, reverently gave heed and built an ark for the safety of his family, and by this act he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which depends on faith.

Hebrews,11,9,"Through faith he came and made his home for a time in a land which had been promised to him, as if in a foreign country, living in tents together with Isaac and Jacob, sharers with him in the same promise; 10for he continually looked forward to the city which has the foundations, whose architect and builder"

Hebrews,11,13,"All these died in the possession of faith. They had not received the promised blessings, but had seen them from a distance and had greeted them, and had acknowledged themselves to be foreigners and strangers here on earth; 14for men who acknowledge this make it manifest that they are seeking"
Hebrews,11,15,"And if they had cherished the remembrance of the country they had left, they would have found an opportunity to return; 16but, as it is, we see them eager for a better land, that is to say, a heavenly one. For this reason God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has now prepared a city for them."

Hebrews,11,32,"And why need I say more? For time will fail me if I tell the story of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, and of David and Samuel and the Prophets; 33men who, as the result of faith, conquered whole kingdoms, brought about true justice, obtained promises from God, stopped lions’ mouths, 34deprived fire of its power, escaped being killed by the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became mighty"

Hebrews,12,1,"Therefore, surrounded as we are by such a vast cloud of witnesses, let us fling aside every encumbrance and the sin that so readily entangles our feet. And let us run with patient endurance the race that lies before us, 2simply fixing our gaze upon Jesus, our Prince Leader in the faith, who will also award us the prize. He, for the sake of the joy which lay before Him, patiently endured the cross, looking with contempt upon its shame, and afterwards seated Himself—where He still sits—at the right hand of the throne of God."
Hebrews,12,3,"Therefore, if you would escape becoming weary and faint-hearted, compare your own sufferings with those of Him who endured such hostility directed against Him by sinners. God Disciplines His Sons"
Hebrews,12,4,"In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted so as to endanger your lives; 5and you have quite forgotten the encouraging words which are addressed to you as sons, and which say, “My son, do not think lightly of the Lord’s discipline, and do not faint when He corrects you; 6for those whom the Lord loves He disciplines: and He scourges every son whom He acknowledges.”"

James,5,12,"But above all things, my brethren, do not swear, either by Heaven or by the earth, or with any other oath. Let your ‘yes’ be simply ‘yes,’ and your ‘no’ be simply ‘no;’ that you may not come under condemnation. The Prayer of Faith"

1 Peter,1,12,"To them it was revealed that they were serving not themselves but you, when they foretold the very things which have now been openly declared to you by those who, having been taught by the Holy Spirit which had been sent from Heaven, brought you the Good News.

1 Peter,2,7,"To you believers, therefore, that honour belongs; but for unbelievers—“A Stone which the builders rejected has been made the Cornerstone,” 8and “a Stone for the foot to strike against, and a Rock to stumble over.” Their foot strikes against it because they are disobedient to God’s Message, and to this they were appointed."

1 Peter,3,3,"Your adornment ought not to be a merely outward thing—one of plaiting the hair, putting on jewelry, or wearing beautiful dresses."
1 Peter,3,4,"Instead of that, it should be a new nature within—the imperishable ornament of a gentle and peaceful"

1 Peter,3,6,"Thus, for instance, Sarah obeyed Abraham, acknowledging his authority over her. And you have become Sarah’s children if you do what is right and permit nothing whatever to terrify you."
1 Peter,3,7,"Married men, in the same way, live with your wives with a clear recognition of the fact that they are weaker than you. Yet, since you are heirs with them of God’s free gift of Life, treat them with honour; so that your prayers may not be hindered. Turning from Evil"
1 Peter,3,8,"In conclusion, all of you should be of one mind, quick to sympathize, kind to the brethren, tenderhearted, lowly-minded, 9not requiting evil with evil nor abuse with abuse, but, on the contrary, giving a blessing in return, because a blessing is what you have been called by God to inherit."

1 Peter,3,17,"For it is better that you should suffer for doing right, if such be God’s will, than for doing evil; 18because Christ also once for all died for sins, the innocent One for the guilty many, in order to bring us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, 19in which He also went and proclaimed His Message to the spirits that were in prison, 20who in ancient times had been disobedient, while God’s longsuffering was patiently waiting in the days of Noah during the building of the Ark, in which a few persons—eight in number—were"
1 Peter,3,21,"And, corresponding to that figure, the water of baptism now saves you—not the washing off of material defilement, but the craving of a good conscience after God— through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22who is at God’s right hand, having gone into Heaven, angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him."

2 Peter,2,7,But when righteous Lot was sore distressed by the gross misconduct of immoral men He rescued him.
2 Peter,2,9,"Since all this is so, the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from temptation, and on the other hand how to keep the unrighteous under punishment in readiness for the Day of Judgement, 10and especially those who are abandoned to sensuality—craving, as they do, for polluted things, and scorning control. Fool-hardy and self-willed, they do not tremble when speaking evil of glorious beings; 11while angels, though greater than they in might and power, do not bring any insulting accusation"
2 Peter,2,12,"But these men, like brute beasts, created (with their natural instincts) 13being doomed to receive a requital for their guilt. They reckon it pleasure to feast daintily in broad daylight. They are spots and blemishes, while feeding luxuriously at their love-feasts, and"

In both my letters I seek to revive in your honest minds the memory of certain things, 2so that you may recall the words spoken long ago by the holy Prophets, and the commandments of our Lord and Saviour given you through your Apostles."
2 Peter,3,3,"But, above all, remember that, in the last days, men will come who make a mock at everything—men governed only by their own passions, 4and, asking, “What has become of His promised Return?

1 John,2,25,And this is the promise which He Himself has given us—the Life of the Ages.
1 John,2,26,I have thus written to you concerning those who are leading you astray.
1 John,2,27,"And as for you, the anointing which you received from Him remains within you, and there is no need for any one to teach you.

1 John,3,11,For this is the Message you have heard from the beginning—that we are to love one another.

Revelation,4,5,"Out from the throne there came flashes of lightning, and voices, and peals of thunder, while in front"
Revelation,4,6,"And in front of the throne there seemed to be a sea of glass, resembling crystal. And midway between the throne and the Elders, and surrounding the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind."
Revelation,4,7,"The first living creature resembled a lion, the second an ox, the third had a face like that of a man,"

Revelation,4,9,"And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who is seated on the throne, and lives until the Ages of the Ages, 10the twenty-four Elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives until the Ages of the Ages, and they cast their wreaths down in front of the throne, 11saying, “It is fitting, O our Lord and God, That we should ascribe unto Thee the glory and the honor and the power; For Thou didst create all things, And because it was Thy will they came into existence, and were created.”"
Revelation,5,1,And I saw lying in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written on both sides and

Revelation,6,1,"And when the Lamb broke one of the seven seals I saw it, and I heard one of the four living creatures"
Revelation,6,2,"And I looked and a white horse appeared, and its rider carried a bow; and a victor’s wreath was given to him; and he went out conquering and in order to conquer. The Second Seal: War"

Revelation,6,7,"When the Lamb broke the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come.”"
Revelation,6,8,"I looked and a pale-colored horse appeared. Its rider’s name was Death, and Hades came close behind him; and authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword or with famine or pestilence or by means of the wild beasts of the earth. The Fifth Seal: The Martyrs"
Revelation,6,9,"When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw at the foot of the altar the souls of those whose lives had"

Revelation,6,15,"The kings of the earth and the great men, the military chiefs, the wealthy and the powerful—all, whether slaves or free men—hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, 16while they called to the mountains and the rocks, saying, “Fall on us and hide us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb; 17for the day of His anger—that great day—has come, and who is able to stand?”"
Revelation,7,1,"After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, and holding back the four winds"
Revelation,7,2,"And I saw another angel coming from the east and carrying a seal belonging to the ever-living God. He called in a loud voice to the four angels whose work it was to injure the earth and the sea. 3“Injure neither land nor sea nor trees,” he said, “until we have sealed the bondservants of our God upon their foreheads.”"

Revelation,7,11,"All the angels were standing in a circle round the throne and round the Elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces in front of the throne and worshipped God. 12“Even so!” they cried: “The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanks and the honor and the power and the might are to be ascribed to our God, until the Ages of the Ages! Even so!”"
Revelation,7,13,"Then, addressing me, one of the Elders said, “Who are these people clothed in the long white robes? And where have they come from?” 14“My lord, you know,” I replied. “They are those,” he said, “who have just passed through the great distress, and have washed their robes and made them white in the"

Revelation,8,5,"So the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and flung it to the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, and voices, and flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. The First Four Trumpets"
Revelation,8,6,Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made preparations for blowing them.
Revelation,8,7,"The first blew his trumpet; and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, falling upon the earth; and a third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third part of the trees and all the green grass."
Revelation,8,8,"The second angel blew his trumpet; and what seemed to be a great mountain, all ablaze with fire,"
Revelation,8,9,And a third part of the creatures that were in the sea—those that had life—died; and a third part of the ships were destroyed.
Revelation,8,10,"The third angel blew his trumpet; and there fell from Heaven a great star, which was on fire like a"
Revelation,8,11,"The name of the star is ‘Wormwood;’ and a third part of the waters were turned into wormwood, and vast numbers of the people died from drinking the water, because it had become bitter."
Revelation,8,12,"Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet; and a curse fell upon a third part of the sun, a third part of the moon, and a third part of the stars, so that a third part of them were darkened and for a third of the day, and also of the night, there was no light."
Revelation,8,13,"Then I looked, and I heard a solitary eagle crying in a loud voice, as it flew across the sky, “Alas, alas, alas, for the inhabitants of the earth, because of the significance of the remaining trumpets which the three angels are about to blow!”"
Revelation,9,1,"The fifth angel blew his trumpet; and I saw a Star which had fallen from Heaven to the earth; and to him was given the key of the depths of the bottomless pit, 2and he opened the depths of the bottomless pit.

Revelation,9,6,"And at that time people will seek death, but will by no possibility find it, and will long to die, but death evades them."
Revelation,9,7,The appearance of the locusts was like that of horses equipped for war. On their heads they had
Revelation,9,8,"Their faces seemed human and they had hair like women’s hair, but"
Revelation,9,9,They had breast-plates which seemed to be made of steel; and the noise caused by their wings was like that of a vast number of horses and chariots hurrying into

Revelation,9,18,"By these three plagues a third part of mankind were destroyed—by the fire and the smoke, and by the"
Revelation,9,19,"For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; their tails being like serpents, and having heads, and it is with them that they inflict injury."
Revelation,9,20,"But the rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues, did not even then repent and leave the things they had made, so as to cease worshipping the demons, and the idols of gold and silver,"
Revelation,9,21,"Nor did they repent of their murders, their practice of magic, their fornication, or their thefts."

Revelation,11,19,"Then the doors of God’s sanctuary in Heaven were opened, and the Ark, in which His Covenant was, was seen in His sanctuary; and there came flashes of lightning, and voices, and peals of thunder, and an earthquake, and heavy hail."
Revelation,12,1,"And a great marvel was seen in Heaven—a woman who was robed with the sun and had the moon under her feet, and had also a wreath of stars round her head, was with child, 2and she was crying out in the pains and agony of childbirth."
Revelation,12,3,"And another marvel was seen in Heaven—a great fiery-red Dragon, with seven heads and ten horns;"
Revelation,12,4,"His tail was drawing after it a third part of the stars of Heaven, and it dashed them to the ground. And in front of the woman who was about to become a mother, the Dragon was standing in order to devour the child as soon as it was born."
Revelation,12,5,"She gave birth to a son—a male child, destined before long to rule all nations with an iron scepter.

Revelation,16,1,"Then I heard a loud voice from the sanctuary say to the seven angels, “Go and pour on to the earth the seven bowls of the anger of God.”"
