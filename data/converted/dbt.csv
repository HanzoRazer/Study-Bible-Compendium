If I should say, I have hope, should I even have a husband to-night, and should I also bear sons, 13would ye wait on that account till they were grown?

Ruth,4,11,"And all the people that were in the gate and the elders said, [We are] witnesses. Jehovah make the woman that cometh into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and acquire power in Ephratah, and make thyself a name in Bethlehem; 12and let thy house become like the house of Pherez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Jehovah shall give thee of this young woman. Boaz Marries Ruth"
Ruth,4,13,"And Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and Jehovah gave her"

Ruth,4,15,"And he shall be to thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age; for thy daughter-in- law who loves thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, has borne him."
Ruth,4,16,"And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it."
Ruth,4,17,"And the women [her] neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi. And they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David. The Line of David (Matthew 1:1–17; Luke 3:23–38)"
Ruth,4,18,"Now these are the generations of Pherez. Pherez begot Hezron, 19and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab, 20and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon, 21and Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed, 22and Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David."

1 Samuel,1,2,"And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
1 Samuel,1,3,And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts
1 Samuel,1,4,"And it came to pass on the day that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions; 5but to Hannah he used to give a double portion, for he loved Hannah; but"

1 Samuel,2,7,"Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich, he bringeth low, also he lifteth up:"
1 Samuel,2,8,"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, To set [him] among nobles; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory; For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah’s, and he hath set the world upon them."
1 Samuel,2,9,"He keepeth the feet of his saints, but the wicked are silenced in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail."
1 Samuel,2,10,"They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; in the heavens will he thunder upon them. Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed."
1 Samuel,2,11,And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the boy ministered to Jehovah in the presence of Eli the priest. Eli’s Wicked Sons
1 Samuel,2,12,Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not Jehovah.
1 Samuel,2,13,"And the priests’ custom with the people was, when any man sacrificed a sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, when the flesh was cooked, with a flesh-hook of three prongs in his hand; 14and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; the priest took of it all that the flesh-hook brought up. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites"
1 Samuel,2,15,"Even before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he will not accept sodden flesh of thee, but raw."
1 Samuel,2,16,"If the man said to him, They will immediately burn the fat entire, then take as thy soul desires; he"

1 Samuel,2,20,"And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to Jehovah. And they went to their own home."
1 Samuel,2,21,"So Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before Jehovah."
1 Samuel,2,22,"And Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and that they lay with the"

1 Samuel,2,26,"And the boy Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men. A Prophecy against the House of Eli"
1 Samuel,2,27,"And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Did I plainly reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt, in Pharaoh’s house, 28and choose him out of all the tribes of Israel, to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear the ephod before me? and I gave unto the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel."
1 Samuel,2,29,"Wherefore do ye trample upon my sacrifice and upon mine oblation which I have commanded [in my] habitation? And thou honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the primest of all"
1 Samuel,2,30,"Wherefore Jehovah the God of Israel saith, I said indeed, Thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever. But now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed."

1 Samuel,2,35,"And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, [who] shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed"
1 Samuel,2,36,"And it shall come to pass [that] every one that is left of thy house shall come to crouch to him for a small piece of silver and for a cake of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread."
1 Samuel,3,1,And the boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was rare in those days; a vision was not frequent.
1 Samuel,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli lay in his place (now his eyes began to grow dim, he could not see), 3and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah, where"

1 Samuel,3,9,"And Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
1 Samuel,3,10,"And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at the other times, Samuel, Samuel! And Samuel said,"
1 Samuel,3,11,"And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I do a thing in Israel, at which"
1 Samuel,3,12,In that day I will perform against Eli all that I

1 Samuel,3,14,And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice or oblation for ever. Samuel Shares the Vision
1 Samuel,3,15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared"
1 Samuel,3,16,"And Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am"
1 Samuel,3,17,"And he said, What is the word that he has spoken to thee? I pray thee, keep it not back from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou keep back anything from me of all the word that he spoke"
1 Samuel,3,18,"And Samuel told him all the words, and kept nothing back from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what is good in his sight."
1 Samuel,3,19,"And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground."
1 Samuel,3,20,And all
1 Samuel,3,21,And Jehovah appeared again at Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.
1 Samuel,4,1,"And what Samuel had said happened to all Israel. And Israel went out against the Philistines to battle,"
1 Samuel,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and the battle spread, and Israel was routed before the Philistines;"
1 Samuel,4,3,"And the people came into the camp; and the elders of Israel said, Why has Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch ourselves the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh, that it may come among us, and save"
1 Samuel,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth between the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there by the ark of the covenant of God."

1 Samuel,15,22,"And Samuel said, Has Jehovah delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, As in hearkening to the voice of Jehovah? Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice, Attention than the fat of rams."
1 Samuel,15,23,"For rebellion is [as] the sin of divination, And selfwill is [as] iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, He hath also rejected thee from being king. Saul’s Confession"

1 Samuel,15,33,"And Samuel said, As thy sword has made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless above women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,34,And Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel,15,35,And Samuel saw Saul no more until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned over Saul; and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
1 Samuel,16,1,"And Jehovah said to Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have"

1 Samuel,16,12,"And he sent and brought him in. And he was ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance and beautiful"
1 Samuel,16,13,"And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren. And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. David Serves Saul"

1 Samuel,17,15,But David went
1 Samuel,17,16,"And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days."
1 Samuel,17,17,"And Jesse said to David his son, Take, I pray, for thy brethren, this ephah of parched [corn] and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to thy brethren; 18and carry these ten cheeses to the captain of the thousand, and visit thy brethren to see how they are, and take a pledge of them."
1 Samuel,17,19,"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel [were] in the valley of terebinths, fighting against the Philistines."

1 Samuel,17,41,And the Philistine came on and approached David; and the man that bore the shield was before him.
1 Samuel,17,42,"And when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he disdained him; for he was a youth, and"

1 Samuel,18,5,"And David went forth; whithersoever Saul sent him he prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants."
1 Samuel,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tambours, with joy, and with triangles."
1 Samuel,18,7,"And the women answered [one another] as they played, and said, Saul hath smitten his thousands, And David his ten thousands."

1 Samuel,18,13,"And Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in"
1 Samuel,18,14,And David prospered in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him.

2 Samuel,12,2,"The rich had very many flocks and herds; 3but the poor man had nothing at all, but one little ewe lamb which he had bought, and was nourishing; and it grew up with him, and together with his children: it ate of his morsel, and drank of his own cup, and slept in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter."
2 Samuel,12,4,"And there came a traveller to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that had come to him; and he took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that had come to him."

2 Samuel,13,37,"And Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned"
2 Samuel,13,38,"Now Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years."
2 Samuel,13,39,"And king David longed to go forth to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead."
2 Samuel,14,1,And Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.
2 Samuel,14,2,"And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said to her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning garments, I pray, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead; 3and come to the king, and speak after this manner to him.

2 Samuel,14,12,"And the woman said, Let thy bondmaid, I pray thee, speak a word to my lord the king. And he said,"
2 Samuel,14,13,"And the woman said, Why then hast thou thought such a thing against God’s people? and the king in saying this thing, is as one guilty, in that the king does not bring back his banished one."
2 Samuel,14,14,"For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; and God has not taken away his life, but devises means that the banished one be not expelled from"

2 Samuel,14,19,"And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, [As] thy soul liveth, my lord, O king, there is no turning to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king has spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words into the mouth of thy bondmaid: 20in order to turn the appearance of the thing has thy servant Joab done this thing; but my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all that is in the earth."
2 Samuel,14,21,"And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: so go, bring back the young man"

2 Samuel,14,29,"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him; and he sent again the second time,"
2 Samuel,14,30,"Then he said to his servants, See, Joab’s allotment is near mine and he has"
2 Samuel,14,31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to [his] house, and said to him, Why have thy servants set my allotment on fire?"
2 Samuel,14,32,"And Absalom said to Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it would have been better for me to be there still. And now"
2 Samuel,14,33,"And Joab came to the king, and told him. And he called Absalom, and he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom."

1 Kings,4,20,"Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry."
1 Kings,4,21,"And Solomon ruled over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life."
1 Kings,4,22,"And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal, 23ten fatted oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and"

1 Kings,4,30,"And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the sons of the east,"
1 Kings,4,31,"For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman,"
1 Kings,4,32,And he
1 Kings,4,33,"And he spoke of the trees, from the cedar-tree that is on Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also"
1 Kings,4,34,"And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom."
1 Kings,5,1,And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him
1 Kings,5,2,"And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,"
1 Kings,5,3,"Thou knowest that David my father could not build a house unto the name of Jehovah his God, because of the wars which were about him on every side, until Jehovah put them under the soles of"
1 Kings,5,4,But now Jehovah my God has given me rest on every side: there is neither adversary nor evil
1 Kings,5,5,"And behold, I purpose to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah spoke to David my father saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy stead, he shall build a house"
1 Kings,5,6,And now command that they hew me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say; for thou knowest that there is not among us any that are experienced in cutting timber like to the Zidonians. Hiram’s Reply to Solomon (2 Chronicles 2:11–18)
1 Kings,5,7,"And it came to pass when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said,"
1 Kings,5,8,"And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard the things which thou sentest to me for: I will do all thy desire"
1 Kings,5,9,"My servants shall bring [them] down from Lebanon to the sea; and I will convey them by sea [in] rafts to the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them. And thou shalt accomplish"
1 Kings,5,10,So Hiram gave Solomon cedar-trees and cypress-trees
1 Kings,5,11,And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat as food
1 Kings,5,12,And Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league. Solomon’s Labor Force
1 Kings,5,13,And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
1 Kings,5,14,"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, two months"
1 Kings,5,15,"And Solomon had seventy thousand that bore burdens, and eighty thousand stone-masons in the mountains; 16besides the overseers whom Solomon had set over the work, three thousand three hundred, who ruled over the people that wrought in the work."
1 Kings,5,17,"And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, hewn stones, to lay the"
1 Kings,5,18,"And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Giblites hewed them, and prepared timber and stones to build the house."
1 Kings,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the"
1 Kings,6,2,And the house that king Solomon built
1 Kings,6,3,"And the porch, in front of the temple of the house, was twenty cubits in length, in front of the house broadways,"
1 Kings,6,4,And for the house he made closed windows with fixed lattices. The Chambers
1 Kings,6,5,"And against the wall of the house he built floors round about, [against] the walls of the house, round"
1 Kings,6,6,"The lowest floor was five cubits broad, and the middle one was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for in the [thickness of the wall of] the house he made resets round about outside, that nothing should be fastened in the walls of the house."
1 Kings,6,7,"And the house, when it was being built, was built of stone entirely made ready before it was brought thither; so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was being built."
1 Kings,6,8,The entrance to the side-chambers of the middle [floor] was in the right side of the house; and they

1 Kings,6,10,"And he built the floors against all the house, five cubits high; and they held to the house by the timbers of cedar. God’s Promise to Solomon"
1 Kings,6,11,"And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon saying,"
1 Kings,6,12,"As to this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and practise mine ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them, then will I perform my word as to thee which I spoke unto David thy father; 13and I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel. The Temple’s Interior (2 Chronicles 3:5–9)"
1 Kings,6,14,And Solomon built the house and finished it.
1 Kings,6,15,"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, from the floor of the house to the walls of the roof; he overlaid [them] on the inside with wood, and overlaid the floor of the house with"
1 Kings,6,16,"And he built twenty cubits of the innermost part of the house, both floor and walls, with boards of cedar; and he built [them] for it within, to [be] the oracle, the most holy place."
1 Kings,6,17,"And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits [long]."
1 Kings,6,18,And the cedar of the house within was carved with colocynths and half-open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
1 Kings,6,19,"And he prepared the oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of"
1 Kings,6,20,"And the oracle within was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold; and he overlaid the cedar-wood altar— 21and Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold, and shut off the oracle in front with chains of"
1 Kings,6,22,"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, the whole house entirely; also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold. The Cherubim (2 Chronicles 3:10–13)"
1 Kings,6,23,"And he made in the oracle two cherubim of olive-wood, ten cubits high; 24and one wing of the cherub was five cubits, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub, ten cubits from the end of one wing to the end of the other wing; 25and the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one"
1 Kings,6,26,"The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so of the other cherub."
1 Kings,6,27,"And he set the cherubim in the midst of the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched"
1 Kings,6,28,And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1 Kings,6,29,"And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved sculptures of cherubim, and palm-"
1 Kings,6,30,"And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. The Doors"
1 Kings,6,31,And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood: the lintel [and] side posts were the
1 Kings,6,32,"The two doors were of olive-wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim, and palm-trees and half-open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm-trees."

1 Kings,6,36,"And he built the inner court of three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar-beams."
1 Kings,6,37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Jehovah laid, in the month Zif; 38and in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished in all its parts, and according to all the fashion of it. So he was seven years in building it."
1 Kings,7,1,And Solomon was thirteen years building his own house; and he finished all his house.
1 Kings,7,2,"And he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was a hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar-pillars, with cedar-beams upon the pillars; 3and it was covered with cedar above upon the side-chambers, which were on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row."
1 Kings,7,4,"And there were cross-beams in three rows, and window was against window in three ranks."
1 Kings,7,5,"And all the doors and posts were square, with an architrave; and window was against window in three ranks."
1 Kings,7,6,"And he made the porch of pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; and there was a porch in front of them; and there were pillars, and steps in front of them."
1 Kings,7,7,"And he made the porch for the throne where he judged, the porch of judgment; and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor."
1 Kings,7,8,"And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. And he made, like to this porch, a house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Solomon had taken."
1 Kings,7,9,"All these [buildings] were of costly stones, hewn stones, according to the measures, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation to the coping, and on the outside as far as the great court."
1 Kings,7,10,"And the foundations were of costly stones, great stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight"
1 Kings,7,11,"And above were costly stones, hewn stones, according to the measures, and cedar."
1 Kings,7,12,"And the great court round about had three rows of hewn stones, and a row of cedar-beams; and so it was for the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and the porch of the house. The Pillars and Capitals (2 Chronicles 3:14–17)"
1 Kings,7,13,And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
1 Kings,7,14,"He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was full of wisdom and understanding and knowledge, to do all kinds of works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and made all his work."
1 Kings,7,15,"And he formed the two pillars of brass; the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a line of"
1 Kings,7,16,"And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits; 17[and] nets of checker-work, wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon"

1 Kings,7,22,And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work; and the work of the pillars was finished. The Molten Sea (2 Chronicles 4:1–5)
1 Kings,7,23,"And he made the sea, molten, ten cubits from brim to brim, round all about; and its height was five"
1 Kings,7,24,"And under the brim of it round about there were colocynths, encompassing it, ten in a cubit enclosing the sea round about; two rows of"
1 Kings,7,25,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east;"
1 Kings,7,26,"And its thickness was a hand-breadth, and its brim was like the work of the brim of a cup, with lily-blossoms; it held two thousand baths. The Ten Bronze Stands"
1 Kings,7,27,"And he made ten bases of brass: four cubits was the length of one base, and the breadth four cubits,"
1 Kings,7,28,"And the work of the bases was this: they had panels, and the panels"
1 Kings,7,29,"And on the panels that were between the fillets were lions, oxen and cherubim; and over the fillets there was a base above; and beneath the lions and oxen were garlands"
1 Kings,7,30,"And every base had four wheels of brass, and axles of brass; and on its four corners"
1 Kings,7,31,"And the mouth of it within the crown and above was a cubit; and its mouth was rounded, [as] the work of the base, a cubit and a half; and also upon its mouth was sculpture; but their panels were square, not"
1 Kings,7,32,And the four wheels were under the panels; and the supports of the wheels were in the base;
1 Kings,7,33,"And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their supports, and their rims, and their spokes and their naves were all molten."
1 Kings,7,34,And there were four shoulder-pieces to the four corners of one base; of the base itself were its
1 Kings,7,35,And in the top of the base there was a circular elevation of half a cubit round about;
1 Kings,7,36,"And he engraved on the plates of its stays and on its panels cherubim, lions and palm-trees, according to the space upon each; and"
1 Kings,7,37,"After this [manner] he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, one form. The Ten Bronze Basins (2 Chronicles 4:6–8)"
1 Kings,7,38,And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; every laver was four cubits; upon
1 Kings,7,39,"And he put the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, over against the south. Completion of the Bronze Works (2 Chronicles 4:11–18)"
1 Kings,7,40,"And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the bowls. So Hiram ended doing all the work that he made for king Solomon [for] the house of Jehovah: 41two pillars, and the globes of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, two; and the two networks, to cover the two globes of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; 42and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two globes of the capitals which were upon the pillars; 43and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases; 44and one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea; 45and the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls. And all these things, which Hiram made king"

1 Kings,7,48,"And Solomon made all the vessels that were [in] the house of Jehovah: the golden altar; and the table of gold, whereon was the shewbread; 49and the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right, and five on the left, before the oracle; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold, 50and the basons, and the knives, and the bowls, and the cups, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, for the folding-doors of the inner house, the most holy place, [and] for the doors of the house, of the temple."
1 Kings,7,51,And all the work was finished that king Solomon made for the house of Jehovah. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated; the silver and the gold and the vessels he put among the treasures of the house of Jehovah.
1 Kings,8,1,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah"
1 Kings,8,2,And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon
1 Kings,8,3,And all the elders of Israel came; and

1 Kings,8,5,"And king Solomon, and all the assembly of Israel that were assembled to him, [who were] with him before the ark,"
1 Kings,8,6,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim; 7for the cherubim stretched forth [their] wings over the"
1 Kings,8,8,"And the staves were long, so that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle, but they were not seen"
1 Kings,8,9,"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses placed there at Horeb, when Jehovah made [a covenant] with the children of Israel, when"
1 Kings,8,10,"And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah, 11and the priests could not stand to do their service because of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of Jehovah. Solomon Blesses the LORD (2 Chronicles 6:1–11)"
1 Kings,8,12,Then said Solomon: Jehovah said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
1 Kings,8,13,"I have indeed built a house of habitation for thee, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever."

1 Kings,8,22,"And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of the whole congregation of Israel,"
1 Kings,8,23,"And he said, Jehovah, God of Israel! there is no God like thee, in the heavens above, or on the earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart; 24who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him; thou spokest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled [it] with thy hand,"
1 Kings,8,25,"And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of"
1 Kings,8,26,"And now, O God of Israel, let thy words, I pray thee, be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David my father."
1 Kings,8,27,"But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens, and the heaven of heavens, cannot"
1 Kings,8,28,"Yet have respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, Jehovah, my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day; 29that thine eyes may be open upon this house night and day, upon the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: to hearken unto the prayer which"
1 Kings,8,30,"And hearken unto the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place, and hear thou in thy dwelling-place, in the heavens, and when thou hearest, forgive."
1 Kings,8,31,"If a man have sinned against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to adjure him, and the oath come before thine altar in this house; 32then hear thou in the heavens, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, giving him according to his righteousness."
1 Kings,8,33,"When thy people Israel are put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house; 34then hear thou in the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land that thou gavest unto their fathers."
1 Kings,8,35,"When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, because thou hast afflicted them; 36then hear thou in the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance."
1 Kings,8,37,"If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blight, mildew, locust, caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their gates; whatever plague, whatever sickness there be: 38what prayer, what supplication soever be made by any man, of all thy people Israel, when they shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house; 39then hear thou in the heavens, the settled place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest (for thou, thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men), 40that they may fear thee all the days that they live upon the land which thou gavest unto our fathers."
1 Kings,8,41,"And as to the stranger also, who is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name’s sake 42(for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thy stretched- out arm); when he shall come and pray toward this house, 43hear thou in the heavens thy dwelling- place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; in order that all peoples of the earth may know thy name, [and] that they may fear thee as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name."
1 Kings,8,44,"If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray to Jehovah toward the city that thou hast chosen, and the house that I have built unto thy name; 45then hear thou in the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their right."
1 Kings,8,46,"If they have sinned against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and give them up to the enemy, and they have carried them away captives unto the enemy’s land, far or near; 47and if they shall take it to heart in the land whither they were carried captive, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done iniquity, we have dealt perversely; 48and if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies who led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city that thou hast chosen, and the house that I have built unto thy name; 49then hear thou in the heavens, the settled place of thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their right; 50and forgive thy people their sin against thee, and all their transgressions whereby they have transgressed against thee, and give them to find compassion with those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them 51(for they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron)— 52thine eyes being open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto"
1 Kings,8,53,"For thou hast separated them from among all peoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spokest through Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah. Solomon’s Benediction"
1 Kings,8,54,"And it was so, that when Solomon had ended praying all this prayer and supplication to Jehovah, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth to the heavens, 55and he stood and blessed the whole congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,"
1 Kings,8,56,"Blessed be Jehovah, who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there"

Nehemiah,9,28,"But when they had rest, they did evil again before thee; and thou didst leave them in the hand of their enemies, and they had dominion over them; and again they cried unto thee, and thou heardest [them] from the heavens, and many times didst thou deliver them, according to thy mercies."
Nehemiah,9,29,"And thou testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law; but they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances (which if a man do, he shall live in them); and they withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."

Nehemiah,9,32,"And now, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and loving- kindness, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the days of the kings of Assyria unto this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"But thou art just in all that is come upon us; for thou hast acted according to truth, and we have done wickedly."
Nehemiah,9,34,"And our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers, have not performed thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"And they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land that thou didst set before them, neither turned they from their wicked works."

Esther,1,1,"And it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (that is, the Ahasuerus that reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces), 2in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the fortress, 3in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and the princes of the provinces being before him; 4when he shewed the glorious wealth of his kingdom and the splendid magnificence of his grandeur many days, a hundred and eighty days."

Esther,1,9,Also the queen Vashti made a feast for the women of the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the king’s heart was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of king Ahasuerus, 11to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown to shew the peoples"

Esther,1,16,"Then said Memucan before the king and the princes, The queen Vashti has not done wrong to the king only, but"
Esther,1,17,"For the act of the queen will come abroad to all women, so as to render their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when they shall say, The king Ahasuerus commanded the queen Vashti to be brought in"
Esther,1,18,And the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s
Esther,1,19,"If it please the king, let a royal order go forth from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it may not pass, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another that is better than she; 20and when the king’s edict which he shall make shall be heard throughout his realm—for it is great—all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, from the greatest to the least."
Esther,1,21,And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan.
Esther,1,22,"And he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people according to their language, That every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people."
Esther,2,1,"After these things, when the fury of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what"
Esther,2,2,"Then said the king’s servants that attended upon him, Let there be maidens, virgins of beautiful countenance, sought for the king; 3and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the young virgins of beautiful countenance to Shushan the fortress, to the house of the women, unto the custody of"
Esther,2,4,And let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so. Esther Finds Favor
Esther,2,5,"There was in Shushan the fortress a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite, 6who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon"
Esther,2,7,"And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother—and the maiden was fair and beautiful—and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter."
Esther,2,8,"And it came to pass when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the fortress, unto the custody of Hegai, that Esther"
Esther,2,9,"And the maiden pleased him, and obtained favour before him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, and her portions, and the seven maidens selected to be given her, out of the king’s house;"
Esther,2,10,Esther had not made known her people nor her birth; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.
Esther,2,11,"And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her."
Esther,2,12,"And when every maiden’s turn came to go in to king Ahasuerus after that she had been treated for twelve months, according to the manner of the women (for so were the days of their purification accomplished—six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices, and with things for the purifying of the women, 13and thus came the maiden in unto the king), whatever she desired was"
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, unto the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she were called by name."
Esther,2,15,"And when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain,"
Esther,2,16,"So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus, into his royal house, in the tenth month, that is, the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. Esther Becomes Queen"
Esther,2,17,"And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins, and he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti."
Esther,2,18,"And the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave presents according to the king’s bounty."
Esther,2,19,"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai sat in the king’s gate. 20(Esther, as Mordecai had charged her, had not yet made known her birth nor her people; for Esther did what Mordecai told her, like as when she was brought up with him.) Mordecai Uncovers a Conspiracy"
Esther,2,21,"In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus."
Esther,2,22,"And the thing became known to Mordecai, and he related it to Esther the queen, and Esther told it"
Esther,2,23,And the matter was investigated and found out; and they were both hanged on a tree. And it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
Esther,3,1,"After these things king Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and"
Esther,3,2,"And all the king’s servants that were in the king’s gate bowed and did Haman reverence, for the king had so commanded"
Esther,3,3,"Then the king’s servants, who"
Esther,3,4,"And it came to pass as they spoke daily to him, and he hearkened not to them, that they informed Haman,"
Esther,3,5,And when
Esther,3,6,But he scorned to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai; therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus—the people of Mordecai.
Esther,3,7,"In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman for each day and for each month, to the twelfth [month], that is, the month"
Esther,3,8,"And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from [those of] every people,"
Esther,3,9,"If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the"
Esther,3,10,"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’"
Esther,3,11,"And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as seems good to thee."
Esther,3,12,"Then were the king’s scribes called, in the first month, on the thirteenth day of the [month], and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors over every province, and to the princes of every people; to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people according to their language: in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written,"
Esther,3,13,"And the letters were sent by couriers into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, upon the thirteenth of the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, and [to take] the spoil of them"
Esther,3,14,"That the decree might be given in every province, a copy of the writing was published to"
Esther,3,15,"The couriers went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the fortress. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was in consternation."
Esther,4,1,"And when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his garments, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and bitter cry, 2and came even"
Esther,4,3,"And in every province, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing: many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,"And Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told [it] her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him; but he"
Esther,4,5,"Then Esther called for Hatach, [one] of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to wait upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why"
Esther,4,6,"And Hatach went forth to Mordecai, unto the public place of the city which was before the"
Esther,4,7,"And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and of the sum of money that"
Esther,4,8,"And he gave him a copy of the writing of the decree that had been given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew [it] to Esther, and to declare [it] to her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people."
Esther,4,9,And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther,4,10,"And Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave"
Esther,4,11,"All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces do know that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law, to put [him] to death, except [such] to whom the king shall hold out the golden"
Esther,4,12,And they told Mordecai Esther’s words.
Esther,4,13,And Mordecai bade to answer Esther: Imagine not in thy heart that thou shalt escape in the king’s
Esther,4,14,"For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there arise relief and deliverance to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall perish. And who knows whether thou art [not] come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
Esther,4,15,And Esther bade to answer Mordecai:
Esther,4,16,"Go, gather together all the Jews that are found in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise, and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish."
Esther,4,17,"And Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."
Esther,5,1,"And it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house. And the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal"
Esther,5,2,"And it was so, when the king saw the queen Esther standing in the court, that she obtained grace in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden"

Esther,5,4,"And Esther said, If it seem good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him."
Esther,5,5,"And the king said, Hasten Haman, that it may be done as Esther has said. And the king and Haman"
Esther,5,6,"And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee; and what is thy request? even to the half of the"
Esther,5,7,"And Esther answered and said, My petition and my request is,"
Esther,5,8,"If I have found grace in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to- morrow according to the king’s word. Haman’s Plot against Mordecai"
Esther,5,9,And Haman went forth that day joyful and glad of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s
Esther,5,10,But Haman
Esther,5,11,"And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all wherein the king"
Esther,5,12,"And Haman said, Yea, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had"
Esther,5,13,Yet all this is of no avail
Esther,5,14,"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends to him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king that Mordecai may be hanged on it: then go in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made."
Esther,6,1,On that night sleep fled from the king. And he commanded to bring the book of records of the

Esther,6,7,"And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honour, 8let the royal apparel be brought with which the king arrays himself, and the horse that the king rides upon, and on the head of which the royal crown is set; 9and let the apparel and horse be delivered into the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, and let them array the man whom the king delights to honour, and cause him to ride on the horse through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honour!"
Esther,6,10,"And the king said to Haman, Make haste, take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do"
Esther,6,11,"And Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honour!"
Esther,6,12,"And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having"
Esther,6,13,"And Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and to all his friends all that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife to him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but wilt certainly fall before him."
Esther,6,14,"While they were yet talking with him, the king’s chamberlains came, and hasted to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,And the king and Haman came to drink with Esther the queen.
Esther,7,2,"And the king said again to Esther on the second day, at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted"
Esther,7,3,"And Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found grace in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request; 4for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had"
Esther,7,5,And king Ahasuerus
Esther,7,6,"And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen. The Hanging of Haman"
Esther,7,7,"And the king in his wrath rose up from the banquet of wine, [and went] into the palace garden; but Haman stayed to make request for his life to Esther the queen, for he saw that there was evil"
Esther,7,8,"And the king returned out of the palace garden into the house of the banquet of wine, and Haman was fallen upon the couch on which Esther was. And the king said, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? The word went forth out of the king’s mouth,"
Esther,7,9,"And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold, also, the gallows fifty cubits high, that Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, stands"
Esther,7,10,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. And the king’s wrath was appeased.
Esther,8,1,On that day did king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews’ oppressor to Esther the queen.
Esther,8,2,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
Esther,8,3,"And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device which he had devised against the Jews."
Esther,8,4,"And the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. And Esther arose and stood before the king, 5and said, If it please the king and if I have found grace before him, and the thing seem right to the king, and I be pleasing in his sight, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of"

Esther,8,7,"And king Ahasuerus said to queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he stretched forth his hand against the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"Write ye then for the Jews as seems good to you, in the king’s name, and seal [it] with the king’s ring. For a writing that is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, cannot be reversed."
Esther,8,9,"Then were the king’s scribes called at that time, in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth [day] thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors, and the princes of the provinces which are from India even to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people according to their language, and to the Jews according to their writing"

Esther,8,16,"The Jews had light, and joy, and gladness, and honour."
Esther,8,17,"And in every province, and in every city, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them."
Esther,9,1,"And in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day thereof, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them (but it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had power over them that hated them), 2the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout the provinces of king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt. And no man could withstand them; for"
Esther,9,3,"And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors and officers of the king, helped the Jews; for the fear of Mordecai had fallen upon"
Esther,9,4,"For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went forth throughout the provinces;"
Esther,9,5,"And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction, and did what they would to those that hated them."
Esther,9,6,And in Shushan the fortress the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
Esther,9,7,"And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, 8and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, 9and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha, 10the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the oppressor of the Jews, they slew; but they laid not their hands on the prey. Haman’s Sons Hanged"
Esther,9,11,On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the fortress was brought before the king.
Esther,9,12,"And the king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the fortress, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? And what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee; and what is thy request further? and"
Esther,9,13,"And Esther said, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according to this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the"
Esther,9,14,And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they
Esther,9,15,"And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but they laid not their hand on the prey."
Esther,9,16,"And the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their life, and had rest from their enemies; and they slew of them that hated them seventy-five thousand (but they laid not their hand on the prey), 17on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and joy. The Feast of Purim Instituted"
Esther,9,18,"But the Jews that were at Shushan gathered themselves together on the thirteenth [day] thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth of the same they rested, and made it a day of"
Esther,9,19,"Therefore the Jews of the villages that dwell in the country towns make the fourteenth of the month Adar a day of joy and feasting, and a good day, and on which they send portions one to another."
Esther,9,20,"And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews near and far that were in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, 21to establish [this] among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, 22as the days on which the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month that was turned to them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor."
Esther,9,23,"And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them."
Esther,9,24,"For Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the oppressor of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them and to destroy them; 25and when [Esther] came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head; and they hanged him and his sons on the gallows."
Esther,9,26,"Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore, according to all the words of this letter, and for what they had seen concerning this matter and what had happened to them, 27the Jews ordained and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail, that they would observe these two days according to their writing and according to their fixed time, every year; 28and that these days should be remembered and observed throughout every generation, in every family, every province, and every city, and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them cease from among their seed."
Esther,9,29,"And queen Esther the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm"
Esther,9,30,"And he sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, words of peace and truth, 31to confirm these days of Purim in their fixed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and queen Esther had enjoined them, and as they had"
Esther,9,32,And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
Esther,10,1,And king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land and the isles of the sea.
Esther,10,2,"And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him,"
Esther,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew was second to king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the welfare of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed."
Job,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and this man was perfect and upright, and"
Job,1,2,And there were born to him seven sons and three
Job,1,3,"And his substance was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and very many servants; and this man was greater"
Job,1,4,And his sons went and made a feast in the house of each one on his
Job,1,5,"And it was so, when the days of the feasting were gone about, that Job sent and hallowed them; and he rose up early in the morning, and offered up burnt-offerings [according to] the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. Satan’s First Attack"
Job,1,6,And there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah; and Satan
Job,1,7,"And Jehovah said to Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan answered"
Job,1,8,"And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth,"
Job,1,9,And Satan answered
Job,1,10,"Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his"
Job,1,11,"But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath, [and"
Job,1,12,"And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah. Job Loses His Children and Possessions"
Job,1,13,And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of
Job,1,14,"And there came a messenger to Job and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them; 15and [they of] Sheba fell [upon them] and took them, and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee."
Job,1,16,"While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The fire of God fell from heaven and burned"
Job,1,17,"While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels and took them, and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword; and I only"
Job,1,18,"While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn; 19and behold, there came a great wind from over the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they died; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee."
Job,1,20,"And Job rose up, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped; 21and he said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah!"
Job,1,22,"In all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed anything unseemly to God."
Job,2,1,"And there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan"
Job,2,2,"And Jehovah said to Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from"
Job,2,3,"And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and abstaineth from evil? and still he remaineth firm in his integrity, though thou movedst me against him, to swallow"
Job,2,4,"And Satan answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life; 5but put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, [and see] if he"
Job,2,6,"And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life."
Job,2,7,And Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah; and he smote Job with a grievous botch from
Job,2,8,And he took a potsherd to scrape himself with; and he sat among the ashes.
Job,2,9,"And his wife said to him, Dost thou still remain firm in thine integrity? curse God and die."
Job,2,10,"But he said to her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. We have also received good from God, and should we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips. Job’s Three Friends"
Job,2,11,"And three friends of Job heard of all this evil that was come upon him. And they came each one from his place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made"
Job,2,12,"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice and wept. And they rent every one his"
Job,2,13,And they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights; and none spoke a word to him; for they saw that [his] anguish was very great.
Job,3,1,"After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day."
Job,3,2,"And Job answered and said,"
Job,3,3,"Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night that said, There is a man child conceived."
Job,3,4,"That day—let it be darkness, let not +God care for it from above, neither let light shine upon it:"
Job,3,5,Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it; let clouds dwell upon it; let darkeners of the day terrify it.
Job,3,6,That night—let gloom seize upon it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
Job,3,7,"Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful sound come therein;"
Job,3,8,"Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse Leviathan;"
Job,3,9,"Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it wait for light, and have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the dawn:"
Job,3,10,"Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, and hid not trouble from mine eyes."
Job,3,11,"Wherefore did I not die from the womb,—come forth from the belly and expire?"
Job,3,12,"Why did the knees meet me? and wherefore the breasts, that I should suck?"
Job,3,13,"For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept: then had I been at rest,"
Job,3,14,"With kings and counsellors of the earth, who build desolate places for themselves,"
Job,3,15,"Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver;"
Job,3,16,Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants that have not seen the light.
Job,3,17,There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the wearied are at rest.
Job,3,18,The prisoners together are at ease; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
Job,3,19,"The small and great are there, and the bondman freed from his master."
Job,3,20,"Wherefore is light given to him that is in trouble, and life to those bitter of soul,"
Job,3,21,"Who long for death, and it [cometh] not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures;"
Job,3,22,Who rejoice even exultingly and are glad when they find the grave?—
Job,3,23,"To the man whose way is hidden, and whom +God hath hedged in?"
Job,3,24,"For my sighing cometh before my bread, and my groanings are poured out like the waters."
Job,3,25,"For I feared a fear, and it hath come upon me, and that which I dreaded hath come to me."
Job,3,26,"I was not in safety, neither had I quietness, neither was I at rest, and trouble came."
Job,4,1,"And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,"
Job,4,2,"If a word were essayed to thee, wouldest thou be grieved? But who can refrain from speaking?"
Job,4,3,"Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands;"
Job,4,4,"Thy words have upholden him that was stumbling, and thou hast braced up the bending knees:"
Job,4,5,"But now it is come upon thee, and thou grievest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled."
Job,4,6,"Hath not thy piety been thy confidence, and the perfection of thy ways thy hope?"
Job,4,7,"Remember, I pray thee, who that was innocent has perished? and where were the upright cut off?"
Job,4,8,"Even as I have seen, they that plough iniquity and sow mischief, reap the same."
Job,4,9,"By the breath of +God they perish, and by the blast of his nostrils are they consumed."
Job,4,10,"The roar of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken;"
Job,4,11,"The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered."
Job,4,12,"Now to me a word was secretly brought, and mine ear received a whisper thereof."
Job,4,13,"In thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men:—"
Job,4,14,"Fear came on me, and trembling, and made all my bones to shake;"
Job,4,15,And a spirit passed before my face—the hair of my flesh stood up—
Job,4,16,It stood still; I could not discern the appearance thereof: a form was before mine eyes; I heard a slight murmur and a voice:
Job,4,17,Shall [mortal] man be more just than +God? Shall a man be purer than his Maker?
Job,4,18,"Lo, he trusteth not his servants, and his angels he chargeth with folly:"
Job,4,19,"How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed as the moth!"
Job,4,20,"From morning to evening are they smitten: without any heeding it, they perish for ever."
Job,4,21,"Is not their tent-cord torn away in them? they die, and without wisdom."
Job,5,1,"Call, I pray thee! Is there any that answereth thee? and to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?"
Job,5,2,"For vexation killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the simple."
Job,5,3,"I myself saw the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation."
Job,5,4,"His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, and there is no deliverer:"
Job,5,5,"Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh even out of the thorns; and the snare gapeth for his substance."
Job,5,6,"For evil cometh not forth from the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;"
Job,5,7,"For man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upwards."
Job,5,8,"But as for me I will seek unto God, and unto God commit my cause;"
Job,5,9,"Who doeth great things and unsearchable, marvellous things without number;"
Job,5,10,"Who giveth rain on the face of the earth, and sendeth waters on the face of the fields;"
Job,5,11,Setting up on high those that are low; and mourners are exalted to prosperity.
Job,5,12,"He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, and their hands carry not out the enterprise."
Job,5,13,He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and the counsel of the wily is carried headlong:
Job,5,14,"They meet with darkness in a the daytime, and grope at midday as in the night."
Job,5,15,"And he saveth the needy from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty."
Job,5,16,"So the poor hath what he hopeth for, and unrighteousness stoppeth her mouth."
Job,5,17,"Behold, happy is the man whom +God correcteth; therefore despise not the chastening of the Almighty."
Job,5,18,"For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; he woundeth, and his hands make whole."
Job,5,19,"He will deliver thee in six troubles, and in seven there shall no evil touch thee."
Job,5,20,"In famine he will redeem thee from death, and in war from the power of the sword."
Job,5,21,Thou shalt be hidden from the scourge of the tongue; and thou shalt not be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
Job,5,22,"At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh, and of the beasts of the earth thou shalt not be afraid."
Job,5,23,"For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee."
Job,5,24,"And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; and thou wilt survey thy fold, and miss nothing."
Job,5,25,"And thou shalt know that thy seed is numerous, and thine offspring as the herb of the earth."
Job,5,26,"Thou shalt come to the grave in a ripe age, as a shock of corn is brought in in its season."
Job,5,27,"Behold this, we have searched it out, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thyself."
Job,6,1,"And Job answered and said,"
Job,6,2,"Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!"
Job,6,3,For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; therefore my words are vehement.
Job,6,4,"For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, their poison drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of +God are arrayed against me."
Job,6,5,Doth the wild ass bray by the grass? loweth an ox over his fodder?
Job,6,6,Shall that which is insipid be eaten without salt? Is there any taste in the white of an egg?
Job,6,7,"What my soul refuseth to touch, that is as my loathsome food."
Job,6,8,"Oh that I might have my request, and that +God would grant my desire!"
Job,6,9,"And that it would please +God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!"
Job,6,10,Then should I yet have comfort; and in the pain which spareth not I would rejoice that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
Job,6,11,"What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should have patience?"
Job,6,12,Is my strength the strength of stones? is my flesh of brass?
Job,6,13,"Is it not that there is no help in me, and soundness is driven away from me?"
Job,6,14,For him that is fainting kindness [is meet] from his friend; or he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
Job,6,15,"My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a stream, as the channel of streams which pass away,"
Job,6,16,"Which are turbid by reason of the ice, in which the snow hideth itself:"
Job,6,17,"At the time they diminish, they are dried up; when heat affecteth them, they vanish from their place:"
Job,6,18,"They wind about in the paths of their course, they go off into the waste and perish."
Job,6,19,"The caravans of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba counted on them:"
Job,6,20,"They are ashamed at their hope; they come thither, and are confounded."
Job,6,21,So now ye are nothing; ye see a terrible object and are afraid.
Job,6,22,"Did I say, Bring unto me, and make me a present from your substance?"
Job,6,23,"Or, rescue me from the hand of the oppressor, and redeem me from the hand of the violent?"
Job,6,24,"Teach me, and I will hold my tongue; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred."
Job,6,25,How forcible are right words! but what doth your upbraiding reprove?
Job,6,26,Do ye imagine to reprove words? The speeches of one that is desperate are indeed for the wind.
Job,6,27,"Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and dig [a pit] for your friend."
Job,6,28,"Now therefore if ye will, look upon me; and it shall be to your face if I lie."
Job,6,29,"Return, I pray you, let there be no wrong; yea, return again, my righteousness shall be in it."
Job,6,30,Is there wrong in my tongue? cannot my taste discern mischievous things?
Job,7,1,Hath not man a life of labour upon earth? and are not his days like the days of a hireling?
Job,7,2,"As a bondman earnestly desireth the shadow, and a hireling expecteth his wages,"
Job,7,3,"So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me."
Job,7,4,"If I lie down, I say, When shall I rise up, and the darkness be gone? and I am full of tossings until the dawn."
Job,7,5,"My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and suppurates."
Job,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope."
Job,7,7,Remember thou that my life is wind; mine eye shall no more see good.
Job,7,8,"The eye of him that hath seen me shall behold me no [more]: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not."
Job,7,9,The cloud consumeth and vanisheth away; so he that goeth down to Sheol shall not come up.
Job,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him again."
Job,7,11,Therefore I will not restrain my mouth: I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,7,12,"Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, that thou settest a watch over me?"
Job,7,13,"When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;"
Job,7,14,"Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions;"
Job,7,15,"So that my soul chooseth strangling, death, rather than my bones."
Job,7,16,"I loathe it; I shall not live always: let me alone, for my days are a breath."
Job,7,17,"What is man, that thou makest much of him? and that thou settest thy heart upon him?"
Job,7,18,"And that thou visitest him every morning, triest him every moment?"
Job,7,19,"How long wilt thou not look away from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?"
Job,7,20,"Have I sinned, what do I unto thee, thou Observer of men? Why hast thou set me as an object of assault for thee, so that I am become a burden to myself?"
Job,7,21,"And why dost not thou forgive my transgression and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I lie down in the dust, and thou shalt seek me early, and I shall not be."
Job,8,1,"And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,"
Job,8,2,How long wilt thou speak these things? and the words of thy mouth be a strong wind?
Job,8,3,"Doth God pervert judgment, and the Almighty pervert justice?"
Job,8,4,"If thy children have sinned against him, he hath also given them over into the hand of their transgression."
Job,8,5,"If thou seek earnestly unto God, and make thy supplication to the Almighty,"
Job,8,6,"If thou be pure and upright, surely now he will awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous;"
Job,8,7,"And though thy beginning was small, yet thine end shall be very great."
Job,8,8,"For inquire, I pray thee, of the former generation, and attend to the researches of their fathers;"
Job,8,9,"For we are [but] of yesterday, and know nothing, for our days upon earth are a shadow."
Job,8,10,"Shall not they teach thee, [and] tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?"
Job,8,11,Doth the papyrus shoot up without mire? doth the reed-grass grow without water?
Job,8,12,"Whilst it is yet in its greenness [and] not cut down, it withereth before any [other] grass."
Job,8,13,"So are the paths of all that forget God; and the profane man’s hope shall perish,"
Job,8,14,"Whose confidence shall be cut off, and his reliance is a spider’s web."
Job,8,15,"He shall lean upon his house, and it shall not stand; he shall lay hold on it, but it shall not endure."
Job,8,16,"He is full of sap before the sun, and his sprout shooteth forth over his garden;"
Job,8,17,His roots are entwined about the stoneheap; he seeth the place of stones.
Job,8,18,"If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him: I have not seen thee!"
Job,8,19,"Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the dust shall others grow."
Job,8,20,"Behold, God will not cast off a perfect man, neither will he take evil-doers by the hand."
Job,8,21,"Whilst he would fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips with shouting,"
Job,8,22,"They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked be no more."
Job,9,1,"And Job answered and said,"
Job,9,2,Of a truth I know it is so; but how can man be just with God?
Job,9,3,"If he shall choose to strive with him, he cannot answer him one thing of a thousand."
Job,9,4,"He is wise in heart and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and had peace?"
Job,9,5,"Who removeth mountains, and they know it not, when he overturneth them in his anger;"
Job,9,6,"Who shaketh the earth out of its place, and the pillars thereof tremble;"
Job,9,7,"Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, and he sealeth up the stars;"
Job,9,8,"Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the high waves of the sea;"
Job,9,9,"Who maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south;"
Job,9,10,"Who doeth great things past finding out, and wonders without number."
Job,9,11,"Lo, he goeth by me, and I see [him] not; and he passeth along, and I perceive him not."
Job,9,12,"Behold, he taketh away: who will hinder him? Who will say unto him, What doest thou? 13+God withdraweth not his anger; the proud helpers stoop under him:"
Job,9,14,"How much less shall I answer him, choose out my words [to strive] with him?"
Job,9,15,"Whom, though I were righteous, [yet] would I not answer; I would make supplication to my judge."
Job,9,16,"If I had called, and he had answered me, I would not believe that he hearkened to my voice,—"
Job,9,17,"He, who crusheth me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause."
Job,9,18,"He suffereth me not to take my breath, for he filleth me with bitternesses."
Job,9,19,"Be it a question of strength, lo, [he is] strong; and be it of judgment, who will set me a time?"
Job,9,20,"If I justified myself, mine own mouth would condemn me; were I perfect, he would prove me perverse."
Job,9,21,"Were I perfect, [yet] would I not know my soul: I would despise my life."
Job,9,22,"It is all one; therefore I said, he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked."
Job,9,23,"If the scourge kill suddenly, he mocketh at the trial of the innocent."
Job,9,24,"The earth is given over into the hand of the wicked [man]; he covereth the faces of its judges. If not, who then is it?"
Job,9,25,"And my days are swifter than a runner: they flee away, they see no good."
Job,9,26,They pass by like skiffs of reed; as an eagle that swoops upon the prey.
Job,9,27,"If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my [sad] countenance, and brighten up,"
Job,9,28,I am afraid of all my sorrows; I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
Job,9,29,"Be it that I am wicked, why then do I labour in vain?"
Job,9,30,"If I washed myself with snow-water, and cleansed my hands in purity,"
Job,9,31,"Then wouldest thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes would abhor me."
Job,9,32,"For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him; that we should come together in judgment."
Job,9,33,"There is not an umpire between us, who should lay his hand upon us both."
Job,9,34,"Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his terror make me afraid, 35[Then] I will speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me."

Job,21,6,"Even when I think [thereon], I am affrighted, and trembling taketh hold of my flesh."
Job,21,7,"Wherefore do the wicked live, grow old, yea, become mighty in power?"
Job,21,8,"Their seed is established with them in their sight, and their offspring before their eyes."
Job,21,9,"Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of +God upon them."

Job,21,17,"How often is the lamp of the wicked put out, and cometh their calamity upon them? Doth he distribute sorrows [to them] in his anger?"
Job,21,18,"Do they become as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away? 19+God layeth up [the punishment of] his iniquity for his children; he rewardeth him, and he shall know [it]:"
Job,21,20,"His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the fury of the Almighty."
Job,21,21,"For what pleasure should he have in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off?"
Job,21,22,Can any teach God knowledge? And he it is that judgeth those that are high.
Job,21,23,"One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet;"
Job,21,24,"His sides are full of fat, and the marrow of his bones is moistened;"

Job,21,27,"Lo, I know your thoughts, and the devices ye wrongfully imagine against me."
Job,21,28,"For ye say, Where is the house of the noble? and where the tent of the dwellings of the wicked?"
Job,21,29,Have ye not asked the wayfarers? and do ye not regard their tokens:

Job,21,31,Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
Job,21,32,"Yet is he carried to the graves, and watch is kept over the tomb."
Job,21,33,"The clods of the valley are sweet unto him; and every man followeth suit after him, as there were innumerable before him."
Job,21,34,How then comfort ye me in vain? Your answers remain perfidious.
Job,22,1,"And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,"
Job,22,2,Can a man be profitable to God? surely it is unto himself that the wise man is profitable.
Job,22,3,Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if thou art righteous? And is it gain [to him] that thou makest thy ways perfect?
Job,22,4,Will he reason with thee for fear of thee? Will he enter with thee into judgment?
Job,22,5,Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities without end?
Job,22,6,"For thou hast taken a pledge of thy brother for nought, and stripped off the clothing of the naked."

Job,22,12,Is not +God in the height of the heavens? And behold the summit of the stars: how exalted are they!
Job,22,13,"And thou sayest, What doth God know? will he judge through the dark cloud?"
Job,22,14,"Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh on the vault of the heavens."
Job,22,15,Dost thou mark the ancient path which wicked men have trodden?
Job,22,16,"Who were carried off before the time, whose foundation was overflowed with a flood;"
Job,22,17,"Who said unto God, Depart from us! and what could the Almighty do to them?"
Job,22,18,Yet he filled their houses with good. But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job,22,19,"The righteous see it, and are glad; and the innocent laugh them to scorn:"
Job,22,20,"Is not he who rose against us destroyed, and doth not the fire consume his residue?"
Job,22,21,"Reconcile thyself now with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee."
Job,22,22,"Receive, I pray thee, instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart."
Job,22,23,"If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up. If thou remove unrighteousness far from thy tents,"
Job,22,24,"And put the precious ore with the dust, and [the gold of] Ophir among the stones of the torrents,"
Job,22,25,"Then the Almighty will be thy precious ore, and silver heaped up unto thee;"

Job,22,29,"When they are made low, then thou shalt say, Rise up! and he shall save him that is of downcast eyes. 30[Even] him that is not innocent shall he deliver; yea, he shall be delivered by the pureness of thy hands."
Job,23,1,"And Job answered and said,"
Job,23,2,Even to-day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
Job,23,3,"Oh that I knew where I might find him, that I might come to his seat!"
Job,23,4,"I would order the cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments;"
Job,23,5,"I would know the words he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me."
Job,23,6,Would he plead against me with [his] great power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.
Job,23,7,There would an upright man reason with him; and I should be delivered for ever from my judge.
Job,23,8,"Lo, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I do not perceive him;"

Job,23,10,"But he knoweth the way that I take; he trieth me, I shall come forth as gold."
Job,23,11,"My foot hath held to his steps; his way have I kept, and not turned aside."
Job,23,12,Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have laid up the words of his mouth more than the purpose of my own heart.
Job,23,13,"But he is in one [mind], and who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, that will he do."
Job,23,14,For he will perform [what] is appointed for me; and many such things are with him.
Job,23,15,"Therefore am I troubled at his presence; I consider, and I am afraid of him."

Job,23,17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he hidden the gloom from me."
Job,24,1,Why are not times treasured up with the Almighty? why do not they that know him see his days?
Job,24,2,They remove the landmarks; they violently take away the flocks and pasture them;
Job,24,3,"They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge;"
Job,24,4,They turn the needy out of the way: the afflicted of the land all hide themselves.
Job,24,5,"Lo, [as] wild asses in the desert, they go forth to their work, seeking early for the prey: the wilderness [yieldeth] them food for [their] children."

Job,24,14,"The murderer riseth with the light, killeth the afflicted and needy, and in the night is as a thief."
Job,24,15,"And the eye of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me; and he putteth a covering on [his] face."
Job,24,16,In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves in; they know not the light:

Job,24,22,"He draweth also the mighty with his power; he riseth up, and no [man] is sure of life. 23[God] setteth him in safety, and he resteth thereon; but his eyes are upon their ways."
Job,24,24,"They are exalted for a little, and are no more; they are laid low; like all [other] are they gathered, and are cut off as the tops of the ears of corn."
Job,24,25,"If it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?"

Job,25,3,Is there any number of his troops? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
Job,25,4,And how should man be just with God? Or how should he be clean that is born of a woman?
Job,25,5,"Lo, even the moon is not bright; and the stars are not pure in his sight:"
Job,25,6,"How much less man, a worm, and the son of man, a worm!"
Job,26,1,"And Job answered and said,"
Job,26,2,How hast thou helped the powerless; how saved the arm that is without strength!
Job,26,3,"How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, and abundantly declared the thing as it is!"

Job,27,3,"All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of +God is in my nostrils,"
Job,27,4,"My lips shall not speak unrighteousness, nor my tongue utter deceit!"

Job,27,6,"My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart reproacheth [me] not one of my days. The Wicked Man’s Portion"
Job,27,7,"Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous."
Job,27,8,"For what is the hope of the ungodly, when [God] cutteth him off, when +God taketh away his soul?"
Job,27,9,Will God hear his cry when distress cometh upon him?
Job,27,10,Doth he delight himself in the Almighty? will he at all times call upon +God?
Job,27,11,I will teach you concerning the hand of God; what is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
Job,27,12,"Behold, ye yourselves have all seen [it]; and why are ye thus altogether vain?"
Job,27,13,"This is the portion of the wicked man with God, and the heritage of the violent, which they receive from the Almighty:—"
Job,27,14,"If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword, and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread;"
Job,27,15,"Those that remain of him shall be buried by death, and his widows shall not weep."
Job,27,16,"Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as the clay;"
Job,27,17,"He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on; and the innocent shall divide the silver."
Job,27,18,"He buildeth his house as the moth, and as a booth that a keeper maketh."
Job,27,19,"He lieth down rich, but will do so no more; he openeth his eyes, and he is not."
Job,27,20,Terrors overtake him like waters; a whirlwind stealeth him away in the night.
Job,27,21,The east wind carrieth him away and he is gone; and as a storm it hurleth him out of his place.
Job,27,22,"And [God] shall cast upon him and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. 23[Men] shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place."
Job,28,1,"Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold which they refine;"
Job,28,2,"Iron is taken out of the dust, and copper is molten out of the stone. 3[Man] putteth an end to the darkness, and exploreth to the utmost limit, the stones of darkness and of the shadow of death."

Job,28,7,"It is a path no bird of prey knoweth, and the vulture’s eye hath not seen it;"

Job,28,11,"He bindeth the streams that they drip not, and what is hidden he bringeth forth to light."

Job,28,18,"Corals and crystal are no more remembered; yea, the acquisition of wisdom is above rubies."
Job,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be compared to it, neither shall it be set in the balance with pure gold."

Job,28,21,"For it is hidden from the eyes of all living, and concealed from the fowl of the heavens."
Job,28,22,"Destruction and death say, We have heard its report with our ears."
Job,28,23,"God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth its place:"
Job,28,24,"For he looketh to the ends of the earth, he seeth under the whole heaven."
Job,28,25,"In making a weight for the wind, and meting out the waters by measure,"
Job,28,26,"In appointing a statute for the rain, and a way for the thunder’s flash:"
Job,28,27,"Then did he see it, and declare it; he established it, yea, and searched it out;"

Job,29,2,"Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when +God preserved me;"

Job,29,19,"My root shall be spread out to the waters, and the dew will lie all night on my branch;"
Job,29,20,"My glory shall be fresh in me, and my bow be renewed in my hand."
Job,29,21,"Unto me they listened, and waited, and kept silence for my counsel:"
Job,29,22,"After my words they spoke not again, and my speech dropped upon them;"
Job,29,23,"And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. 24[If] I laughed on them, they believed [it] not; and they troubled not the serenity of my countenance."
Job,29,25,"I chose their way, and sat as chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth mourners."
Job,30,1,"But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock."
Job,30,2,"Yea, whereto [should] the strength of their hands [profit] me, [men] in whom vigour hath perished?"
Job,30,3,"Withered up through want and hunger, they flee into waste places long since desolate and desert:"
Job,30,4,"They gather the salt-wort among the bushes, and the roots of the broom for their food."
Job,30,5,They are driven forth from among [men]—they cry after them as after a thief—
Job,30,6,"To dwell in gloomy gorges, in caves of the earth and the rocks:"
Job,30,7,They bray among the bushes; under the brambles they are gathered together:
Job,30,8,"Sons of fools, and sons of nameless sires, they are driven out of the land."
Job,30,9,"And now I am their song, yea, I am their byword."
Job,30,10,"They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, yea, they spare not to spit in my face."
Job,30,11,For he hath loosed my cord and afflicted me; so they cast off the bridle before me.
Job,30,12,"At [my] right hand rise the young brood; they push away my feet, and raise up against me their pernicious ways;"
Job,30,13,"They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, without any to help them;"
Job,30,14,They come in as through a wide breach: amid the confusion they roll themselves onward. Job’s Prosperity Becomes Calamity
Job,30,15,Terrors are turned against me; they pursue mine honour as the wind; and my welfare is passed away like a cloud.
Job,30,16,And now my soul is poured out in me; days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
Job,30,17,"The night pierceth through my bones [and detacheth them] from me, and my gnawing pains take no rest:"
Job,30,18,By their great force they have become my raiment; they bind me about as the collar of my coat.
Job,30,19,"He hath cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes."
Job,30,20,"I cry unto thee, and thou answerest me not; I stand up, and thou lookest at me."
Job,30,21,Thou art changed to a cruel one to me; with the strength of thy hand thou pursuest me.
Job,30,22,"Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to be borne away, and dissolvest my substance."
Job,30,23,"For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and into the house of assemblage for all living."
Job,30,24,"Indeed, no prayer [availeth] when he stretcheth out [his] hand: though they cry when he destroyeth."
Job,30,25,Did not I weep for him whose days were hard? was not my soul grieved for the needy?

Job,30,27,"My bowels well up, and rest not; days of affliction have confronted me."
Job,30,28,"I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up, I cry in the congregation."
Job,30,29,"I am become a brother to jackals, and a companion of ostriches."
Job,30,30,"My skin is become black [and falleth] off me, and my bones are parched with heat."
Job,30,31,"My harp also is [turned] to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of weepers."
Job,31,1,I made a covenant with mine eyes; and how should I fix my regard upon a maid?
Job,31,2,"For what would have been [my] portion of +God from above, and what the heritage of the Almighty from on high?"
Job,31,3,Is not calamity for the unrighteous? and misfortune for the workers of iniquity?
Job,31,4,"Doth not he see my ways, and number all my steps?"
Job,31,5,"If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot hath hasted to deceit, 6(Let me be weighed in an even balance, and +God will take knowledge of my blamelessness;)"

Job,31,9,"If my heart have been enticed unto a woman, so that I laid wait at my neighbour’s door,"
Job,31,10,"Let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down upon her."
Job,31,11,"For this is an infamy; yea, it is an iniquity [to be judged by] the judges:"
Job,31,12,"For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase."
Job,31,13,"If I have despised the cause of my bondman or of my bondmaid, when they contended with me,"
Job,31,14,"What then should I do when God riseth up? and if he visited, what should I answer him?"
Job,31,15,Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not One fashion us in the womb?
Job,31,16,"If I have withheld the poor from [their] desire, or caused the eyes of the widow to fail;"
Job,31,17,"Or have eaten my morsel alone, so that the fatherless ate not thereof, 18(For from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, and I have guided the [widow] from my mother’s womb;)"
Job,31,19,"If I have seen any perishing for want of clothing, or any needy without covering;"
Job,31,20,"If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my lambs;"
Job,31,21,"If I have lifted up my hand against an orphan, because I saw my help in the gate: 22[Then] let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone!"
Job,31,23,"For calamity from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his excellency I was powerless."
Job,31,24,"If I have made gold my hope, or said to the fine gold, My confidence!"
Job,31,25,"If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much;"
Job,31,26,"If I beheld the sun when it shone, or the moon walking in brightness,"
Job,31,27,"And my heart have been secretly enticed, so that my mouth kissed my hand:"
Job,31,28,"This also would be an iniquity for the judge, for I should have denied the God who is above."
Job,31,29,"If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, and exulted when evil befell him; 30(Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse;)"
Job,31,31,"If the men of my tent said not, Who shall find one that hath not been satisfied with his meat?—"
Job,31,32,The stranger did not lodge without; I opened my doors to the pathway.
Job,31,33,"If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom,"
Job,31,34,"Because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and went not out of the door,..."
Job,31,35,Oh that I had one to hear me! Behold my signature: let the Almighty answer me! And let mine opponent write an accusation!
Job,31,36,Would I not take it upon my shoulder? I would bind it on to me [as] a crown;
Job,31,37,I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I come near to him.
Job,31,38,"If my land cry out against me, and its furrows weep together;"
Job,31,39,"If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, and have tormented to death the souls of its owners:"
Job,31,40,"Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and tares instead of barley. The words of Job are ended."
Job,32,1,"And these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,"Then was kindled the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his anger kindled, because he justified himself rather than God; 3and against his three friends was his"
Job,32,4,But Elihu had waited till Job
Job,32,5,"And Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger was kindled."
Job,32,6,"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are aged; wherefore I was timid, and feared to shew you what I know."
Job,32,7,"I said, Let days speak, and multitude of years teach wisdom."
Job,32,8,But there is a spirit which is in man; and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
Job,32,9,It is not the great that are wise; neither do the aged understand judgment.
Job,32,10,"Therefore I say, Hearken to me; I also will shew what I know."
Job,32,11,"Lo, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasonings, until ye searched out what to say."
Job,32,12,"Yea, I gave you mine attention, and behold, there was none of you that confuted Job, that answered his words;"
Job,32,13,"That ye may not say, We have found out wisdom; God will make him yield, not man."
Job,32,14,Now he hath not directed [his] words against me; and I will not answer him with your speeches....
Job,32,15,"They were amazed, they answered no more; words failed them."
Job,32,16,"And I waited, for they spoke not, but stood still, and answered no more;—"
Job,32,17,"I will answer, I also in my turn, I also will shew what I know:"
Job,32,18,"For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me."
Job,32,19,"Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; like new flasks, it is ready to burst."
Job,32,20,"I will speak, that I may find relief; I will open my lips and answer."
Job,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person; neither will I give flattery to man."
Job,32,22,For I know not how to flatter; my Maker would soon take me away.
Job,33,1,"Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear mine utterances, and hearken to all my words."
Job,33,2,"Behold now, I have opened my mouth, my tongue speaketh in my palate,"
Job,33,3,"My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart, and my lips shall utter knowledge purely."
Job,33,4,"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life."
Job,33,5,"If thou canst, answer me; array [thy words] before me: take thy stand."
Job,33,6,"Behold, before God I am as thou; I also am formed out of the clay."
Job,33,7,"Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, nor my burden be heavy upon thee."
Job,33,8,"Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of [thy] words:—"
Job,33,9,"I am clean without transgression; I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me;"
Job,33,10,"Lo, he findeth occasions of hostility against me, he counteth me for his enemy;"
Job,33,11,"He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths."
Job,33,12,"Behold, I will answer thee in this, thou art not right; for +God is greater than man."
Job,33,13,Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
Job,33,14,"For God speaketh once, and twice,—[and man] perceiveth it not—"
Job,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;"
Job,33,16,"Then he openeth men’s ears, and sealeth their instruction,"
Job,33,17,"That he may withdraw man [from his] work, and hide pride from man."
Job,33,18,"He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from passing away by the sword."
Job,33,19,"He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and with constant strife in his bones;"
Job,33,20,"And his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food;"
Job,33,21,"His flesh is consumed away from view, and his bones that were not seen stick out;"
Job,33,22,"And his soul draweth near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers."
Job,33,23,"If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his duty;"
Job,33,24,"Then he will be gracious unto him, and say, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom."
Job,33,25,His flesh shall be fresher than in childhood; he shall return to the days of his youth.
Job,33,26,"He shall pray unto +God, and he will receive him with favour; and he shall see his face with shoutings, and he will render unto man his righteousness."
Job,33,27,"He will sing before men, and say, I have sinned, and perverted what was right, and it hath not been requited to me;"
Job,33,28,"He hath delivered my soul from going into the pit, and my life shall see the light."
Job,33,29,"Lo, all these [things] worketh God twice, thrice, with man,"
Job,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living."
Job,33,31,"Mark well, Job, hearken unto me; be silent, and I will speak."
Job,33,32,"If thou hast anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify thee."
Job,33,33,"If not, hearken thou unto me; be silent, and I will teach thee wisdom."
Job,34,1,"Moreover Elihu answered and said,"
Job,34,2,"Hear my words, ye wise [men]; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge."
Job,34,3,"For the ear trieth words, as the palate tasteth food."
Job,34,4,Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us know among ourselves what is good!
Job,34,5,"For Job hath said, I am righteous, and God hath taken away my judgment:"
Job,34,6,Should I lie against my right? My wound is incurable without transgression.
Job,34,7,"What man is like Job? he drinketh up scorning like water,"
Job,34,8,"And goeth in company with workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men."
Job,34,9,"For he hath said, It profiteth not a man if he delight himself in God."
Job,34,10,"Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be wickedness from God, and wrong from the Almighty!"
Job,34,11,"For a man’s work will he render to him, and cause every one to find according to [his] way."
Job,34,12,"Yea, surely, God acteth not wickedly, and the Almighty perverteth not judgment."
Job,34,13,Who hath entrusted to him the earth? and who hath disposed the whole world?
Job,34,14,"If he only thought of himself, [and] gathered unto him his spirit and his breath,"
Job,34,15,"All flesh would expire together, and man would return to the dust."
Job,34,16,"If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: give ear to the voice of my words!"
Job,34,17,Should he that hateth right indeed govern? and wilt thou condemn the All-just?
Job,34,18,"Shall one say to a king, Belial? to nobles, Wicked? 19[How then to him] that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich man more than the poor? for they are all the work of his hands."
Job,34,20,"In a moment they die, even at midnight the people are convulsed and pass away; and the strong are taken away without hand."
Job,34,21,"For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his steps."
Job,34,22,"There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
Job,34,23,"For he doth not long consider a man, to bring him before God in judgment."
Job,34,24,"He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquiry, and setteth others in their stead;"
Job,34,25,"Since he knoweth their actions; and he overthroweth [them] in the night, and they are crushed."
Job,34,26,"He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others,"
Job,34,27,"Because they have turned back from him, and would consider none of his ways;"
Job,34,28,"So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted."
Job,34,29,"When he giveth quietness, who then will disturb? and when he hideth [his] face, who shall behold him? and this towards a nation, or towards a man alike;"
Job,34,30,"That the ungodly man reign not, that the people be not ensnared."
Job,34,31,"For hath he said unto God, I bear [chastisement], I will not offend;"
Job,34,32,"What I see not, teach thou me; if I have done wrong, I will do so no more?"
Job,34,33,"Shall he recompense according to thy mind? for thou hast refused [his judgment]; for thou so choosest, and not I; speak then what thou knowest."
Job,34,34,"Men of understanding will say to me, and a wise man who heareth me:"
Job,34,35,"Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were not with intelligence."
Job,34,36,"Would that Job may be tried unto the end, because of [his] answers after the manner of evil men!"
Job,34,37,"For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his hands] among us, and multiplieth his words against God."
Job,35,1,"Moreover Elihu answered and said,"
Job,35,2,"Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God’s?"
Job,35,3,For thou hast asked of what profit it is unto thee: what do I gain more than if I had sinned?
Job,35,4,"I will reply to thee in words, and to thy companions with thee."
Job,35,5,Look unto the heavens and see; and survey the skies: they are higher than thou.
Job,35,6,"If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? If thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?"
Job,35,7,"If thou be righteous, what givest thou to him? or what doth he receive of thy hand?"
Job,35,8,"Thy wickedness [may affect] a man as thou [art], and thy righteousness a son of man."
Job,35,9,By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry; they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty:
Job,35,10,"But none saith, Where is +God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night,"
Job,35,11,"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowl of the heavens?"
Job,35,12,"There they cry, and he answereth not, because of the pride of evil men."
Job,35,13,"Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it."
Job,35,14,"Although thou sayest thou dost not see him, judgment is before him, therefore wait for him."
Job,35,15,"But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, doth not [Job] know [his] great arrogancy?"
Job,35,16,"For Job hath opened his mouth in vanity, and made words abundant without knowledge."
Job,36,1,"And Elihu proceeded and said,"
Job,36,2,"Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet words for +God."
Job,36,3,"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Creator."
Job,36,4,For truly my words shall be no falsehood: one perfect in knowledge is with thee.
Job,36,5,"Lo, God is mighty, but despiseth not [any]; mighty in strength of understanding:"
Job,36,6,He saveth not the wicked alive; but he doeth justice to the afflicted.
Job,36,7,"He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne doth he even set them for ever; and they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"And if, bound in fetters, they be held in cords of affliction,"
Job,36,9,"Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions, because they have increased."
Job,36,10,"And he openeth their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity."
Job,36,11,"If they hearken and serve [him], they shall accomplish their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures."
Job,36,12,"But if they hearken not, they shall pass away by the sword, and expire without knowledge."
Job,36,13,But the godless in heart heap up anger; they cry not when he bindeth them:
Job,36,14,"Their soul dieth in youth, and their life is among the unclean."
Job,36,15,"But he delivereth the afflicted in his affliction, and openeth their ear in [their] oppression."
Job,36,16,"Even so would he have allured thee out of the jaws of distress into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and the supply of thy table [would be] full of fatness."
Job,36,17,But thou art full of the judgments of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold [on thee].
Job,36,18,"Because there is wrath, [beware] lest it take thee away through chastisement: then a great ransom could not avail thee."
Job,36,19,"Will he esteem thy riches? Not gold, nor all the resources of strength!"
Job,36,20,"Desire not the night, when peoples are cut off from their place."
Job,36,21,"Take heed, turn not to iniquity; for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction."
Job,36,22,"Lo, God is exalted in his power: who teacheth as he?"
Job,36,23,"Who hath appointed him his way? or who hath said, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?"
Job,36,24,"Remember that thou magnify his work, which men celebrate."
Job,36,25,All men look at it; man beholdeth [it] afar off.
Job,36,26,"Lo, God is great, and we comprehend [him] not, neither can the number of his years be searched out."
Job,36,27,"For he draweth up the drops of water: they distil in rain from the vapour which he formeth,"
Job,36,28,Which the skies pour down [and] drop upon man abundantly.
Job,36,29,"But can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, [or] the crashing of his pavilion?"
Job,36,30,"Lo, he spreadeth his light around him, and covereth the bottom of the sea."
Job,36,31,"For with them he judgeth the peoples; he giveth food in abundance. 32[His] hands he covereth with lightning, and commandeth it where it is to strike."
Job,36,33,"His thundering declareth concerning him; the cattle even, concerning its coming."
Job,37,1,"Aye, my heart trembleth at this also, and leapeth up out of its place:"
Job,37,2,"Hear attentively the roar of his voice, and the murmur going forth from his mouth."
Job,37,3,"He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth."
Job,37,4,"After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency, and holdeth not back the flashes when his voice is heard."
Job,37,5,"God thundereth marvellously with his voice, doing great things which we do not comprehend."
Job,37,6,"For he saith to the snow, Fall on the earth! and to the pouring rain, even the pouring rains of his might."
Job,37,7,He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
Job,37,8,"And the wild beast goeth into its lair, and they remain in their dens."
Job,37,9,From the chamber [of the south] cometh the whirlwind; and cold from the winds of the north.
Job,37,10,By the breath of God ice is given; and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
Job,37,11,"Also with plentiful moisture he loadeth the thick clouds, his light dispels the cloud;"
Job,37,12,"And they are turned every way by his guidance, that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the circuit of the earth,"
Job,37,13,"Whether he cause it to come as a rod, or for his land, or in mercy."
Job,37,14,"Hearken unto this, Job; stand still and discern the wondrous works of God."
Job,37,15,"Dost thou know how +God hath disposed them, and how he causeth the lightning of his cloud to flash?"
Job,37,16,"Dost thou know about the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him that is perfect in knowledge?"
Job,37,17,How thy garments become warm when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?
Job,37,18,"Hast thou with him spread out the sky, firm, like a molten mirror?"
Job,37,19,Teach us what we shall say unto him! We cannot order [our words] by reason of darkness.
Job,37,20,"Shall it be told him if I would speak? if a man [so] say, surely he shall be swallowed up."
Job,37,21,"And now [men] see not the light as it gleameth, it is [hidden] in the skies. But the wind passeth by and cleareth them."
Job,37,22,From the north cometh gold; with +God is terrible majesty.
Job,37,23,"The Almighty, we cannot find him out: excellent in power, and in judgment, and in abundance of justice, he doth not afflict."
Job,37,24,Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
Job,38,1,"And Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,"
Job,38,2,Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
Job,38,3,"Gird up now thy loins like a man; and I will demand of thee, and inform thou me."
Job,38,4,"Where wast thou when I founded the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding."
Job,38,5,Who set the measures thereof—if thou knowest? or who stretched a line upon it?
Job,38,6,"Whereupon were the foundations thereof sunken? or who laid its corner-stone,"
Job,38,7,"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
Job,38,8,"And who shut up the sea with doors, when it burst forth, issuing out of the womb?"
Job,38,9,"When I made the cloud its garment, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it;"
Job,38,10,"When I cut out for it my boundary, and set bars and doors,"
Job,38,11,"And said, Hitherto shalt thou come and no further, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?"
Job,38,12,"Hast thou since thy days commanded the morning? hast thou caused the dawn to know its place,"
Job,38,13,"That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and the wicked might be shaken out of it?"
Job,38,14,It is changed like the signet-clay; and [all things] stand forth as in a garment:
Job,38,15,"And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the uplifted arm is broken."
Job,38,16,Hast thou entered as far as the springs of the sea? and hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?
Job,38,17,Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? and hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?
Job,38,18,Hath thine understanding compassed the breadths of the earth? Declare if thou knowest it all.
Job,38,19,"Where is the way to where light dwelleth? and the darkness, where is its place,"
Job,38,20,"That thou shouldest take it to its bound, and that thou shouldest know the paths to its house?"
Job,38,21,"Thou knowest, for thou wast then born, and the number of thy days is great!"
Job,38,22,"Hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow, and hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,"
Job,38,23,"Which I have reserved for the time of distress, for the day of battle and war?"
Job,38,24,"By what way is the light parted, [and] the east wind scattered upon the earth?"
Job,38,25,"Who hath divided a channel for the rain-flood, and a way for the thunder’s flash;"
Job,38,26,"To cause it to rain on the earth, where no one is; on the wilderness wherein there is not a man;"
Job,38,27,"To satisfy the desolate and waste [ground], and to cause the sprout of the grass to spring forth?"
Job,38,28,Hath the rain a father? or who begetteth the drops of dew?
Job,38,29,"Out of whose womb cometh the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who bringeth it forth?"
Job,38,30,"When the waters lie hidden as in stone, and the face of the deep holdeth fast together."
Job,38,31,"Canst thou fasten the bands of the Pleiades, or loosen the cords of Orion?"
Job,38,32,Dost thou bring forth the constellations each in its season? or dost thou guide the Bear with her sons?
Job,38,33,Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? dost thou determine their rule over the earth?
Job,38,34,"Dost thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that floods of waters may cover thee?"
Job,38,35,"Dost thou send forth lightnings that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?"
Job,38,36,Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the mind?
Job,38,37,"Who numbereth the clouds with wisdom? or who poureth out the bottles of the heavens,"
Job,38,38,"When the dust runneth as into a molten mass, and the clods cleave fast together?"
Job,38,39,"Dost thou hunt the prey for the lioness, and dost thou satisfy the appetite of the young lions,"
Job,38,40,"When they crouch in [their] dens, [and] abide in the thicket to lie in wait?"
Job,38,41,"Who provideth for the raven his food, when his young ones cry unto God, [and] they wander for lack of meat?"
Job,39,1,Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? dost thou mark the calving of the hinds?
Job,39,2,Dost thou number the months that they fulfil? and knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
Job,39,3,"They bow themselves, they give birth to their young ones, they cast out their pains;"
Job,39,4,"Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field, they go forth, and return not unto them."
Job,39,5,"Who hath sent out the wild ass free? and who hath loosed the bands of the onager,"
Job,39,6,"Whose house I made the wilderness, and the salt plain his dwellings?"
Job,39,7,"He laugheth at the tumult of the city, and heareth not the shouts of the driver;"
Job,39,8,"The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing."
Job,39,9,"Will the buffalo be willing to serve thee, or will he lodge by thy crib?"
Job,39,10,Canst thou bind the buffalo with his cord in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
Job,39,11,"Wilt thou put confidence in him, because his strength is great? and wilt thou leave thy labour to him?"
Job,39,12,"Wilt thou trust him to bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy threshing-floor?"
Job,39,13,The wing of the ostrich beats joyously—But is it the stork’s pinion and plumage?
Job,39,14,"For she leaveth her eggs to the earth, and warmeth them in the dust,"
Job,39,15,"And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the beast of the field may trample them."
Job,39,16,"She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers; her labour is in vain, without her concern."
Job,39,17,"For +God hath deprived her of wisdom, and hath not furnished her with understanding."
Job,39,18,"What time she lasheth herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider."
Job,39,19,Hast thou given strength to the horse? hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?
Job,39,20,Dost thou make him to leap as a locust? His majestic snorting is terrible.
Job,39,21,"He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in [his] strength; he goeth forth to meet the armed host."
Job,39,22,"He laugheth at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from before the sword."
Job,39,23,"The quiver rattleth upon him, the glittering spear and the javelin."
Job,39,24,"He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage, and cannot contain himself at the sound of the trumpet:"
Job,39,25,"At the noise of the trumpets he saith, Aha! and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting."
Job,39,26,"Doth the hawk fly by thine intelligence, [and] stretch his wings toward the south?"
Job,39,27,"Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make his nest on high?"
Job,39,28,"He inhabiteth the rock and maketh his dwelling on the point of the cliff, and the fastness:"
Job,39,29,"From thence he spieth out the prey, his eyes look into the distance;"
Job,39,30,"And his young ones suck up blood; and where the slain are, there is he."
Job,40,1,"And Jehovah answered Job and said,"
Job,40,2,"Shall he that will contend with the Almighty instruct [him]? he that reproveth +God, let him answer it."
Job,40,3,"And Job answered Jehovah and said,"
Job,40,4,"Behold, I am nought: what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth."
Job,40,5,"Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further. The LORD Challenges Job Again"
Job,40,6,"And Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,"
Job,40,7,"Gird up now thy loins like a man: I will demand of thee, and inform thou me."
Job,40,8,Wilt thou also annul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous?
Job,40,9,Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
Job,40,10,"Deck thyself now with glory and excellency, and clothe thyself with majesty and splendour."
Job,40,11,"Cast abroad the ragings of thine anger, and look on every one that is proud, and abase him:"
Job,40,12,"Look on every one that is proud, bring him low, and tread down the wicked in their place:"
Job,40,13,Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in secret.
Job,40,14,"Then will I also praise thee, because thy right hand saveth thee."
Job,40,15,"See now the behemoth, which I made with thee: he eateth grass as an ox."
Job,40,16,"Behold now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the muscles of his belly."
Job,40,17,He bendeth his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are woven together.
Job,40,18,"His bones are tubes of bronze, his members are like bars of iron."
Job,40,19,He is the chief of God’s ways: he that made him gave him his sword.
Job,40,20,"For the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play."
Job,40,21,"He lieth under lotus-bushes, in the covert of the reed and fen:"
Job,40,22,Lotus-bushes cover him with their shade; the willows of the brook surround him.
Job,40,23,"Lo, the river overfloweth—he startleth not: he is confident though a Jordan break forth against his mouth."
Job,40,24,Shall he be taken in front? will they pierce through [his] nose in the trap?
Job,41,1,"Wilt thou draw out the leviathan with the hook, and press down his tongue with a cord?"
Job,41,2,"Wilt thou put a rush-rope into his nose, and pierce his jaw with a spike?"
Job,41,3,Will he make many supplications unto thee? or will he speak softly unto thee?
Job,41,4,Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him as a bondman for ever?
Job,41,5,"Wilt thou play with him as with a bird, and wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?"
Job,41,6,"Shall partners make traffic of him, will they divide him among merchants?"
Job,41,7,"Wilt thou fill his skin with darts, and his head with fish-spears?"
Job,41,8,"Lay thy hand upon him; remember the battle,—do no more!"
Job,41,9,"Lo, hope as to him is belied: is not one cast down even at the sight of him?"
Job,41,10,None is so bold as to stir him up; and who is he that will stand before me?
Job,41,11,"Who hath first given to me, that I should repay [him]? [Whatsoever is] under the whole heaven is mine."
Job,41,12,"I will not be silent as to his parts, the story of his power, and the beauty of his structure."
Job,41,13,Who can uncover the surface of his garment? who can come within his double jaws?
Job,41,14,Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.
Job,41,15,"The rows of his shields are a pride, shut up together [as with] a close seal."
Job,41,16,One is so near to another that no air can come between them;
Job,41,17,"They are joined each to its fellow; they stick together, and cannot be sundered."
Job,41,18,"His sneezings flash light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning."
Job,41,19,Out of his mouth go forth flames; sparks of fire leap out:
Job,41,20,"Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a boiling pot and cauldron."
Job,41,21,"His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth."

Daniel,1,12,"Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink; 13then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king’s delicate food: and as thou shalt see, deal with thy servants."
Daniel,1,14,"And he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days."
Daniel,1,15,And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and were fatter in flesh than all the youths that ate of the king’s

Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered before the king and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter; therefore there is no king, however great and powerful,"
Daniel,2,11,"For the thing that the king demandeth is extraordinary, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."
Daniel,2,12,"For this cause the king was irritated and very wroth, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of"
Daniel,2,13,And the decree went forth that the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to slay them. The Dream Revealed to Daniel
Daniel,2,14,"Then Daniel answered with counsel and prudence to Arioch the chief of the king’s bodyguard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon: 15he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain,"
Daniel,2,16,"And Daniel went in, and requested of the king that he would give him time, that he might shew the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions; 18that they would desire mercies of the God of the heavens concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,19,Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of the heavens.
Daniel,2,20,"Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; For wisdom and might are his."
Daniel,2,21,"And it is he that changeth times and seasons; He deposeth kings, and setteth up kings; He giveth wisdom to the wise, And knowledge to them that know understanding."
Daniel,2,22,"It is he that revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him."
Daniel,2,23,"I thank thee, and I praise thee, O God of my fathers, Who hast given me wisdom and might, And hast made known unto me already what we desired of thee; For thou hast made known unto us the king’s matter. Daniel Interprets the Dream"
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him: I have found a man"
Daniel,2,26,"The king answered and said unto Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said, The secret that the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the magicians, the scribes, the astrologers, shew unto the king; 28but there is a God in the heavens, who revealeth secrets, and maketh known to king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be at the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these: 29—as for thee, O king, thy thoughts arose upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall"
Daniel,2,30,"And as for me, this secret is revealed to me, not by [any] wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation should be made known to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart."
Daniel,2,31,"Thou, O king, sawest, and behold, a great image. This image was mighty and its brightness excellent;"
Daniel,2,32,"This image’s head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, 33its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of"
Daniel,2,34,Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands; and it smote the image upon its feet of iron
Daniel,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken in pieces together, and they became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them. And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.
Daniel,2,37,"Thou, O king, art a king of kings, unto whom the God of the heavens hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory; 38and wheresoever the children of men, the beasts of the field, and the fowl of the heavens dwell, he hath given them into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all: thou art this head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; then another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth."
Daniel,2,40,And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth
Daniel,2,41,"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter’s clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay."
Daniel,2,42,"And [as] the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay, the kingdom shall be partly strong"
Daniel,2,43,"And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay."
Daniel,2,44,And in the days of these kings shall the God of the heavens set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the sovereignty thereof shall not be left to another people: it shall break in pieces and
Daniel,2,45,"Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold,—the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. And the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it sure. Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel"
Daniel,2,46,"Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should"

Daniel,3,7,"Therefore at that time when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages fell down [and] worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Accused"
Daniel,3,8,"Whereupon at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews."
Daniel,3,9,They spoke and said
Daniel,3,10,"Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image; 11and [that] whosoever doth not fall down and"
Daniel,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego: these men, O king, regard thee not; they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image that thou hast set up."
Daniel,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego."
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them, Is it of purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image"
Daniel,3,15,"Now if ye be ready at the time that ye hear the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, [well]: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast that same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hands?"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no"
Daniel,3,17,"If it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from"
Daniel,3,18,"But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image that thou hast set up. The Fiery Furnace"
Daniel,3,19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. He spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times"
Daniel,3,20,And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army
Daniel,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their cloaks, and their garments, and were cast into"
Daniel,3,22,"Forasmuch as the king’s commandment was rigorous, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that had taken up Shadrach, Meshach,"
Daniel,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste; he spoke and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to"
Daniel,3,25,"He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the"
Daniel,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the opening of the burning fiery furnace; he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come [hither]. Then"
Daniel,3,27,"And the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had had no power, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them."
Daniel,3,28,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and who changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God!"
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree, that in every people, nation, and language, he who shall speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and his house"
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,4,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth:"
Daniel,4,2,It hath seemed good unto me to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me.
Daniel,4,3,"How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation. Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream of a Great Tree"
Daniel,4,4,"I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace."
Daniel,4,5,I saw a dream which made

Daniel,4,7,"Then came in the scribes, the magicians, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation"
Daniel,4,8,"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name"
Daniel,4,9,"O Belteshazzar, master of the scribes, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret is too hard for thee, tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen, and the interpretation of it."
Daniel,4,10,"Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached unto the heavens, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth."
Daniel,4,12,"Its leaves were beautiful, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it."
Daniel,4,13,"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the heavens; 14he cried aloud, and said thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts get away from under it, and the birds from its branches."
Daniel,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be bathed with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth."
Daniel,4,16,"Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him."
Daniel,4,17,"This sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the decision by the word of the holy ones: that the living may know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men."
Daniel,4,18,"This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, Belteshazzar, tell the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. Daniel Interprets the Second Dream"
Daniel,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, nor its interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and its interpretation"
Daniel,4,20,"The tree that thou sawest, which grew and was strong, whose height reached unto the heavens, and the sight of it to all the earth; 21whose leaves were beautiful, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and in whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation: 22it is thou, O king, who art grown and become strong; for thy"
Daniel,4,23,"And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the heavens, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be bathed with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him: 24this is the interpretation, O"
Daniel,4,25,"They shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and thou shalt be bathed with the dew of heaven; and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will."
Daniel,4,26,And whereas it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom shall remain
Daniel,4,27,"Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity. The Second Dream Fulfilled"
Daniel,4,28,All this came upon king Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,4,29,"At the end of twelve months he was walking upon the royal palace of Babylon: 30the king spoke and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the"
Daniel,4,31,"While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from the heavens: King Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee; 32and they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever"
Daniel,4,33,"The same hour was the word fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen; and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, till his hair grew like eagles’ [feathers], and his nails like birds’ [claws]. Nebuchadnezzar Restored"
Daniel,4,34,"And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto the heavens, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,35,"And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of the heavens, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?"
Daniel,4,36,"At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my nobles sought me; and I was"
Daniel,4,37,"Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of the heavens, all whose works are truth, and his paths judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase."

Daniel,8,3,"And I lifted up mine eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; and one was higher than the other,"
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward, and no beast could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; and he did according to his will, and became great."
Daniel,8,5,"And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth,"

Daniel,11,37,"And he will not regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women; nor regard any +god: for he will magnify himself above"
Daniel,11,38,And in his place will he honour the +god of fortresses; and a +god whom his fathers knew not
Daniel,11,39,"And he will practise in the strongholds of fortresses with a strange +god: whoso acknowledgeth him will he increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over the many, and shall divide the land [to them] for a reward."
Daniel,11,40,"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he"
Daniel,11,41,"And he shall enter into the land of beauty, and many [countries] shall be overthrown; but these shall escape out of his hand: Edom, and"
Daniel,11,42,And he shall stretch forth his hand upon the countries;
Daniel,11,43,"And he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his"
Daniel,11,44,But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; and he shall go forth with
Daniel,11,45,"And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the mountain of holy beauty; and he shall come to his end, and there shall be none to help him."
Daniel,12,1,"And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of distress, such as never was since there was a nation until that time. And"
Daniel,12,2,"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame, to"
Daniel,12,3,And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the expanse; and they
Daniel,12,4,"And thou, Daniel, close the words, and seal the book, till the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."
Daniel,12,5,"And I Daniel looked, and behold, there stood other two, the one on this side, on the bank of the river,"
Daniel,12,6,"And he said to the man clothed in linen, who was"
Daniel,12,7,"And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river; and he held up his right hand and his left hand unto the heavens, and swore by him that liveth for ever that it is for a time, times, and a half; and when the scattering of the power of the holy people shall be accomplished, all these things shall be"
Daniel,12,8,"And I heard, but I understood not. And I said, My lord, what shall be the end of these things?"
Daniel,12,9,"And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for these words are closed and sealed till the time of the end."
Daniel,12,10,"Many shall be purified, and be made white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of"
Daniel,12,11,"And from the time that the continual [sacrifice] is taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, [there shall be] a thousand,"
Daniel,12,12,"Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred"
Daniel,12,13,"But do thou go thy way until the end; and thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days."
Hosea,1,1,"The word of Jehovah that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel."
Hosea,1,2,"The beginning of the word of Jehovah through Hosea. And Jehovah said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms; for the land is entirely given up to whoredom, away"
Hosea,1,3,And he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived and bore
Hosea,1,4,"And Jehovah said unto him, Call his name Jizreel; for yet a little, and I will visit the blood"
Hosea,1,5,"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jizreel."
Hosea,1,6,"And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And he said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for"
Hosea,1,7,"But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by Jehovah their God; and I will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by battle, [or] by horses, or by horsemen."
Hosea,1,8,"And she weaned Lo-ruhamah; and she conceived and bore a son; 9and he said, Call his name Lo- ammi; for ye are not my people, and I will not be for you."
Hosea,1,10,"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured or numbered; and it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, Sons of the living God."
Hosea,1,11,"And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up out of the land: for great is the day of Jizreel."
Hosea,2,1,"Say unto your brethren Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah."
Hosea,2,2,"Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts; 3lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her as a dry land, and slay her with thirst."
Hosea,2,4,And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they are the children of whoredoms.
Hosea,2,5,"For their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give [me] my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink."
Hosea,2,6,"Therefore behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns; and I will fence [her] in with a wall, that she shall not find her paths."
Hosea,2,7,"And she shall pursue after her lovers, and shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, and shall not find them: and she shall say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then was it better with me than now."
Hosea,2,8,"And she did not know that I had given her the corn and the new wine and the oil, and had multiplied to her the silver and gold, which they employed for Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my new wine in its season, and will withdraw my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness."
Hosea,2,10,"And now will I discover her impiety in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand."
Hosea,2,11,"And I will cause all her mirth to cease: her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths! and all her solemnities."
Hosea,2,12,"And I will make desolate her vine and her fig-tree, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards which my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them."
Hosea,2,13,"And I will visit upon her the days of the Baals, wherein she burned incense to them, and decked herself with her rings and jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith Jehovah. God’s Mercy to Israel"
Hosea,2,14,"Therefore behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart."
Hosea,2,15,"And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"And it shall be in that day, saith Jehovah, [that] thou shalt call me, My husband, and shalt call me no more, Baali; 17for I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name."
Hosea,2,18,"And I will make a covenant for them in that day with the beasts of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground; and I will break bow and sword and battle out of the land; and I will make them to lie down safely."
Hosea,2,19,"And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; and I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies; 20and I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know Jehovah."
Hosea,2,21,"And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith Jehovah, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; 22and the earth shall hear the corn, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jizreel."
Hosea,2,23,"And I will sow her unto me in the land; and I will have mercy upon Lo-ruhamah; and I will say to Lo- ammi, Thou art my people; and they shall say, My God."
Hosea,3,1,"And Jehovah said unto me, Go again, love a woman beloved of a friend, and an adulteress, according to the love of Jehovah for the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love raisin-cakes."
Hosea,3,2,"So I bought her to me for fifteen silver [pieces], and for a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley."
Hosea,3,3,"And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt"
Hosea,3,4,"For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without statue, and without ephod and"
Hosea,3,5,"Afterwards shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king; and shall turn with fear toward Jehovah and toward his goodness, at the end of the days."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land; for there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land."
Hosea,4,2,"Swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery,—they break out; and blood toucheth blood."
Hosea,4,3,"For this shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away."
Hosea,4,4,"Yet let no man strive, and let no man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest."
Hosea,4,5,And thou shalt stumble by day; and the prophet also shall stumble with thee by night: and I will destroy thy mother.
Hosea,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; for thou hast rejected knowledge, and I will reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children."
Hosea,4,7,"As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame."
Hosea,4,8,"They eat the sin of my people, and their soul longeth for their iniquity."
Hosea,4,9,"And it shall be as the people so the priest; and I will visit their ways upon them, and recompense to them their doings; 10and they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: for they have left off taking heed to Jehovah."
Hosea,4,11,"Fornication, and wine, and new wine take away the heart."
Hosea,4,12,"My people ask counsel of their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of whoredoms causeth [them] to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God: 13they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oak and poplar and terebinth, because the shade thereof is good; therefore your daughters play the harlot and your daughters-in-law commit adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your daughters-in-law for their committing adultery; for they themselves go aside with harlots, and they sacrifice with prostitutes: and the people that doth not understand shall come to ruin."
Hosea,4,15,"Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, let not Judah trespass; and come ye not unto Gilgal, neither go up to Beth-aven, nor swear [As] Jehovah liveth!"
Hosea,4,16,For Israel is refractory as an untractable heifer; now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a wide [pasture].
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim is joined to idols: leave him alone.
Hosea,4,18,Their drink is sour; they give themselves up to whoredom; her great men passionately love [their] shame.
Hosea,4,19,"The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices."
Hosea,5,1,"Hear this, ye priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ear, O house of the king: for this judgment is for you; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor."
Hosea,5,2,"And they have plunged themselves in the corruption of apostasy, but I will be a chastiser of them all."
Hosea,5,3,"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, Ephraim, thou hast committed whoredom; Israel is defiled."
Hosea,5,4,"Their doings do not allow them to return unto their God; for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they know not Jehovah."
Hosea,5,5,And Israel’s pride doth testify to his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall fall by their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them.
Hosea,5,6,They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find [him]: he hath withdrawn himself from them.
Hosea,5,7,"They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have begotten strange children: now shall the new moon devour them, with their allotted possessions."
Hosea,5,8,"Blow the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah; cry aloud [at] Beth-aven: behind thee, O Benjamin!"
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim shall be a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which is sure.
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Judah are become like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, because in selfwill he walked after the commandment [of man]."
Hosea,5,12,"And I will be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness."
Hosea,5,13,"When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his sore, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb; but he was unable to heal you, nor hath he removed your sore."
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah. I, I will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver."
Hosea,5,15,"I will go away, I will return to my place, till they acknowledge their trespass, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early."
Hosea,6,1,"Come and let us return unto Jehovah: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up."
Hosea,6,2,"After two days will he revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before his face; 3and we shall know,—we shall follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is assured as the morning dawn; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain which watereth the earth."
Hosea,6,4,"What shall I do unto thee, Ephraim? What shall I do unto thee, Judah? For your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that early passeth away."
Hosea,6,5,Therefore have I hewed [them] by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and my judgment goeth forth as the light.
Hosea,6,6,"For I delight in loving-kindness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt- offerings."
Hosea,6,7,But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
Hosea,6,8,Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is tracked with blood.
Hosea,6,9,"And as troops of robbers lie in wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way of Shechem; yea, they commit lewdness."
Hosea,6,10,In the house of Israel have I seen a horrible thing: the whoredom of Ephraim is there; Israel is defiled.
Hosea,6,11,"Also, for thee, Judah, is a harvest appointed, when I shall turn again the captivity of my people."
Hosea,7,1,"When I would heal Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim is discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they practise falsehood; and the thief entereth in, [and] the troop of robbers assaileth without."
Hosea,7,2,And they say not in their hearts [that] I remember all their wickedness: now do their own doings encompass them; they are before my face.
Hosea,7,3,"They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies."
Hosea,7,4,"They all practise adultery, as an oven heated by the baker: he ceaseth from stirring [the fire] after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened."
Hosea,7,5,"In the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine: he stretched out his hand to scorners."
Hosea,7,6,For they have applied their heart like an oven to their lying in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth like a flaming fire.
Hosea,7,7,"They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me."
Hosea,7,8,"Ephraim, he mixeth himself with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned."
Hosea,7,9,"Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth [it] not; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth [it] not."
Hosea,7,10,"And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face; and they do not return to Jehovah their God, nor seek him for all this."
Hosea,7,11,"And Ephraim is become like a silly dove without understanding: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria."
Hosea,7,12,"When they go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowl of the heavens; I will chastise them, according as their assembly hath heard."
Hosea,7,13,Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have transgressed against me. And I would redeem them; but they speak lies against me.
Hosea,7,14,"And they cried not unto me in their heart, when they howled upon their beds; they assemble themselves for corn and new wine; they have turned aside from me."
Hosea,7,15,"I have indeed trained, I have strengthened their arms, but they imagine mischief against me."
Hosea,7,16,"They return, [but] not to the [Most] High: they are like a deceitful bow. Their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt."
Hosea,8,1,"Set the trumpet to thy mouth. [He cometh] as an eagle against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed my covenant, and rebelled against my law."
Hosea,8,2,"They shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee; [we], Israel."
Hosea,8,3,Israel hath cast off good: the enemy shall pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,"They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not; of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off."
Hosea,8,5,"Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast [thee] off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will they be incapable of purity?"
Hosea,8,6,"For from Israel is this also:—a workman made it, and it is no God: for the calf of Samaria shall be [broken in] pieces."
Hosea,8,7,"For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk; should it sprout, it would yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up."
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up: now are they become among the nations as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.
Hosea,8,9,For they are gone up [to] Assyria [as] a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.
Hosea,8,10,"Although they hire among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall begin to be straitened under the burden of the king of princes."
Hosea,8,11,"Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin."
Hosea,8,12,I have prescribed unto him the manifold things of my law: they are counted [as] a strange thing.
Hosea,8,13,"They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; Jehovah hath no delight in them. Now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof."
Hosea,9,1,"Rejoice not, Israel, exultingly, as the peoples; for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved harlot’s hire upon every corn-floor."
Hosea,9,2,"The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her."
Hosea,9,3,"They shall not dwell in Jehovah’s land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and in Assyria shall they eat that which is unclean."
Hosea,9,4,"They shall pour out no [offerings of] wine to Jehovah, neither shall their sacrifices be pleasing unto him: they shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be defiled: for their bread shall be for themselves; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah."
Hosea,9,5,"What will ye do in the day of assembly, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah?"
Hosea,9,6,"For behold, they are gone away because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Moph shall bury them: their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents."
Hosea,9,7,"The days of visitation are come; the days of recompence are come: Israel shall know [it]: the prophet is a fool, the inspired man is mad, because of the greatness of thine iniquity, and the great enmity."
Hosea,9,8,"Is Ephraim a watchman with my God? [nay] the prophet is a fowler’s snare on all his ways, enmity in the house of his God."
Hosea,9,9,"They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins."
Hosea,9,10,"I found Israel as grapes in the wilderness; as first-ripe fruit on the fig-tree, I saw your fathers at the beginning: they went to Baal-Peor, and separated themselves unto that shame, and became abominations like their lover."
Hosea,9,11,"As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away as a bird,—no birth, no pregnancy, no conception!"
Hosea,9,12,"For even should they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, [that] not a man [remain]: for woe also to them when I shall have departed from them!"
Hosea,9,13,"Ephraim, as I saw [him], was a Tyre planted in a beautiful place; but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the slayer."
Hosea,9,14,"Give them, Jehovah—what wilt thou give?—give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts."
Hosea,9,15,"All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings, I will drive them out of my house, I will love them no more: all their princes are rebellious."
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim is smitten: their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit; yea, though they should bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved [fruit] of their womb."
Hosea,9,17,"My God hath rejected them, because they hearkened not unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations."
Hosea,10,1,"Israel is an unpruned vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the abundance of his fruit he hath multiplied altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly statues."
Hosea,10,2,"Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he will break down their altars, he will destroy their statues."
Hosea,10,3,"For now they will say, We have no king, for we feared not Jehovah; and a king, what can he do for us?"
Hosea,10,4,"They speak [mere] words, swearing falsely in making a covenant; therefore shall judgment spring up as hemlock in the furrows of the fields."
Hosea,10,5,"The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calf of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the idolatrous priests thereof shall tremble for it, for its glory, because it is departed from it."
Hosea,10,6,"Yea, it shall be carried unto Assyria [as] a present for king Jareb: Ephraim shall be seized with shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel."
Hosea,10,7,As for Samaria her king is cut off as chips upon the face of the waters.
Hosea,10,8,"And the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up upon their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us! and to the hills, Fall on us!"
Hosea,10,9,"From the days of Gibeah hast thou sinned, O Israel: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them."
Hosea,10,10,"At my pleasure will I chastise them; and the peoples shall be assembled against them, when they are bound for their two iniquities."
Hosea,10,11,"And Ephraim is a trained heifer, that loveth to tread out [the corn]; I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to draw; Judah shall plough, Jacob shall break his clods."
Hosea,10,12,"Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek Jehovah, till he come and rain righteousness upon you."
Hosea,10,13,"Ye have ploughed wickedness, reaped iniquity, eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst confide in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men."
Hosea,10,14,"And a tumult shall arise among thy peoples, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with the children."
Hosea,10,15,So shall Bethel do unto you because of the wickedness of your wickedness: at day-break shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.
Hosea,11,1,"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son."
Hosea,11,2,"As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baals, and burned incense to graven images."
Hosea,11,3,"And I it was that taught Ephraim to walk,—He took them upon his arms,—but they knew not that I healed them."
Hosea,11,4,"I drew them with bands of a man, with cords of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I gently caused them to eat."
Hosea,11,5,"He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king; for they refused to return [to me]; 6and the sword shall turn about in his cities, and shall consume his bars, and devour [them], because of their own counsels."
Hosea,11,7,"Yea, my people are bent upon backsliding from me: though they call them to the Most High, none at all exalteth [him]. God’s Love for Israel"
Hosea,11,8,"How shall I give thee over, Ephraim? [how] shall I deliver thee up, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? [how] shall I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together."
Hosea,11,9,"I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God, and not man,—the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not come in anger."
Hosea,11,10,"They shall walk after Jehovah; he shall roar like a lion; when he shall roar, then the children shall hasten from the west: 11they shall hasten as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will cause them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah."
Hosea,11,12,"Ephraim encompasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet walketh with God, and with the holy things of truth."
Hosea,12,1,"Ephraim feedeth on wind, and pursueth after the east wind: all day long he multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt."
Hosea,12,2,"Jehovah hath also a controversy with Judah, and he will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him."
Hosea,12,3,"He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and in his strength he wrestled with God."
Hosea,12,4,"Yea, he wrestled with the Angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us, 5—even Jehovah, the God of hosts,—Jehovah is his memorial."
Hosea,12,6,"And thou, return unto thy God: keep loving-kindness and judgment, and wait on thy God continually. 7[He is] a merchant, balances of deceit are in his hand; he loveth to oppress."
Hosea,12,8,"And Ephraim saith, Nevertheless I am become rich, I have found me out substance; in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin."
Hosea,12,9,"But I [that am] Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt will again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast."
Hosea,12,10,"And I have spoken to the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and by means of the prophets have I used similitudes."
Hosea,12,11,"If Gilead is iniquity, surely they are but vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields."
Hosea,12,12,"And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept [sheep]."
Hosea,12,13,"And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved."
Hosea,12,14,"Ephraim provoked [him] to anger most bitterly; and his Lord shall leave his blood upon him, and recompense unto him his reproach."

Micah,7,1,"Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer-fruits, as the grape-gleanings of the vintage. There is no cluster to eat; there is no early fruit [which] my soul desired."
Micah,7,2,"The godly [man] hath perished out of the land, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood, they hunt every man his brother with a net."
Micah,7,3,"Both hands are for evil, to do it well. The prince asketh, and the judge [is there] for a reward; and the great [man] uttereth his soul’s greed: and [together] they combine it."
Micah,7,4,"The best of them is as a briar; the most upright, [worse] than a thorn-fence. The day of thy watchmen, thy visitation is come; now shall be their perplexity."
Micah,7,5,"Believe ye not in a companion, put not confidence in a familiar friend: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom."

Nahum,1,7,"Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him."
Nahum,1,8,"But with an overrunning flood he will make a full end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies."
Nahum,1,9,What do ye imagine against Jehovah? He will make a full end: trouble shall not rise up the second time.
Nahum,1,10,"Though they be tangled together [as] thorns, and be as drenched from their drink, they shall be devoured as dry stubble, completely."

Nahum,2,13,"Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts: and I will burn her chariots into smoke; and the sword shall devour thy young lions, and I will cut off thy prey from the earth; and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard."

Nahum,3,16,Thou hast multiplied thy merchants more than the stars of the heavens; the cankerworm spreadeth himself out and flieth away.
Nahum,3,17,"Thy chosen men are as the locusts, and thy captains as swarms of grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day: when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are."
Nahum,3,18,"Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; thy nobles lie still; thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth them."

Habakkuk,1,1,The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
Habakkuk,1,2,"Jehovah, how long shall I cry and thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto thee, Violence! and thou dost not save."
Habakkuk,1,3,"Why dost thou cause me to see iniquity, and lookest thou upon grievance? For spoiling and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up."
Habakkuk,1,4,"Therefore the law is powerless, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked encompasseth the righteous; therefore judgment goeth forth perverted. The LORD’s Answer"
Habakkuk,1,5,"See ye among the nations, and behold, and wonder marvellously; for [I] work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be declared [to you]."
Habakkuk,1,6,"For behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and impetuous nation, which marcheth through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs."
Habakkuk,1,7,They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.
Habakkuk,1,8,"And their horses are swifter than the leopards, and are more agile than the evening wolves; and their horsemen prance proudly, and their horsemen come from afar: they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour."
Habakkuk,1,9,"They come all of them for violence: the crowd of their faces is forwards, and they gather captives as the sand."
Habakkuk,1,10,"Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a scorn unto him; he derideth every stronghold: for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it."
Habakkuk,1,11,"Then will his mind change, and he will pass on, and become guilty: this his power is become his +god. Habakkuk’s Second Complaint (Psalm 11:1–7) 12—Art thou not from everlasting, Jehovah my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. Jehovah, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast appointed him for correction. 13[Thou art] of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on mischief: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, [and] keepest silence when the wicked swalloweth up a [man] more righteous than he?"
Habakkuk,1,14,"And thou makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them."
Habakkuk,1,15,"He taketh up all of them with the hook, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them into his drag; therefore he rejoiceth and is glad: 16therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; for by them his portion is become fat, and his meat dainty."
Habakkuk,1,17,"Shall he therefore empty his net, and not spare to slay the nations continually?"
Habakkuk,2,1,"I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look forth to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer as to my reproof."
Habakkuk,2,2,"And Jehovah answered me and said, Write the vision, and engrave it upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it."
Habakkuk,2,3,"For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but it hasteth to the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; for it will surely come, it will not delay."
Habakkuk,2,4,"Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright within him: but the just shall live by his faith."
Habakkuk,2,5,"And moreover, the wine is treacherous: he is a proud man, and keepeth not at rest, he enlargeth his desire as Sheol, and he is like death and cannot be satisfied; and he assembleth unto him all nations, and gathereth unto him all peoples. Woe to the Chaldeans"
Habakkuk,2,6,"Shall not all these take up a proverb about him, and a taunting riddle against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long?—and to him that loadeth himself with pledges!"
Habakkuk,2,7,"Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and they awake up that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?"
Habakkuk,2,8,"Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the rest of the peoples shall plunder thee; because of men’s blood, and for the violence [done] to the land, to the city, and all that dwell therein."
Habakkuk,2,9,"Woe to him that getteth iniquitous gain to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the grasp of evil!"
Habakkuk,2,10,"Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast sinned against thine own soul."
Habakkuk,2,11,"For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it."
Habakkuk,2,12,"Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by unrighteousness!"
Habakkuk,2,13,"Behold, is it not of Jehovah of hosts that the peoples labour for the fire, and the nations weary themselves in vain?"
Habakkuk,2,14,For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.
Habakkuk,2,15,"Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink,—that pourest out thy flask, and makest [him] drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!"
Habakkuk,2,16,"Thou art filled with shame instead of glory; drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of Jehovah’s right hand shall be turned unto thee, and a shameful spewing shall be on thy glory."
Habakkuk,2,17,"For the violence [done] to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of beasts which made them afraid; because of men’s blood, and for the violence [done] to the land, to the city, and all that dwell therein."
Habakkuk,2,18,"What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it? the molten image, and the teacher of falsehood, that the maker of his work dependeth thereon, to make dumb idols?"
Habakkuk,2,19,"Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake! to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall it teach? Behold it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it."
Habakkuk,2,20,But Jehovah is in his holy temple. Let all the earth keep silence before him!
Habakkuk,3,1,A Prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
Habakkuk,3,2,"Jehovah, I heard the report of thee, [and] I feared. Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make [it] known: In wrath remember mercy!"
Habakkuk,3,3,"God came from Teman, And the holy one from mount Paran. Selah. his glory covereth the heavens, And the earth is full of his praise."
Habakkuk,3,4,And [his] brightness was as the light; Rays [came forth] from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.
Habakkuk,3,5,"Before him went the pestilence, And a burning flame went forth at his feet."
Habakkuk,3,6,"He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and discomfited the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered, The everlasting hills gave way: His ways are everlasting."
Habakkuk,3,7,I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
Habakkuk,3,8,"Was Jehovah wrathful with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers? Was thy rage against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Thy chariots of salvation?"
Habakkuk,3,9,"Thy bow was made naked, The rods [of discipline] sworn according to [thy] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers."
Habakkuk,3,10,"The mountains saw thee, they were in travail: Torrents of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, Lifted up its hands on high."
Habakkuk,3,11,"The sun [and] moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows which shot forth,—At the shining of thy glittering spear."
Habakkuk,3,12,"Thou didst march through the land in indignation, Thou didst thresh the nations in anger."
Habakkuk,3,13,"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou didst smite off the head from the house of the wicked, Laying bare the foundation even to the neck. Selah."
Habakkuk,3,14,"Thou didst strike through with his own spears the head of his leaders: They came out as a whirlwind to scatter me, Whose exulting was as to devour the afflicted secretly."
Habakkuk,3,15,"Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses, The heap of great waters."
Habakkuk,3,16,"I heard, and my belly trembled; My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my place, That I might rest in the day of distress, When their invader shall come up against the people. Habakkuk Rejoices"
Habakkuk,3,17,"For though the fig-tree shall not blossom, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labour of the olive- tree shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:"
Habakkuk,3,18,"Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation."
Habakkuk,3,19,"Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength, And he maketh my feet like hinds’ [feet], And he will make me to walk upon my high places. To the chief Musician. On my stringed instruments."

Zephaniah,1,4,"And I will stretch forth my hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, the name of the Chemarim with the priests; 5and them that bow down to the host of the heavens upon the housetops; and them that bow down to Jehovah, that swear by [him], and swear by Malcham; 6and them that turn back from after Jehovah, and that do not seek Jehovah, nor inquire for him.

Zephaniah,1,11,"Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh; for all the people of Canaan are cut down, all they that are laden with silver are cut off."

Zephaniah,1,15,"That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of ruin and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and gross darkness, 16a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fenced cities and against the high battlements."
Zephaniah,1,17,"And I will bring distress upon men, and they shall walk like blind men; for they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung: 18their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them, in the day of Jehovah’s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for a full end, yea, a sudden [end], shall he make of all them that dwell in the land."
Zephaniah,2,1,"Collect yourselves and gather together, O nation without shame, 2before the decree bring forth, [before] the day pass away as chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah’s anger come upon you."

Zephaniah,2,4,"For Gazah shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon shall be a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up."
Zephaniah,2,5,"Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant; 6and the sea-coast shall be cave-dwellings for shepherds, and folds for flocks."
Zephaniah,2,7,"And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for Jehovah their God shall visit them, and turn again their captivity. Judgment on Moab and Ammon (Isaiah 16:1–14; Jeremiah 48:1–47)"
Zephaniah,2,8,"I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border."

Zephaniah,2,15,"This is the rejoicing city that dwelt in security, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none else beside me: how is she become a desolation, a couching-place for beasts! Every one that passeth by her shall hiss, shall wave his hand."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Woe to her that is rebellious and corrupted, to the oppressing city!"
Zephaniah,3,2,She hearkened not to the voice; she received not correction; she confided not in Jehovah; she drew not near her God.
Zephaniah,3,3,"Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves, that leave nothing for the morning."
Zephaniah,3,4,"Her prophets are vain-glorious, treacherous persons; her priests profane the sanctuary, they do violence to the law."

Zephaniah,3,6,"I have cut off nations: their battlements are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant."
Zephaniah,3,7,"I said, Only fear me, receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, howsoever I may punish her. But they rose early, they corrupted all their doings."
Zephaniah,3,8,"Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to assemble the nations, that I may gather the kingdoms together, to pour upon them mine indignation,—all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.

Zechariah,10,1,"Ask of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain; Jehovah will make lightnings, and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field."
Zechariah,10,2,"For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams: they comfort in vain. Therefore they have gone away as a flock, they are in distress, because there is no shepherd."
Zechariah,10,3,"Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of hosts visiteth his flock, the house of Judah, and maketh them as his majestic horse in the battle."

John,5,16,"And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus [and sought to kill him], because he had done these things"
John,5,17,"But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto and I work."
John,5,18,"For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he had not only violated the sabbath, but also said that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God."

He who honours not the Son, honours not the Father who has sent him."
John,5,24,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he that hears my word, and believes him that has sent me, has life eternal, and does not come into judgment, but is passed out of death into life."
John,5,25,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, that an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice"
John,5,26,"For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself, 27and has given him authority to execute judgment"
John,5,28,"Wonder not at this, for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice, 29and shall go forth; those that have practised good, to resurrection of life, and those that have done evil, to resurrection of judgment."
John,5,30,"I cannot do anything of myself; as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I do not seek my will, but the will of him that has sent me. Testimonies about Jesus"
John,5,31,"If I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is not true."
John,5,32,"It is another who bears witness concerning me, and I know that the witness which he bears concerning me is true."
John,5,33,"Ye have sent unto John, and he has borne witness to the truth."
John,5,34,But I do not receive witness from
John,5,35,"He was the burning and shining lamp, and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light."
John,5,36,"But I have the witness [that is] greater than [that] of John; for the works which the Father has given me that I should complete them, the works themselves which I do, bear witness concerning me that the Father has sent me."
John,5,37,"And the Father who has sent me himself has borne witness concerning me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor have seen his shape, 38and ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom he hath sent, him ye do not believe. The Witness of Scripture (Luke 16:19–31)"

John,7,11,"The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?"
John,7,12,"And there was much murmuring concerning him among the crowds. Some said, He is [a] good [man]; others said, No; but"
John,7,13,"However, no one spoke openly concerning him on account of [their] fear of the Jews."

John,11,11,"These things said he; and after this he says to them, Lazarus, our friend, is fallen asleep, but I go that I may awake"
John,11,12,"The disciples therefore said to him, Lord, if he be fallen asleep, he will get well."

John,12,9,"A great crowd therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not because of Jesus"

John,12,39,"On this account they could not believe, because Esaias said"
John,12,40,"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they may not see with their eyes,"

John,12,42,"Although indeed from among the rulers also many believed on him, but on account of the Pharisees did not confess [him], that they might not be put out of the synagogue: 43for they loved glory from men rather than glory from God."

The Verdict Postponed"
Acts,24,22,"And Felix, knowing accurately the things concerning the way, adjourned them, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch is come down I will determine your affair; 23ordering the centurion to keep him, and that he should have freedom, and to hinder none of his friends to minister to him."

Acts,25,13,"And when certain days had elapsed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to salute"
Acts,25,14,"And when they had spent many days there, Festus laid before the king the matters relating to Paul, saying, There is a certain man left prisoner by Felix, 15concerning whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid informations, requiring judgment against him: 16to whom I answered, It is not [the] custom of the Romans to give up any man before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and he have got opportunity of defence touching the charge."
Acts,25,17,"When therefore they had come together here, without putting it off, I sat the next day on the judgment-seat and commanded the man to be brought: 18concerning whom the accusers, standing up, brought no such accusation of guilt as I supposed; 19but had against him certain questions of their own system of worship, and concerning a certain Jesus who is dead, whom Paul affirmed to be living."

Wherefore I have brought him before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, so that an examination having been gone into I may have something to write: 27for it seems to me senseless, sending a prisoner, not also to signify the charges against him."
Acts,26,1,"And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching out his hand answered in his defence:"
Acts,26,2,"I count myself happy, king Agrippa, in having to answer to-day before thee concerning all of which I am accused by the Jews, 3especially because thou art acquainted with all the customs and questions which are among the Jews; wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently."

Acts,26,15,"And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: 16but rise up and stand on thy feet; for, for this purpose have I appeared to thee, to appoint thee to be a servant and a witness both of what thou hast seen, and of what I shall appear to thee in, 17taking thee out from among the people, and the nations, to whom I send thee, 18to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me."

Romans,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the glad tidings; for it is God’s power to salvation, to every one that believes, both to Jew first and to Greek: 17for righteousness of God is revealed therein, on the principle of faith, to faith: according as it is written, But the just shall live by faith.

Romans,1,21,"Because, knowing God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but fell into folly in their thoughts, and their heart without understanding was darkened: 22professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 23and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into [the] likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles."
Romans,1,24,"Wherefore God gave them up [also] in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies between themselves: 25who changed the truth of God into falsehood, and honoured and served the creature more than him who had created [it], who is blessed for ever. Amen."
Romans,1,26,"For this reason God gave them up to vile lusts; for both their females changed the natural use into that contrary to nature; 27and in like manner the males also, leaving the natural use of the female, were inflamed in their lust towards one another; males with males working shame, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was fit."
Romans,1,28,"And according as they did not think good to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind to practise unseemly things; 29being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil dispositions; whisperers, 30back-biters, hateful to God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31void of understanding, faithless, without natural affection, unmerciful; 32who knowing the righteous judgment of God, that they who do such things are worthy of death, not only practise them, but have fellow delight in those who do [them]."

Romans,3,1,What then [is] the superiority of the Jew? or what the profit of circumcision?

There Is No One Righteous (Psalm 14:1–7; Psalm 53:1–6; Isaiah 59:1–17)"
Romans,3,9,"What then? are we better? No, in no wise: for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin: 10according as it is written, There is not a righteous [man], not even one; 11there is not the [man] that understands, there is not one that seeks after God."
Romans,3,12,"All have gone out of the way, they have together become unprofitable; there is not one that practises goodness, there is not so much as one: 13their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; asps’ poison [is] under their lips: 14whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; 15swift their feet to shed blood; 16ruin and misery [are] in their ways, 17and way of peace they have not known: 18there is no fear of God before their eyes."
Romans,3,19,"Now we know that whatever the things the law says, it speaks to those under the law, that every"
Romans,3,20,Wherefore by works of law no flesh shall be justified before him; for by law [is] knowledge of sin. Righteousness through Faith in Christ (Philippians 3:1–11)
Romans,3,21,"But now without law righteousness of God is manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets; 22righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all, and upon all those who believe: for there is no difference; 23for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 24being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which [is] in Christ Jesus; 25whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood, for [the] shewing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God; 26for [the] shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just, and justify him that is of [the] faith of Jesus."
Romans,3,27,"Where then [is] boasting? It has been excluded. By what law? of works? Nay, but by law of faith;"
Romans,3,29,"Is [God] the God of Jews only? is he not of [the] nations also? Yea, of nations also: 30since indeed [it is] one God who shall justify [the] circumcision on the principle of faith, and uncircumcision by faith."
Romans,3,31,"Do we then make void law by faith? Far be the thought: [no,] but we establish law."
Romans,4,1,What shall we say then that Abraham our father according to flesh has found?
Romans,4,2,"For if Abraham has been justified on the principle of works, he has whereof to boast: but not before God; 3for what does"
Romans,4,4,"Now to him that works the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but of debt: 5but to him who does not work,"
Romans,4,6,Even as David also declares the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness without works:
Romans,4,7,"Blessed [they] whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered: 8blessed [the] man to whom [the] Lord shall not at all reckon sin. 9[Does] this blessedness then [rest] on the circumcision, or also on the uncircumcision? For we say"
Romans,4,10,How then has it been reckoned? when
Romans,4,11,"And he received [the] sign of circumcision [as] seal of the righteousness of faith which [he had] being in uncircumcision, that he might be [the] father of all them that believe being in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned to them also; 12and father of circumcision, not only to those who are of [the] circumcision, but to those also who walk in the steps of the faith, during uncircumcision, of our father Abraham. Abraham Receives the Promise (Genesis 15:8–21)"
Romans,4,13,"For [it was] not by law that the promise was to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of"
Romans,4,14,"For if they which [are] of law be heirs, faith is made vain,"
Romans,4,15,For law works wrath; but where no law is neither [is there] transgression.
Romans,4,16,"Therefore [it is] on the principle of faith, that [it might be] according to grace, in order to the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that only which [is] of the law, but to that also which [is] of Abraham’s faith, who is father of us all, 17(according as it is written, I have made thee father of many nations,) before the God whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls the things which be not as being; 18who against hope believed in hope to his becoming father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be: 19and not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body already become dead, being about a hundred years old, and the deadening of Sarah’s womb, 20and hesitated not at the promise of God through unbelief; but found strength in faith, giving glory to God; 21and being fully persuaded that what he has promised he is able also to do; 22wherefore also it was"
Romans,4,23,"Now it was not written on his account alone that it was reckoned to him, 24but on ours also, to whom, believing on him who has raised from among [the] dead Jesus our Lord, 25who has been delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification, it will be reckoned."
Romans,5,1,"Therefore having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ; 2by whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand, and we"
Romans,5,3,"And not only [that], but we also boast in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works endurance; 4and endurance, experience; and experience, hope; 5and hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by [the] Holy Spirit which has been given to us: Christ’s Sacrifice for the Ungodly (John 3:1–21)"
Romans,5,7,"For scarcely for [the] just [man] will one die, for perhaps for [the] good [man] some one might also dare to die;"
Romans,5,9,"Much rather therefore, having been now justified in [the power of] his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath."
Romans,5,10,"For if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much rather,"
Romans,5,11,"And not only [that], but [we are] making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation. Death in Adam, Life in Christ (Genesis 3:1–7)"
Romans,5,12,"For this [cause], even as by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death; and thus death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 13(for until law sin was in [the] world; but sin is not put to account when there is no law; 14but death reigned from Adam until Moses, even upon those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is [the] figure of him to come."
Romans,5,15,"But [shall] not the act of favour [be] as the offence? For if by the offence of one the many have died, much rather has the grace of God, and the free gift in grace, which [is] by the one man Jesus Christ,"
Romans,5,16,And [shall] not as by one that has sinned [be] the gift? For the judgment
Romans,5,17,"For if by the offence of the one death reigned by the one, much rather shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness, reign in life by the one Jesus Christ:) 18so then as [it was] by one offence towards all men to condemnation, so by one righteousness towards"
Romans,5,19,"For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous."
Romans,5,20,"But law came in, in order that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded grace has overabounded, 21in order that, even as sin has reigned in [the power of] death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans,6,1,What then shall we say? Should we continue in sin that grace may abound?
Romans,6,2,Far be the thought. We
Romans,6,3,"Are you ignorant that we, as many as have been"
Romans,6,4,"We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among [the] dead"
Romans,6,5,"For if we are become identified with [him] in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of [his] resurrection; 6knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer"
Romans,6,7,For he that has died is justified from sin.
Romans,6,8,"Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him, 9knowing that Christ having been raised up from among [the] dead dies no more: death has dominion over him no more."
Romans,6,10,"For in that he has died, he has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God."
Romans,6,11,"So also ye, reckon yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus."
Romans,6,12,Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to obey its lusts.
Romans,6,13,"Neither yield your members instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but yield yourselves to God as alive from among [the] dead,"
Romans,6,14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under law but under grace. The Wages of Sin"
Romans,6,15,What then? should we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Far be the thought.
Romans,6,16,"Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves bondmen for obedience, ye are bondmen to him whom"
Romans,6,17,"But thanks [be] to God, that ye were bondmen of sin, but have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were"
Romans,6,18,"Now, having got your freedom from sin, ye have become bondmen to righteousness."
Romans,6,19,"I speak humanly on account of the weakness of your flesh. For even as ye have yielded your members in bondage to uncleanness and to lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now yield your members in bondage to righteousness unto holiness."
Romans,6,20,For when ye were bondmen of sin ye were free from righteousness.
Romans,6,21,What fruit therefore had ye
Romans,6,22,"But now, having got your freedom from sin, and having become bondmen to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and"
Romans,6,23,"For the wages of sin [is] death; but the act of favour of God, eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans,7,1,"Are ye ignorant, brethren, (for I speak to those knowing law,) that law rules over a man as long as"
Romans,7,2,"For the married woman is bound by law to her husband so long as he is alive; but if the husband should die, she is clear from the law of the husband: 3so then, the husband being alive, she shall be called an adulteress if she be to another man; but if the husband should die, she is free from the law, so as not to be an adulteress, though she be to another man."
Romans,7,4,"So that, my brethren, ye also have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ, to be to another, who has been raised up from among [the] dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God."
Romans,7,5,"For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins, which [were] by the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit to death; 6but now we are clear from the law, having died in that in which we were held, so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter. God’s Law Is Holy"
Romans,7,7,"What shall we say then? [is] the law sin? Far be the thought. But I had not known sin, unless by law: for I had not had conscience also of lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not lust; 8but sin, getting"
Romans,7,9,But
Romans,7,10,"And the commandment, which [was] for life, was found, [as] to me, itself [to be] unto death: 11for sin, getting"
Romans,7,12,"So that the law indeed [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Struggling with Sin"
Romans,7,13,"Did then that which is good become death to me? Far be the thought. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death to me by that which is good; in order that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."
Romans,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am fleshly, sold under sin."
Romans,7,15,"For that which I do, I do not"
Romans,7,16,"But if what I do not will, this I"
Romans,7,17,"Now then [it is] no longer I [that] do it, but the sin"
Romans,7,18,"For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell: for to will is there"
Romans,7,19,For I do not practise the good that I will; but the evil I do not
Romans,7,20,"But if what I do not will, this I practise, [it is] no longer I [that] do it, but the sin that dwells in me."
Romans,7,21,"I find then the law upon me who will to practise what is right, that with me evil is there."
Romans,7,22,"For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man: 23but I see another law in my members, warring in opposition to the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which exists in my"
Romans,7,24,O wretched man that I [am]! who shall deliver me out of this body of death?
Romans,7,25,"I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I myself with the mind serve God’s law; but with the flesh sin’s law."
Romans,8,2,For the law of the Spirit of life in
Romans,8,3,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh, 4in order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled"
Romans,8,5,For they that are according to flesh
Romans,8,6,For the
Romans,8,7,Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God; for neither indeed can it be: 8and they that are in flesh cannot please God.
Romans,8,9,"But ye are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God’s Spirit dwell in you; but if any one has not [the] Spirit of Christ he is not of him: 10but if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the"
Romans,8,11,"But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among [the] dead dwell in you, he that has raised up Christ from among [the] dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you. Heirs with Christ"
Romans,8,12,"So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh; 13for if ye live according to flesh, ye are about to die; but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live:"
Romans,8,15,"For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,"
Romans,8,16,"The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God."
Romans,8,17,"And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ’s joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with [him], that we may also be glorified with [him]. Future Glory (2 Corinthians 5:1–10)"
Romans,8,18,For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the coming
Romans,8,19,"For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God: 20for the creature has been made subject to vanity, not of its will, but by reason of him who has subjected [the same], in hope 21that the creature itself also shall be set free from the bondage"
Romans,8,22,For we know that the whole creation
Romans,8,23,"And not only [that], but even we ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, we also ourselves groan in ourselves, awaiting adoption, [that is]"
Romans,8,24,For we have been saved in hope; but hope seen is not hope; for what
Romans,8,25,"But if what we see not we hope, we expect in patience."
Romans,8,26,"And in like manner the Spirit joins also its help to our weakness; for we do not know what we should pray for as is fitting, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered."
Romans,8,27,"But he who searches the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for saints according to God. God Works in All Things (Ephesians 1:3–14)"
Romans,8,28,"But we do know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are"
Romans,8,29,"Because whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated [to be]"
Romans,8,30,"But whom he has predestinated, these also he has called; and whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified."
Romans,8,31,"What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us, who against us?"
Romans,8,32,"He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him grant us all things?"
Romans,8,33,"Who shall bring an accusation against God’s elect? [It is] God who justifies: 34who is he that condemns? [It is] Christ who has died, but rather has been [also] raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us. More than Conquerors (Psalm 44:1–26)"
Romans,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?"
Romans,8,36,"According as it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter."
Romans,8,37,But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us.
Romans,8,38,"For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, 39nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which [is] in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans,9,1,"I say [the] truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in [the] Holy Spirit, 2that I have great grief and uninterrupted pain in my heart, 3for I have wished, I myself, to be a curse from the Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to flesh; 4who are Israelites; whose [is] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the law-giving, and the service, and the promises; 5whose [are] the fathers; and of whom, as according to flesh, [is] the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. God’s Sovereign Choice (Genesis 25:19–28; Malachi 1:1–5)"
Romans,9,6,Not however as though the word of God had failed; for not all [are] Israel which [are] of Israel; 7nor

Romans,9,9,"For this word [is] of promise, According to this time I will come, and"
Romans,9,10,"And not only [that], but Rebecca having conceived by one, Isaac our father, 11[the children] indeed being not yet born, or having done anything good or worthless (that the purpose of God according to election might abide, not of works, but of him that calls), 12it was said to her, The greater shall serve the less: 13according as it is written, I have loved Jacob, and I have hated Esau."
Romans,9,14,What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God? Far be the thought.
Romans,9,15,"For he says to Moses, I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy, and I will feel compassion for whom I will feel"
Romans,9,16,"So then [it is] not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shews mercy."
Romans,9,17,"For the scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very thing I have raised thee up from amongst [men], that I might thus shew in thee my power, and so that my name should be declared in all the earth."
Romans,9,18,"So then, to whom he will he shews mercy, and whom he will he hardens."
Romans,9,19,"Thou wilt say to me then, Why does he yet find fault? for who resists his purpose?"
Romans,9,20,"Aye, but thou, O man, who art thou that answerest again to God? Shall the thing formed say to him that has formed"
Romans,9,21,"Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump"
Romans,9,22,"And if God, minded to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction; 23and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory, 24us, whom he has also called, not only from amongst [the] Jews, but also from amongst [the] nations?"
Romans,9,25,"As he says also in Hosea, I will call not-my-people My people; and the-not-beloved Beloved."
Romans,9,26,"And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, Ye [are] not my people, there shall they be called Sons of [the] living God."
Romans,9,27,"But Esaias cries concerning Israel, Should the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved: 28for [he] is bringing the matter to an end, and [cutting [it] short in righteousness; because] a cutting short of the matter will [the] Lord accomplish upon the earth."
Romans,9,29,"And according as Esaias said before, Unless [the] Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and made like even as Gomorrha. Israel’s Unbelief"
Romans,9,30,"What then shall we say? That [they of the] nations, who did not follow after righteousness, have"
Romans,9,31,"But Israel, pursuing"
Romans,9,32,"Wherefore? Because [it was] not on the principle of faith, but as of works. They have stumbled at the stumblingstone, 33according as it is written, Behold, I place in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and he that believes on him shall not be ashamed."
Romans,10,1,"Brethren, the delight of my own heart and my supplication which [I address] to God for them is for"

Romans,10,3,"For they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own [righteousness], have"
Romans,10,4,For Christ is [the] end of law for righteousness to every one that believes.
Romans,10,5,"For Moses lays down in writing the righteousness which is of the law, The man who has practised"
Romans,10,6,"But the righteousness of faith speaks thus: Do not say in thine heart, Who shall ascend to the heavens? that is, to bring Christ down; 7or, Who shall descend into the abyss?"
Romans,10,8,"But what says it? The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach: 9that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among [the]"
Romans,10,10,For with [the] heart is believed to righteousness; and with [the] mouth
Romans,10,11,"For the scripture says, No one believing on him shall be ashamed."
Romans,10,12,For there is no difference of Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all [is] rich towards all that call

Romans,10,14,"How then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without one who preaches? 15and how shall they preach unless they have been sent? according as it is written, How beautiful the feet of them that announce glad tidings of peace, of them that announce glad tidings of good things!"
Romans,10,16,"But they have not all obeyed the glad tidings. For Esaias says, Lord, who has believed our report?"
Romans,10,17,"So faith then [is] by a report, but the report by God’s word."
Romans,10,18,"But I say, Have they not heard? Yea, surely, Their voice has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the extremities of the habitable world."
Romans,10,19,"But I say, Has not Israel known? First, Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy through [them that are] not a nation: through a nation without understanding I will anger you."
Romans,10,20,"But Esaias is very bold, and says, I have been found by those not seeking me; I have become manifest to those not inquiring after me."
Romans,10,21,"But unto Israel he says, All the day long I have stretched out my hands unto a people disobeying and opposing."

Romans,11,2,"God has not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture says in [the history of] Elias, how he pleads with God against Israel?"

Romans,11,7,"What [is it] then? What Israel seeks for, that he has not obtained; but the election has obtained, and the rest have been blinded, 8according as it is written, God has given to them a spirit of slumber, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear, unto this day."
Romans,11,9,"And David says, Let their table be for a snare, and for a gin, and for a fall-trap, and for a recompense to them: 10let their eyes be darkened not to see, and bow down their back alway. The Ingrafting of the Gentiles"

Romans,11,12,"But if their fall [be the] world’s wealth,"

Romans,11,19,"Thou wilt say then, The branches have been broken out in order that I might be grafted in."
Romans,11,20,"Right: they have been broken out through unbelief, and thou standest through faith. Be not high- minded, but fear: 21if God indeed has not spared the natural branches; lest it might be he spare not"
Romans,11,22,"Behold then [the] goodness and severity of God: upon them who have fallen, severity; upon thee goodness of God, if thou shalt abide in goodness, since [otherwise] thou also wilt be cut"
Romans,11,23,"And they too, if they abide not in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able again to graft"
Romans,11,24,"For if thou hast been cut out of the olive tree wild by nature, and, contrary to nature, hast been grafted into the good olive tree, how much rather shall they, who are according to nature be grafted into their own olive tree? All Israel Will Be Saved"
Romans,11,25,"For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, that ye may not be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the nations be come in; 26and so all Israel shall be saved. According as it is written, The deliverer shall come out of Zion; he shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob."
Romans,11,27,"And this is the covenant from me to them, when I shall have taken away their sins."
Romans,11,28,"As regards the glad tidings, [they are] enemies on your account; but as regards election, beloved on"
Romans,11,29,For the gifts and the calling of God [are] not subject to repentance.

Romans,12,9,"Let love be unfeigned; abhorring evil; cleaving to good: 10as to brotherly love, kindly affectioned towards one another: as to honour, each taking the lead in paying it to the other: 11as to diligent"
Romans,12,12,"As regards hope, rejoicing: as regards tribulation, enduring: as regards prayer, persevering: 13distributing to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality. Forgiveness (Matthew 18:21–35)"

Romans,12,15,"Rejoice with those that rejoice, weep with"
Romans,12,16,"Have the same respect one for another, not minding high things, but going along with the lowly: be not wise in your own eyes: 17recompensing to no one evil for evil: providing things honest before all men: 18if possible, as far as depends on you, living in peace with all men; 19not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to wrath; for it is written, Vengeance [belongs] to me, I"
Romans,12,20,"If therefore thine enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst,"
Romans,12,21,"Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
Romans,13,1,Let every soul be subject to the authorities that are above [him]. For there is no authority except from
Romans,13,2,So that he that sets himself in opposition to the authority resists the ordinance of God; and they who [thus] resist shall bring sentence of guilt on themselves.
Romans,13,3,"For rulers are not a terror to a good work, but to an evil [one]. Dost thou desire then not to be afraid of the authority? practise [what is] good, and thou shalt have praise from it; 4for it is God’s minister to thee for good. But if thou practisest evil, fear; for it bears not the sword in vain; for it is God’s minister,"
Romans,13,5,"Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only on"
Romans,13,6,For on this account ye pay tribute also; for they
Romans,13,7,"Render to all their dues: to whom tribute [is due], tribute; to whom custom, custom; to whom fear, fear; to whom honour, honour. Love Fulfills the Law (Leviticus 19:9–18)"
Romans,13,8,"Owe no one anything, unless to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law."
Romans,13,9,"For, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not lust; and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour"
Romans,13,10,Love works no ill to its neighbour; love therefore [is the] whole law. The Day Is Near
Romans,13,11,"This also, knowing the time, that it is already time that we should be aroused out of sleep; for now"
Romans,13,12,"The night is far spent, and the day is near; let us"
Romans,13,13,"As in the day, let us walk becomingly; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and lasciviousness, not in strife"
Romans,13,14,"But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take forethought for the flesh to [fulfil its] lusts."
Romans,14,1,"Now him that is weak in the faith receive, not to [the] determining of questions of reasoning."
Romans,14,2,One
Romans,14,3,Let not him that eats make little
Romans,14,4,Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own master he stands or falls. And he shall be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand.
Romans,14,5,One man esteems day more than day; another esteems every day [alike]. Let each be fully persuaded
Romans,14,6,"He that regards the day, regards it to [the] Lord. And he that eats, eats to [the] Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that does not eat, [it is] to [the] Lord he does not eat, and gives"
Romans,14,7,"For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself."
Romans,14,8,"For both if we should live, [it is] to the Lord we live; and if we should die, [it is] to the Lord we die: both if we should live then, and"
Romans,14,9,"For to this [end] Christ has died and lived [again], that he might rule over both dead and living."
Romans,14,10,"But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or again, thou, why dost thou make little of thy brother? for we shall all be placed before the judgment-seat of God."
Romans,14,11,"For it is written, I live, saith [the] Lord, that to me shall bow every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God."
Romans,14,12,So then each of us shall give an account concerning himself to God. The Law of Love (Ezekiel 14:1–11; 1 Corinthians 8:1–13)
Romans,14,13,"Let us no longer therefore judge one another; but judge ye this rather, not to put a stumbling-block"
Romans,14,14,"I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean"
Romans,14,15,"For if on account of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer according to love. Destroy not him with"

Romans,14,22,Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Blessed
Romans,14,23,"But he that doubts, if he eat, is condemned; because [it is] not of faith; but whatever [is] not of faith is sin."
Romans,15,1,"But we ought, we that are strong, to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves."
Romans,15,2,"Let each one of us please his neighbour with a view to what is good, to edification."
Romans,15,3,"For the Christ also did not please himself; but according as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproach thee"
Romans,15,4,"For as many things as have been written before have been written for our instruction, that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope."
Romans,15,5,"Now the God of endurance and of encouragement give to you to be like-minded one toward another, according to Christ Jesus; 6that ye may with one accord, with one mouth, glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Christ the Servant of Jews and Gentiles"
Romans,15,7,"Wherefore receive ye one another, according as the Christ also has received you to [the] glory of God."
Romans,15,8,"For I say that Jesus Christ became a minister of [the] circumcision for [the] truth of God, to confirm the promises of the fathers; 9and that the nations should glorify God for mercy; according as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among [the] nations, and will sing to thy name."
Romans,15,10,"And again he says, Rejoice, nations, with his people."
Romans,15,11,"And again, Praise the Lord, all [ye] nations, and let all the peoples laud him."
Romans,15,12,"And again, Esaias says, There shall be the root of Jesse, and one that arises, to rule over [the] nations: in him shall [the] nations hope."
Romans,15,13,"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that ye should abound in hope by [the] power of [the] Holy Spirit. Paul the Minister to the Gentiles"
Romans,15,14,"But I am persuaded, my brethren, I myself also, concerning you, that yourselves also are full of"
Romans,15,15,"But I have written to you the more boldly, [brethren,] in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace given to me by God, 16for me to be minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, carrying on as a sacrificial service the [message of] glad tidings of God, in order that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by"
Romans,15,17,I have therefore [whereof to] boast in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to
Romans,15,18,"For I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not wrought by me, for [the] obedience of [the] nations, by word and deed, 19in [the] power of signs and wonders, in [the] power of [the] Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ; 20and so aiming to announce the glad tidings, not where Christ has been named, that I might not build upon another’s foundation; 21but according as it is written, To whom there was nothing told concerning him, they shall see; and they that have not heard shall understand."
Romans,15,22,Wherefore also I have been often hindered from coming to you. Paul’s Travel Plans (1 Corinthians 16:5–9)
Romans,15,23,"But now, having no longer place in these regions, and having great desire to come to you these many years, 24whenever I should go to Spain; (for I hope to see you as I go through, and by you to be set forward thither, if first I shall have been in part filled with your company;) 25but now I go to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints; 26for Macedonia and Achaia have been well pleased to make a"

Romans,15,30,"But I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in prayers for me to God; 31that I may be saved from those that do not believe in Judaea; and that my ministry which [I have] for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints; 32in order"
Romans,15,33,And the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
Romans,16,1,"But I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is minister of the assembly which is in Cenchrea; 2that ye may receive her in [the] Lord worthily of saints, and that ye may assist her in whatever matter she has need of you; for she also has been a helper of many, and of myself."

Romans,16,25,"Now to him that is able to establish you, according to my glad tidings and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to [the] revelation of [the] mystery, as to which silence has been kept in [the] times of the ages, 26but [which] has now been made manifest, and by prophetic scriptures, according to commandment of the eternal God, made known for obedience of faith to all the nations— 27[the] only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever. Amen."
1 Corinthians,1,1,"Paul, [a] called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God’s will, and Sosthenes the brother, 2to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to [those] sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours:"

1 Corinthians,1,16,"Yes, I"
1 Corinthians,1,17,"For Christ has not sent me to baptise, but to preach glad tidings; not in wisdom of word, that the cross of the Christ may not be made vain. The Message of the Cross"
1 Corinthians,1,18,"For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God’s power."
1 Corinthians,1,19,"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and set aside the understanding of the understanding ones."
1 Corinthians,1,20,Where [is the] wise? where scribe? where disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the
1 Corinthians,1,21,"For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom has not known God,"
1 Corinthians,1,22,"Since Jews indeed ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom; 23but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offence, and to nations foolishness; 24but to those that [are] called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ God’s power and God’s wisdom."

1 Corinthians,1,27,"But God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may put to shame the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world, that he may put to shame the strong things; 28and the ignoble things of the world, and the despised, has God chosen, [and] things"

1 Corinthians,2,3,"And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling; 4and my word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of [the] Spirit and of power; 5that your faith might not stand in men’s wisdom, but in God’s power. Spiritual Wisdom (Ephesians 1:15–23)"
1 Corinthians,2,6,"But we speak wisdom among the perfect; but wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world,"
1 Corinthians,2,7,"But we speak God’s wisdom in [a] mystery, that hidden [wisdom] which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory: 8which none of the princes of this age knew, (for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;) 9but according as it is written, Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man’s heart, which God has prepared for them that love him, 10but God has revealed to us by [his] Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God."
1 Corinthians,2,11,For who of men hath known the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? thus
1 Corinthians,2,12,"But we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which [is] of God, that we may know the things which have been freely given to us of God: 13which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual [things] by spiritual [means]."
1 Corinthians,2,14,"But [the] natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him; and he cannot know [them] because they are spiritually discerned; 15but the spiritual discerns all things,"
1 Corinthians,2,16,"For who has known the mind of [the] Lord, who shall instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,1,"And I, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in"
1 Corinthians,3,2,"I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able; 3for ye are yet carnal. For whereas [there are] among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal,"

1 Corinthians,3,5,"Who then is Apollos, and who Paul? Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the"

1 Corinthians,3,16,"Do ye not know that ye are [the] temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?"
1 Corinthians,3,17,"If any one corrupt the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye."
1 Corinthians,3,18,"Let no one deceive himself: if any one thinks himself to be wise among you in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise."

1 Corinthians,4,2,"Here,"

1 Corinthians,4,14,"Not [as] chiding do I write these things to you, but as my beloved children I admonish [you]."

1 Corinthians,5,6,Your boasting [is] not good. Do ye not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
1 Corinthians,5,7,"Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened. For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed; 8so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened [bread] of sincerity and truth.

1 Corinthians,7,20,Let each abide in that calling in which he has been called.
1 Corinthians,7,21,"Hast thou been called [being] a bondman, let it not concern thee; but and if thou canst become free,"
1 Corinthians,7,22,For the bondman that is called in [the] Lord is the Lord’s freedman; in like manner

1 Corinthians,7,29,"But this I say, brethren, the time is straitened. For the rest, that they who have wives, be as not having [any]: 30and they that weep, as not weeping; and they that rejoice, as not rejoicing; and they that buy, as not possessing; 31and they that use the world, as not disposing of it as their own; for the fashion of this world passes."
1 Corinthians,7,32,"But I wish you to be without care. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord; 33but he that has married cares for the things of the world, how he shall please his"
1 Corinthians,7,34,"There is a difference between the wife and the virgin. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she that has married cares for the things"
1 Corinthians,7,35,"But I say this for your own profit; not that I may set a snare before you, but for what [is] seemly, and waiting on the Lord without distraction."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"But if any one think that he behaves unseemly to his virginity, if he be beyond the flower of his age,"
1 Corinthians,7,37,"But he who stands firm in his heart, having no need, but has authority over his own will, and has judged this in his heart to"
1 Corinthians,7,38,So that he that marries himself does well; and he that does not marry does better.
1 Corinthians,7,39,"A wife is bound for whatever time her husband lives; but if the husband be fallen asleep, she is free"
1 Corinthians,7,40,"But she is happier if she so remain, according to my judgment; but I think that I also have God’s Spirit."
1 Corinthians,8,1,"But concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge: knowledge puffs up,"
1 Corinthians,8,2,"If any one think he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know [it]."
1 Corinthians,8,3,"But if any one love God, he is known of him): 4—concerning then the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol [is] nothing in [the]"
1 Corinthians,8,5,"For and if indeed there are [those] called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are gods many, and lords many,) 6yet to us [there is] one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom [are] all things, and we by him."
1 Corinthians,8,7,"But knowledge [is] not in all: but some, with conscience of the idol, until now eat as of a thing"
1 Corinthians,8,8,But meat does not commend us to
1 Corinthians,8,9,But
1 Corinthians,8,10,"For if any one see thee, who hast knowledge, sitting at table in an idol-house, shall not his conscience, he being weak, be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to the idol? 11and the weak [one], the brother for whose"

1 Corinthians,9,2,"If I am not an apostle to others, yet at any rate I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in [the] Lord."
1 Corinthians,9,3,My defence to those who examine me is this:
1 Corinthians,9,4,"Have we not a right to eat and to drink? 5have we not a right to take round a sister [as] wife, as also the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and"
1 Corinthians,9,6,"Or I alone and Barnabas, have we not a right not to work?"
1 Corinthians,9,7,Who ever carries on war at his own charges? who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? or who herds a flock and does not eat of the milk of the flock?
1 Corinthians,9,8,"Do I speak these things as a man, or does not the law also say these things?"
1 Corinthians,9,9,"For in the law of Moses it is written, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that is treading out corn. Is God occupied about the oxen, 10or does he say [it] altogether for our sakes? For for our sakes it has been written, that the plougher"

1 Corinthians,9,13,Do ye not know that they who labour [at] sacred things eat of the [offerings offered in the] temple; they that attend at the altar
1 Corinthians,9,14,So also the Lord has ordained to those that announce the glad tidings to live of the glad tidings.
1 Corinthians,9,15,But I have used none of these things. Now I have not written these things that it should be thus in
1 Corinthians,9,16,"For if I announce the glad tidings, I have nothing to boast of; for a necessity is laid upon me; for it is woe"
1 Corinthians,9,17,"For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if"
1 Corinthians,9,18,"What is the reward then that I have? That in announcing the glad tidings I make the glad tidings costless [to others], so as not to have made use, as belonging to me, of my right in [announcing] the glad tidings. Paul the Servant to All"

1 Corinthians,9,24,"Know ye not that they who run in [the] race-course run all, but one receives the prize? Thus run in"
1 Corinthians,9,25,But every one that contends [for a prize] is temperate in all things: they
1 Corinthians,9,26,"I therefore thus run,"
1 Corinthians,9,27,"But I buffet my body, and lead it captive, lest [after] having preached to others I should be myself rejected."
1 Corinthians,10,1,"For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; 2and all were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 3and all ate the same spiritual food, 4and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed [them]: (now the rock was the Christ;) 5yet God was not pleased with the most of them, for they were strewed in the desert."
1 Corinthians,10,6,"But these things happened [as] types of us, that we should not be lusters after evil things, as they"
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and"
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed"
1 Corinthians,10,9,"Neither let us tempt the Christ, as some"
1 Corinthians,10,10,"Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and"
1 Corinthians,10,11,"Now all these things happened to them [as] types, and have been written"
1 Corinthians,10,12,So that let him that thinks that he

Flee from Idolatry (Exodus 20:22–26)"
1 Corinthians,10,14,"Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry."

1 Corinthians,10,22,Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? All to God’s Glory (1 Peter 4:1–11)
1 Corinthians,10,23,"All things are lawful, but all are not profitable; all things are lawful, but all do not edify."
1 Corinthians,10,24,Let no one

1 Corinthians,10,31,"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatever ye do, do all things to God’s glory."
1 Corinthians,10,32,Give no occasion

1 Corinthians,11,7,"For man indeed ought not to have his head covered, being God’s image"

1 Corinthians,11,30,"On this account many among you [are] weak and infirm, and a good many"
1 Corinthians,11,31,"But if we judged ourselves, so were we not judged."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But being judged, we are disciplined of [the] Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"So that, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"If any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye may not come together for judgment. But the other things, whenever I come, I will set in order."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"But concerning spiritual [manifestations], brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant."
1 Corinthians,12,2,Ye know that
1 Corinthians,12,3,"I give you therefore to know, that no one, speaking in [the power of the] Spirit of God, says, Curse [on] Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in [the power of the] Holy Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; 5and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord; 6and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates all things in all."
1 Corinthians,12,7,But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit.
1 Corinthians,12,8,"For to one, by the Spirit, is given [the] word of wisdom; and to another [the] word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; 9and to a different one faith, in [the power of] the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healing in [the power of] the same Spirit; 10and to another operations of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to a different one kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,11,"But all these things operates the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each in particular according as he pleases. The Body of Christ"
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many,"
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For also in [the power of] one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,14,For also the body is not one member but many.

But God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to [the part] that lacked; 25that there might be no division in the body, but that the members might have the same concern one for"

1 Corinthians,13,3,"And if I shall dole out all my goods in food, and if I deliver up my body that I may be burned, but have not love, I profit nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Love has long patience, is kind; love is not emulous [of others]; love is not insolent and rash, is not puffed up, 5does not behave in an unseemly manner, does not seek what is its own, is not quickly provoked, does not impute evil, 6does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth, 7bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Love never fails; but whether prophecies, they shall be done away; or tongues, they shall cease; or"

1 Corinthians,13,12,"For we see now through a dim window obscurely, but then face to face; now I know"
1 Corinthians,13,13,"And now abide faith, hope, love; these three things; and the greater of these [is] love."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Follow after love, and be emulous of spiritual [manifestations], but rather that ye may prophesy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,For he that speaks with a tongue does not speak to men but to God: for no one hears; but in spirit he

1 Corinthians,14,4,He that speaks with a tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies [the]
1 Corinthians,14,5,"Now I desire that ye should all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy. But greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, unless he interpret, that the assembly may receive edification."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"And now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I shall"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"Even lifeless things giving a sound, whether pipe or harp, if they give not distinction to the sounds, how shall it be known"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"For also, if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"Thus also ye with the tongue, unless ye give a distinct speech, how shall it be known what"
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the"
1 Corinthians,14,11,"If therefore I do not know the power of the sound, I"
1 Corinthians,14,12,"Thus ye also, since ye are desirous of spirits, seek that ye may abound for the edification of the assembly."
1 Corinthians,14,13,Wherefore let him that speaks with a tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray with a tongue,"
1 Corinthians,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the"
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Since otherwise, if thou blessest with [the] spirit, how shall he who fills the place of the simple [Christian] say Amen, at thy giving of thanks, since he does not know what thou sayest?"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"For thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified."
1 Corinthians,14,18,"I thank God I speak in a tongue more than all of you: 19but in [the] assembly I desire to speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also, [rather] than ten thousand words in a tongue."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brethren, be not children in [your] minds, but in malice be babes; but in [your] minds be grown"

1 Corinthians,14,26,"What is it then, brethren? whenever ye come together, each [of you] has a psalm, has a teaching,"
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If any one speak with a tongue, [let it be] two, or at the most three, and separately, and let one interpret; 28but if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in [the] assembly, and let him speak to himself and to God."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"And let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge."
1 Corinthians,14,30,But if there be a revelation to
1 Corinthians,14,31,"For ye can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn"
1 Corinthians,14,32,And spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.
1 Corinthians,14,33,"For God is not [a God] of disorder but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints."
1 Corinthians,14,34,"Let [your] women be silent in the assemblies, for it is not permitted to them to speak; but to be in"
1 Corinthians,14,35,"But if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands"
1 Corinthians,14,36,"Did the word of God go out from you, or did it come to you only?"
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you,"
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"So that, brethren, desire to prophesy, and do not forbid the speaking with tongues."
1 Corinthians,14,40,But let all things be done comelily and with order.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"But I make known to you, brethren, the glad tidings which I announced to you, which also ye received, in which also ye stand, 2by which also ye are saved, (if ye hold fast the word which I announced to you as the glad tidings,) unless indeed ye have believed in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For I delivered to you, in the first place, what also I had received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures; 4and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according"
1 Corinthians,15,6,"Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also have fallen asleep."
1 Corinthians,15,7,"Then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles; 8and last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared"
1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called apostle, because I have"

1 Corinthians,15,11,"Whether, therefore, I or they, thus we preach, and thus ye have believed. The Resurrection of the Dead"
1 Corinthians,15,12,"Now if Christ is preached that he is raised from among [the] dead, how say some among you that"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"But if there is not a resurrection of [those that are] dead, neither is Christ raised: 14but if Christ is not raised, then, indeed, vain also [is] our preaching,"
1 Corinthians,15,15,"And we are found also false witnesses of God; for we have witnessed concerning God that he raised the Christ, whom he has not raised if indeed [those that are] dead are"
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if [those that are] dead are not raised, neither is Christ raised; 17but if Christ be not"
1 Corinthians,15,18,Then indeed also those who have fallen asleep in

1 Corinthians,15,29,Since what shall the baptised for the dead do if [those that are] dead rise not at all? why also are

1 Corinthians,15,40,"And [there are] heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies: but different is the glory of the heavenly, different that of the earthly: 41one [the] sun’s glory, and another [the] moon’s glory, and another [the] stars’ glory; for star differs from star in glory."
1 Corinthians,15,42,"Thus also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility."
1 Corinthians,15,43,It
1 Corinthians,15,44,"It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body: if there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [one]."
1 Corinthians,15,45,"Thus also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a quickening spirit."

1 Corinthians,15,55,"Where, O death, [is] thy sting? where, O death,"
1 Corinthians,15,56,"Now the sting of death [is] sin, and the power of sin the law; 57but thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,15,58,"So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in [the] Lord."
1 Corinthians,16,1,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the assemblies of Galatia, so do ye do also."

1 Corinthians,16,11,"Let not therefore any one despise him; but set him forward in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren."
1 Corinthians,16,12,"Now concerning the brother Apollos, I begged him much that he would go to you with the brethren; but it was not at all [his] will to go now; but he will come when he shall have good opportunity. Concluding Exhortations"
1 Corinthians,16,13,Be vigilant; stand fast in the faith; quit yourselves like men; be strong.
1 Corinthians,16,14,Let all things ye do be done in love.
1 Corinthians,16,15,"But I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the saints for service,) 16that ye should also be subject to such,"
1 Corinthians,16,17,But I rejoice in the coming of Stephanas and

2 Corinthians,1,3,"Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions, and God of all encouragement; 4who encourages us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to encourage those who are in any tribulation whatever, through the encouragement with which we ourselves are"
2 Corinthians,1,5,"Because, even as the sufferings of the Christ abound towards us, so through the"
2 Corinthians,1,6,"But whether we are in tribulation, [it is] for your encouragement and salvation, wrought in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer, 7(and our hope for you [is] sure;) or whether we are encouraged, [it is] for your encouragement and salvation: knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the encouragement."
2 Corinthians,1,8,"For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, as to our tribulation which happened [to us] in Asia,"
2 Corinthians,1,9,"But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; 10who has delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom we confide that he will also yet deliver; 11ye also labouring together by supplication for us that the gift towards us, through means of many persons, may be the subject of the thanksgiving of many for us. Paul’s Change of Plans"
2 Corinthians,1,12,"For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity before God, (not in fleshly wisdom but in God’s grace,) we have had our conversation in the world, and more"
2 Corinthians,1,13,"For we do not write other things to you but what ye well know and recognise; and I hope that ye will recognise to the end, 14even as also ye have recognised us in part, that we are your boast, even as ye [are] ours in the day of the Lord Jesus."
2 Corinthians,1,15,"And with this confidence I purposed to come to you previously, that ye might have a second favour; 16and to pass through to Macedonia by you, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be set"

2 Corinthians,2,6,"Sufficient to such a one [is] this rebuke which [has been inflicted] by the many; 7so that on the contrary ye should rather shew grace and encourage, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed"

2 Corinthians,2,13,"I had no rest in my spirit at not finding Titus my brother; but bidding them adieu, I came away to Macedonia."
2 Corinthians,2,14,"But thanks [be] to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour"
2 Corinthians,2,15,"For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish: 16to the one an odour from death unto death, but to the others an odour"
2 Corinthians,2,17,"For we do not, as the many, make a trade of the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, before God, we speak in Christ."
2 Corinthians,3,1,"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or do we need, as some, commendatory letters to you, or"
2 Corinthians,3,2,"Ye are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men, 3being manifested to be Christ’s epistle ministered by us, written, not with ink, but [the] Spirit of [the] living God; not on stone tables, but on fleshy tables of [the] heart."
2 Corinthians,3,4,"And such confidence have we through the Christ towards God: 5not that we are competent of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our competency [is] of God; 6who has also made us competent, [as] ministers of [the] new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens. The Glory of the New Covenant (Exodus 34:10–35) 7(But if the ministry of death, in letters, graven in stones, began with glory, so that the children of Israel could not fix their eyes on the face of Moses, on account of the glory of his face, [a glory] which"
2 Corinthians,3,9,For if the ministry of

2 Corinthians,3,12,"Having therefore such hope, we use much boldness: 13and not according as Moses put a veil on his"
2 Corinthians,3,14,"But their thoughts have been darkened, for unto this day the same veil remains in reading the old covenant,"
2 Corinthians,3,15,"But unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil lies upon"
2 Corinthians,3,16,"But when it shall turn to [the] Lord, the veil is taken away.)"
2 Corinthians,3,17,"Now the Lord is the Spirit,"
2 Corinthians,3,18,"But we all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by [the] Lord [the] Spirit."
2 Corinthians,4,1,"Therefore, having this ministry, as we have had mercy shewn us, we faint not."
2 Corinthians,4,2,"But we have rejected the hidden things of shame, not walking in deceit, nor falsifying the word of God, but by manifestation"
2 Corinthians,4,3,"But if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost; 4in whom the god of this world has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is [the] image"

2 Corinthians,4,6,Because [it is] the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in [the] face of [Jesus] Christ. Treasure in Jars of Clay (Romans 6:1–14)
2 Corinthians,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us: 8every way afflicted, but not straitened; seeing no apparent issue, but our way not entirely shut up; 9persecuted, but not abandoned; cast down, but not destroyed; 10always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body; 11for we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh; 12so that death works in us, but life in you."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"And having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, I have believed, therefore have I spoken; we also believe, therefore also we speak; 14knowing that he who has raised the Lord Jesus"
2 Corinthians,4,15,"For all things [are] for your sakes, that the grace abounding through the many may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God."
2 Corinthians,4,16,"Wherefore we faint not; but if indeed our outward man is consumed, yet the inward is renewed day"
2 Corinthians,4,17,"For our momentary [and] light affliction works for us in surpassing measure an eternal weight of glory; 18while we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen [are] for a time, but those that are not seen eternal."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"For we know that if our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house"
2 Corinthians,5,2,"For indeed in this we groan, ardently desiring to have put on our house which [is] from heaven; 3if indeed being also clothed we shall not be found naked."
2 Corinthians,5,4,"For indeed we who are in the tabernacle groan, being burdened; while yet we do not wish to be"
2 Corinthians,5,5,"Now he that has wrought us for this very thing [is] God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit."
2 Corinthians,5,6,"Therefore [we are] always confident, and know that while present in the body we are absent from the Lord, 7(for we walk by faith, not by sight;) 8we are confident, I say, and pleased rather to be"
2 Corinthians,5,9,"Wherefore also we are zealous, whether present or"
2 Corinthians,5,10,"For we must all be manifested before the judgment-seat of the Christ, that each may receive the things [done] in the body, according to those he has done, whether [it be] good or evil. Ambassadors for Christ"
2 Corinthians,5,11,"Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men, but have been manifested to God, and I hope also that we have been manifested in your consciences. 12[For] we do not again commend ourselves to you, but [we are] giving to you occasion of boast in our behalf, that ye may have [such]"
2 Corinthians,5,13,"For whether we are beside ourselves, [it is] to"
2 Corinthians,5,14,"For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; 15and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised."
2 Corinthians,5,16,So that we henceforth know no one according to flesh; but if even we have known Christ according
2 Corinthians,5,17,"So if any one [be] in Christ, [there is] a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new: 18and all things [are] of the God who has reconciled us to himself by [Jesus] Christ, and given to us the ministry of that reconciliation: 19how that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences; and putting in us the word of that reconciliation."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"We are ambassadors therefore for Christ, God as [it were] beseeching by us, we entreat for Christ,"
2 Corinthians,5,21,"Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that we might become God’s righteousness in him."
2 Corinthians,6,1,"But [as] fellow-workmen, we also beseech that ye receive not the grace of God in vain: 2(for he says, I have listened to thee in an accepted time, and I have helped thee in a day of salvation: behold, now [is the] well-accepted time; behold, now [the] day of salvation:) 3giving no manner of offence in anything, that the ministry be not blamed; 4but in everything commending ourselves as God’s ministers, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits, 5in stripes, in prisons, in riots, in labours, in watchings, in fastings, 6in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in [the] Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned, 7in [the] word of truth, in [the] power of God; through the arms of righteousness on the right hand and left, 8through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report: as deceivers, and true; 9as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as disciplined, and not put to death; 10as grieved, but always rejoicing; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things."
2 Corinthians,6,11,"Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart is expanded."
2 Corinthians,6,12,"Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your affections; 13but for an answering recompense, (I speak as to children,) let your heart also expand itself. Do Not Be Unequally Yoked"
2 Corinthians,6,14,"Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers; for what participation [is there] between righteousness and lawlessness? or what fellowship of light with darkness? 15and what consent of Christ with Beliar, or what part for a believer along with an unbeliever? 16and what agreement of God’s temple with idols? for ye are [the] living God’s temple; according as God has said, I will dwell among them, and walk among [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people."
2 Corinthians,6,17,"Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith [the] Lord, and touch not [what is] unclean, and I will receive you; 18and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith [the] Lord Almighty."
2 Corinthians,7,1,"Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God’s fear."
2 Corinthians,7,2,"Receive us: we have injured no one, we have ruined no one, we have made gain of no one."
2 Corinthians,7,3,"I do not speak for condemnation, for I have already said that ye are in our hearts, to die together, and live"
2 Corinthians,7,4,"Great [is] my boldness towards you, great my exulting in respect of you; I am filled with encouragement; I overabound in joy under all our affliction."
2 Corinthians,7,5,"For indeed, when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but [we were] afflicted in every"
2 Corinthians,7,6,"But he who encourages those that are [brought] low, [even] God, encouraged us by the coming of Titus; 7and not by his coming only, but also through the encouragement with which he was encouraged as to you; relating to us your ardent desire, your"
2 Corinthians,7,8,"For if also I grieved you in the letter, I do not regret [it], if even I have regretted it; for I see that that letter, if even [it were] only for a time,"
2 Corinthians,7,9,"Now I rejoice, not that ye have been grieved, but that ye have been grieved to repentance; for ye have been grieved according to God, that in nothing ye might be injured by us."
2 Corinthians,7,10,"For grief according to God works repentance to salvation, never to be regretted; but the grief of the"
2 Corinthians,7,11,"For, behold, this same thing, your being grieved according to God, how much diligence it wrought in you, but [what] excusing [of yourselves], but [what] indignation, but [what] fear, but [what] ardent desire, but [what] zeal, but [what] vengeance: in every way ye have proved"
2 Corinthians,7,12,"So then, if also I wrote to you, [it was] not for the sake of him that injured, nor for the sake of him that was injured, but for the sake of our diligent zeal for you being"
2 Corinthians,7,13,"For this reason we have been encouraged. And we the rather rejoiced in our encouragement more abundantly by reason of the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been"
2 Corinthians,7,14,"Because if I boasted to him anything about you, I have not been put to shame; but as we have spoken to you all things in truth, so also our boasting to Titus has been [the] truth; 15and his affections are more abundantly towards you, calling to mind the obedience of you all, how"
2 Corinthians,7,16,I rejoice that in everything I am confident as to you.
2 Corinthians,8,1,"But we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God bestowed in the assemblies of Macedonia; 2that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty has abounded to"
2 Corinthians,8,3,"For according to [their] power, I bear witness, and beyond [their] power, [they were] willing of their own accord, 4begging of us with much entreaty [to give"
2 Corinthians,8,5,And not
2 Corinthians,8,6,"So that we begged Titus that, according as he had before begun, so he would also complete as to you this grace also; 7but even as ye abound in every way, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in love"
2 Corinthians,8,8,"I do not speak as commanding [it], but through the zeal of others, and proving the genuineness of your love."

2 Corinthians,8,16,"But thanks [be] to God, who gives the same diligent zeal for you in the heart of Titus."
2 Corinthians,8,17,"For he received indeed the entreaty, but, being full of zeal, he went of his own accord to you; 18but we have sent with him the brother whose praise [is] in the glad tidings through all the assemblies; 19and not only [so], but [is] also chosen by the assemblies as our fellow-traveller with this grace, ministered by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and [a witness of] our readiness; 20avoiding this, that any one should blame us in this abundance [which is] administered by us; 21for we provide for things honest,"
2 Corinthians,8,22,"And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved to be of diligent zeal in many things, and now more diligently zealous through the"
2 Corinthians,8,23,"Whether as regards Titus, [he is] my companion and fellow- labourer in your behalf; or our brethren, [they are] deputed messengers of assemblies, Christ’s glory."
2 Corinthians,8,24,"Shew therefore to them, before the assemblies, the proof of your love, and of our boasting about you."
2 Corinthians,9,1,"For concerning the ministration which [is] for the saints, it is superfluous my writing to you."
2 Corinthians,9,2,"For I know your readiness, which I boast of as respects you to Macedonians, that Achaia is prepared since"
2 Corinthians,9,3,"But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made void in this respect, in order that, as I have said, ye may be prepared; 4lest haply, if Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared,"
2 Corinthians,9,5,"I thought it necessary therefore to beg the brethren that they would come to you, and complete beforehand your fore-announced blessing, that this may be ready thus as blessing, and not as got out of you."
2 Corinthians,9,6,"But this [is true], he that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that sows in [the spirit of] blessing shall reap also in blessing: 7each according as he is purposed in his heart; not grievingly, or"
2 Corinthians,9,8,"But God is able to make every gracious gift abound towards you, that, having in every way always all-sufficiency, ye may abound to every good work: 9according as it is written, He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor, his righteousness remains for ever."
2 Corinthians,9,10,"Now he that supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating shall supply and make abundant your sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness: 11enriched in every way unto all free-hearted"
2 Corinthians,9,12,"Because the ministration of this service is not only filling up the measure of what is lacking to the saints, but also abounding by many thanksgivings to God; 13they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration, by reason of your subjection, by profession, to the glad tidings of the Christ, and your free-hearted liberality in communicating towards them and towards all; 14and in their supplication for you, full of ardent desire for you, on account of"

2 Corinthians,10,1,"But I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ, who, as to appearance, [when present] [am] mean among you, but absent am bold towards you; 2but I beseech that present I may not be bold with the confidence with which I think to be daring towards some who think of us"
2 Corinthians,10,3,"For walking in flesh, we do not war according to flesh."
2 Corinthians,10,4,"For the arms of our warfare [are] not fleshly, but powerful according to God to [the] overthrow of strongholds; 5overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God, and leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ; 6and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled."
2 Corinthians,10,7,"Do ye look at what concerns appearance? If any one has confidence in himself that he is of Christ, let"
2 Corinthians,10,8,"For and if I should boast even somewhat more abundantly of our authority, which the Lord has given [to us] for building up and not for your overthrowing, I shall not be put to shame; 9that I may not seem as if I was frightening you by letters: 10because his letters, he says, [are] weighty and strong, but his presence"
2 Corinthians,10,11,"Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by letters [when] absent, such also present in deed."

Galatians,3,20,"But a mediator is not of one, but God is one. 21[Is] then the law against the promises of God? Far be the thought.

Galatians,3,23,"But before faith came, we were guarded under law, shut up to faith [which was] about to be revealed."

Galatians,4,25,"For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which [is] now, for she is in bondage with her children; 26but the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother."
Galatians,4,27,"For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break out and cry, thou that travailest not; because the children of the desolate are more numerous than [those] of her that has a husband."
Galatians,4,28,"But ye, brethren, after the pattern of Isaac, are children of promise."
Galatians,4,29,"But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him [that was born] according to Spirit, so also [it is] now."
Galatians,4,30,But what says the scripture? Cast out the maid servant and her son; for the son of the maid servant shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.

Ephesians,3,14,"For this reason I bow my knees to the Father [of our Lord Jesus Christ], 15of whom every family in [the] heavens and on earth is named, 16in order that he may give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; 17that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love, 18in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what [is] the breadth and length and depth and height; 19and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled [even] to all the fulness of God."
Ephesians,3,20,"But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think, according to the power which works in us, 21to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages. Amen)."
Ephesians,4,1,"I, the prisoner in [the] Lord, exhort you therefore to walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye have been called, 2with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing with one another in love; 3using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. 4[There is] one body and one Spirit, as ye have been also called in one hope of your calling; 5one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all."
Ephesians,4,7,But to each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ.
Ephesians,4,8,"Wherefore he says, Having ascended up on high, he has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men."
Ephesians,4,9,"But that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?"
Ephesians,4,10,"He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things; 11and he has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, 12for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to [the] work of [the] ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ; 13until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at [the] full-grown man, at [the] measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ; 14in order that we may be no longer babes, tossed and carried about by every wind of that teaching [which is] in the sleight of men, in unprincipled cunning with a view to systematized error; 15but, holding the truth in love, we may grow up to him in all things, who is the head, the Christ: 16from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to [the] working in [its] measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love. New Life in Christ (Colossians 3:1–17)"
Ephesians,4,17,"This I say therefore, and testify in [the] Lord, that ye should no longer walk as [the rest of] the nations walk in [the] vanity of their mind, 18being darkened in understanding, estranged from the life of God by reason of the ignorance which is in them, by reason of the hardness of their hearts, 19who having cast off all feeling, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with"
Ephesians,4,20,"But ye have not thus learnt the Christ, 21if ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as [the] truth is in Jesus; 22[namely] your having put off according to the former conversation the old man which corrupts itself according to the deceitful lusts; 23and being renewed in the spirit of your mind; 24and [your] having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness."
Ephesians,4,25,"Wherefore, having put off falsehood, speak truth every one with his neighbour, because we are"
Ephesians,4,26,"Be angry, and do not sin; let not the sun set upon your wrath, 27neither"
Ephesians,4,28,"Let the stealer steal no more, but rather let him toil, working what is honest"

Ephesians,4,30,"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with which ye have been sealed for [the] day of"
Ephesians,4,31,"Let all bitterness, and heat of passion, and wrath, and clamour, and injurious language, be removed from you, with all malice; 32and be to one another kind, compassionate, forgiving one another, so as God also in Christ has forgiven you."
Ephesians,5,1,"Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children, 2and walk in love, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour."
Ephesians,5,3,"But fornication and all uncleanness or unbridled lust, let it not be even named among you, as it becomes saints; 4and filthiness and foolish talking, or jesting, which are not convenient; but rather"
Ephesians,5,5,"For this ye are [well] informed of, knowing that no fornicator, or unclean person, or person of unbridled lust, who is an idolater, has inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and God."
Ephesians,5,6,"Let no one deceive you with vain words, for on account of these things the wrath of God comes upon"
Ephesians,5,7,"Be not ye therefore fellow-partakers with them; Children of Light 8for ye were once darkness, but now light in [the] Lord; walk as children of light, 9(for the fruit of the light [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth,) 10proving what is agreeable to the Lord; 11and do not have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather also reprove [them], 12for the"
Ephesians,5,13,But all things having their true character exposed by the light are made manifest; for that which makes everything manifest is light.
Ephesians,5,14,"Wherefore he says, Wake up, [thou] that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee."
Ephesians,5,15,"See therefore how ye walk carefully, not as unwise but as wise, 16redeeming the time, because the"
Ephesians,5,17,"For this reason be not foolish, but understanding what [is] the will of the Lord."
Ephesians,5,18,"And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, 19speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord; 20giving thanks at all times for all things to him [who is] God and [the] Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Wives and Husbands (Song of Solomon 1:1–17; 1 Peter 3:1–7) 21submitting yourselves to one another in [the] fear of Christ."
Ephesians,5,22,"Wives, [submit yourselves] to your own husbands, as to the Lord, 23for a husband is head of the"
Ephesians,5,24,"But even as the assembly is subjected to the Christ, so also wives to their own husbands in everything."
Ephesians,5,25,"Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it, 26in order that he might sanctify it, purifying [it] by the washing of water by [the] word, 27that he might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such"
Ephesians,5,28,So ought men also to love their own wives as their
Ephesians,5,29,"For no one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as also the Christ the assembly: 30for we are members of his body;"
Ephesians,5,31,"Because of this a man shall leave his father and mother, and"
Ephesians,5,32,"This mystery is great, but I speak as to"
Ephesians,5,33,"But ye also, every one of you, let each so love his own wife as himself; but as to the wife [I speak] that she may fear the husband."
Ephesians,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in [the] Lord, for this is just."
Ephesians,6,2,"Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with a promise, 3that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest be long-lived on the earth."
Ephesians,6,4,"And [ye] fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in [the] discipline and admonition of [the] Lord. Serving with Honor (Colossians 3:22–25; 1 Timothy 6:1–2)"
Ephesians,6,5,"Bondmen, obey masters according to flesh, with fear and trembling, in simplicity of your heart as to the Christ; 6not with eye-service as men-pleasers; but as bondmen of Christ, doing the will of God from [the] soul, 7serving with good will as to the Lord, and not to men; 8knowing that whatever good each shall do, this he shall receive of [the] Lord, whether bond or free."
Ephesians,6,9,"And, masters, do the same things towards them, giving up threatening, knowing that both their and your Master is in heaven, and there is no acceptance of persons with him. The Full Armor of God"
Ephesians,6,10,"For the rest, brethren, be strong in [the] Lord, and in the might of his strength."
Ephesians,6,11,"Put on the panoply of God, that ye may be able to stand against the artifices of the devil: 12because our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this"
Ephesians,6,13,"For this reason take [to you] the panoply of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having accomplished all things,"
Ephesians,6,14,"Stand therefore, having girt about your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 15and shod your feet with [the] preparation of the glad tidings of peace: 16besides all [these], having taken the shield of faith with which ye will be able to quench all the inflamed darts"
Ephesians,6,17,"Have also the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is God’s word; 18praying at all seasons, with all prayer and supplication in [the] Spirit, and watching unto this very thing with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints; 19and for me in order that utterance may be given to me in [the] opening of my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the glad tidings, 20for which I am an ambassador [bound] with a chain, that I may be bold in it as I ought to speak. Final Greetings (Philippians 4:21–23; 2 Timothy 4:19–22)"
Ephesians,6,21,"But in order that ye also may know what concerns me, how I am getting on, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in [the] Lord, shall make all things known to you; 22whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that ye may know of our affairs and that he may encourage your hearts."
Ephesians,6,23,"Peace to the brethren, and love with faith, from God [the] Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ."
Ephesians,6,24,Grace with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.
Philippians,1,1,"Paul and Timotheus, bondmen of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with [the] overseers and ministers; 2grace to you, and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ. Thanksgiving and Prayer (1 Corinthians 1:4–9; Colossians 1:3–14)"
Philippians,1,3,"I thank my God for my whole remembrance of you, 4constantly in my every supplication, making the supplication for you all with joy, 5because of your fellowship with the gospel, from the first day until now; 6having confidence of this very thing, that he who has begun in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ’s day: 7as it is righteous for me to think this as to you all, because ye have me in your hearts, and that both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings ye are"
Philippians,1,8,For God is my witness how I long after you all in [the] bowels of Christ
Philippians,1,9,"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence, 10that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ’s day, 11being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which [is] by Jesus Christ, to God’s glory and praise. Paul’s Trials Advance the Gospel (James 1:2–12)"
Philippians,1,12,"But I would have you know, brethren, that the circumstances in which I am have turned out rather to the furtherance of the glad tidings, 13so that my bonds have become manifest [as being] in Christ in all the praetorium and to all others; 14and that the most of the brethren, trusting in [the] Lord"
Philippians,1,15,Some indeed also for
Philippians,1,16,"These indeed out of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the glad tidings; 17but those out of contention, announce the Christ,"
Philippians,1,18,"What is it then? at any rate, in every way, whether in pretext or in truth, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice, yea, also I will rejoice; 19for I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation, through your supplication and [the] supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ; 20according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but in all boldness, as always, now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death. To Live Is Christ"
Philippians,1,21,"For for me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain; 22but if to live in flesh [is my lot], this is for me worth"
Philippians,1,23,"But I am pressed by both, having the desire for departure and being with Christ, [for] [it is] very much better, 24but remaining in the flesh [is] more necessary for your sakes; 25and having confidence of this, I know that I shall remain and abide along with you all, for your progress and joy in faith; 26that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus through me by my presence again with you. Worthy of the Gospel"
Philippians,1,27,"Only conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ, in order that whether coming and seeing you, or absent, I may hear of what concerns you, that ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul, labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings; 28and not frightened in anything by the opposers, which is to them a demonstration of destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God; 29because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also, 30having the same conflict which ye have seen in me, and now hear of in me."
Philippians,2,1,"If then [there be] any comfort in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of [the] Spirit, if any bowels and compassions, 2fulfil my joy, that ye may think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking one thing; 3[let] nothing [be] in the spirit of strife or vain glory, but, in lowliness of mind, each esteeming the other as more excellent than themselves; 4regarding not each his own [qualities], but each those of others also. The Mind of Christ (Isaiah 52:13–15)"
Philippians,2,5,"For let this mind be in you which [was] also in Christ Jesus; 6who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; 7but emptied himself, taking a bondman’s form, taking his place in [the] likeness of men; 8and having been found in figure as a man,"
Philippians,2,9,"Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name, 10that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal [beings], 11and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord to God [the] Father’s glory. Lights in the World (Matthew 5:13–16)"
Philippians,2,12,"So that, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, 13for it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to [his] good pleasure."
Philippians,2,14,"Do all things without murmurings and reasonings, 15that ye may be harmless and simple, irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation; among whom ye appear as lights in [the] world, 16holding forth [the] word of life, so as to be a boast for me in Christ’s"
Philippians,2,17,But if also I am poured out as a libation on the

Philippians,2,20,For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye

Philippians,2,22,"But ye know the proof of him,"
Philippians,2,23,"Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I shall see how it goes with me: 24but I trust in [the] Lord that I myself also shall soon come; 25but I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-workman and fellow-soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need, 26since he had a longing desire after you all, and was distressed because ye had heard that he was sick; 27for he was also sick close to death, but God had mercy on him, and not indeed on him alone, but also on me, that I might not have sorrow"
Philippians,2,28,"I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that seeing him ye might again rejoice,"
Philippians,2,29,"Receive him therefore in [the] Lord with all joy, and hold such in honour; 30because for the sake of the work he drew near even to death, venturing his life that he might fill up what lacked in your ministration toward me."
Philippians,3,1,"For the rest, my brethren, rejoice in [the] Lord: to write the same things to you, to me [is] not irksome, and for you safe."
Philippians,3,2,"See to dogs, see to evil workmen, see to the concision."
Philippians,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, who worship by"
Philippians,3,4,"Though I have [my] trust even in flesh; if any other think to trust in flesh, I rather: 5as to circumcision, [I received it] the eighth day; of [the] race of Israel, of [the] tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of Hebrews; as to [the] law, a Pharisee; 6as to zeal, persecuting the assembly; as to righteousness which [is] in [the] law, found blameless;"
Philippians,3,8,"But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them to be filth, that I may gain Christ; 9and that I may be found in him, not having my righteousness, which [would be] on the principle of law, but that which is by faith of Christ, the righteousness which [is] of God through faith, 10to know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death, 11if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among [the] dead. Pressing on toward the Goal"
Philippians,3,12,"Not that I have already obtained [the prize], or am already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may get"
Philippians,3,13,"Brethren, I do not count to have got possession myself; but one thing—forgetting the things behind, and stretching"
Philippians,3,14,"I pursue, [looking] towards [the] goal, for the prize of the calling on high"
Philippians,3,15,"As many therefore as [are] perfect, let us be thus minded; and if ye are any"
Philippians,3,16,"But whereto we have attained, [let us] walk in the same steps. Citizenship in Heaven"
Philippians,3,17,"Be imitators [all] together of me, brethren, and fix your eyes on those walking thus as you have us for a model; 18(for many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they [are] the enemies of the cross of Christ: 19whose end [is] destruction, whose god [is] the belly, and [their] glory in their shame, who mind earthly things:) 20for our commonwealth has its existence in [the] heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ [as] Saviour, 21who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory, according to the working of [the] power which he has even to subdue all things to himself."
Philippians,4,1,"So that, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, thus stand fast in [the] Lord, beloved."
Philippians,4,2,"I exhort Euodia, and exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in [the] Lord; 3yea, I ask thee also, true yokefellow, assist them, who have contended along with me in the glad tidings, with Clement also, and my other fellow-labourers, whose names [are] in [the] book of life."
Philippians,4,4,"Rejoice in [the] Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice."
Philippians,4,5,Let your gentleness be known of all men. The
Philippians,4,6,"Be careful about nothing; but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; 7and the peace of God, which surpasses every understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts by Christ Jesus."

Philippians,4,15,"And know also ye, O Philippians, that in [the] beginning of the gospel, when I came out of Macedonia, no assembly communicated [anything] to me in [the] way of giving and receiving save ye alone; 16for"
Philippians,4,17,"Not that I seek gift, but I seek"
Philippians,4,18,"But I have all things in full supply and abound; I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [sent] from you, an odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice,"
Philippians,4,19,But my God shall abundantly supply all your need according to his riches in glory
Philippians,4,20,But to our God and Father [be] glory to the ages of ages. Amen. Final Greetings (Ephesians 6:21–24; 2 Timothy 4:19–22)
Philippians,4,21,Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who [are] with me salute you.

Colossians,1,3,"We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ continually [when] praying for you, 4having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which ye have towards all the saints, 5on account of the hope which [is] laid up for you in the heavens; of which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the glad tidings, 6which are come to you, as [they are] in all the world, [and] are bearing fruit and growing, even as also among you, from the day ye heard [them] and knew indeed the grace of God, in truth: 7even as ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-bondman, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you, 8who has also manifested to us your love in [the] Spirit."
Colossians,1,9,"For this reason we also, from the day we heard [of your faith and love], do not cease praying and asking for you, to the end that ye may be filled with the full knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, 10[so as] to walk worthily of the Lord unto all well-pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and growing by the true knowledge of God; 11strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory unto all endurance and longsuffering with joy; 12giving thanks to the Father, who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light, 13who has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and translated [us] into the kingdom of the Son of his love: 14in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins; The Supremacy of the Son (Hebrews 1:1–14) 15who is image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation; 16because by him were created all things, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones,"

Colossians,1,21,"And you, who once were alienated and enemies in mind by wicked works, yet now has it reconciled 22in the body of his flesh through death; to present you holy and unblamable and irreproachable before it, 23if indeed ye abide in the faith founded and firm, and not moved away from the hope of the glad tidings, which ye have heard, which have been proclaimed in the whole creation which [is] under heaven, of which I Paul became minister. Paul’s Suffering for the Church (2 Corinthians 11:16–33)"
Colossians,1,24,"Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly; 25of which I became minister, according to the dispensation of God which [is] given me towards you to complete the word of God, 26the mystery which [has been] hidden from ages and from generations, but has now been made manifest to his saints; 27to whom God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you the hope of glory: 28whom we announce, admonishing every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, to the end that we may present every man perfect in Christ."

Colossians,2,13,"And you, being dead in offences and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has quickened together with him, having forgiven us all the offences; 14having effaced the handwriting in ordinances which [stood out] against us, which was contrary to us, he has taken it also out of the way, having nailed it to the cross; 15having spoiled principalities and authorities, he made a show of them publicly, leading them in triumph by it."

1 Timothy,6,3,"If any one teach differently, and do not accede to sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which [is] according to piety, 4he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and disputes of words, out of which arise envy, strife, injurious words, evil suspicions, 5constant quarrellings of men corrupted in mind and destitute of the truth, holding gain to be [the end of] piety. Godliness with Contentment"
1 Timothy,6,6,But piety with contentment is great gain.

1 Timothy,6,11,"But thou, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance,"
1 Timothy,6,12,"Strive earnestly [in] the good conflict of faith. Lay hold of eternal life, to which"
1 Timothy,6,13,"I enjoin thee before God who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession, 14that thou keep the commandment spotless, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; 15which in its own time the blessed and only Ruler shall shew, the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship; 16who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see; to whom [be] honour and eternal might. Amen. A Charge to the Rich (Proverbs 23:1–5; James 5:1–6)"
1 Timothy,6,17,"Enjoin on those rich in the present age not to be high-minded, nor to trust on the uncertainty of riches; but in the God who affords us all things richly for [our] enjoyment; 18to do good, to be rich in good works, to be liberal in distributing, disposed to communicate [of their substance], 19laying by for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold of [what is] really life. Guard the Faith"
1 Timothy,6,20,"O Timotheus, keep the entrusted deposit, avoiding profane, vain babblings, and oppositions of false- named knowledge, 21of which some having made profession, have missed the faith. Grace [be] with thee."
2 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God’s will, according to promise of life, the [life] which [is] in Christ Jesus, 2to Timotheus, [my] beloved child: grace, mercy, peace, from God [the] Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord. Faithfulness under Persecution (Matthew 10:16–25)"
2 Timothy,1,3,"I am thankful to God, whom I serve from [my] forefathers with pure conscience, how unceasingly I have the remembrance of thee in my supplications night and day, 4earnestly desiring to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; 5calling to mind the unfeigned faith which [has been] in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that in thee also."
2 Timothy,1,6,For which cause I put thee in mind to rekindle the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my

2 Timothy,1,8,"Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but suffer evil along with the glad tidings, according to the power of God; 9who has saved us, and has called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to [his] own purpose and grace, which [was] given to us in Christ Jesus before [the] ages of time, 10but has been made manifest now by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has annulled death, and brought to light life and incorruptibility by the"
2 Timothy,1,12,"For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep for that day the deposit I have entrusted to him. Holding to Sound Teaching"

2 Timothy,2,11,"The word [is] faithful; for if we have died together with [him], we shall also live together; 12if we endure, we shall also reign together; if we deny, he also will deny us; 13if we are unfaithful, he abides faithful, for he cannot deny himself. The Lord’s Approved Workman"
2 Timothy,2,14,"Of these things put in remembrance, testifying earnestly before the Lord not to have disputes of"
2 Timothy,2,15,"Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God, a workman that has not to be ashamed, cutting in a straight line the word of truth."

2 Timothy,2,21,"If therefore one shall have purified himself from these, [in separating himself from them], he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master,"
2 Timothy,2,22,"But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace,"
2 Timothy,2,23,"But foolish and senseless questionings avoid,"
2 Timothy,2,24,"And a bondman of [the] Lord ought not to contend, but be gentle towards all; apt to teach; forbearing; 25in meekness setting right those who oppose, if God perhaps may sometime give them repentance to acknowledgment of [the] truth, 26and that they may awake up out of the snare of the devil, [who are] taken by him, for his will."
2 Timothy,3,1,"But this know, that in [the] last days difficult times shall be there; 2for men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, evil speakers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, profane, 3without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, of unsubdued passions, savage, having no love for what is good, 4traitors, headlong, of vain pretensions, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; 5having a"

2 Timothy,3,9,"But they shall not advance farther; for their folly shall be completely manifest to all, as that of those also became. All Scripture Is God-Breathed (Hebrews 4:12–16)"
2 Timothy,3,10,"But thou hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance, 11persecutions, sufferings: what [sufferings] happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium,"

Titus,1,1,"Paul, bondman of God, and apostle of Jesus Christ according to [the] faith of God’s elect, and knowledge of [the] truth which [is] according to piety; 2in [the] hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages of time, 3but has manifested in its own due season his word, in [the] proclamation with which I have been entrusted, according to [the] commandment of our Saviour God; 4to Titus, my own child according to [the] faith common [to us]: Grace and peace from God [the] Father, and Christ Jesus our Saviour. Appointing Elders on Crete (1 Timothy 3:1–7; 1 Peter 5:1–4)"
Titus,1,5,"For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest go on to set right what remained [unordered], and establish elders in each city, as I had ordered thee: 6if any one be free from all charge [against"
Titus,1,7,"For the overseer must be free from all charge [against him] as God’s steward; not headstrong, not passionate, not disorderly through wine, not a striker, not seeking gain by base means; 8but hospitable, a lover of goodness, discreet, just, pious, temperate, 9clinging to the faithful word according to the doctrine taught, that he may be able both to encourage with sound teaching and refute gainsayers. Correcting False Teachers (1 Timothy 1:3–11)"
Titus,1,10,"For there are many and disorderly vain speakers and deceivers of people’s minds, specially those of [the] circumcision, 11who must have their mouths stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things"
Titus,1,12,"One of themselves, a prophet of their own,"
Titus,1,13,"This testimony is true; for which cause rebuke them severely, that they may be sound in the faith, 14not turning [their] minds to Jewish"
Titus,1,15,All things [are] pure to the pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving nothing [is] pure; but both their mind and their conscience are
Titus,1,16,"They profess to know God, but in works deny [him], being abominable, and disobedient, and found worthless as to every good work."
Titus,2,1,"But do thou speak the things that become sound teaching; 2that the elder men be sober, grave, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience; 3that the elder women in like manner be in deportment as becoming those who have to say to sacred things, not slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is right; 4that they may admonish the young women to be attached to [their] husbands, to be attached to [their] children, 5discreet, chaste, diligent in home work, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of."
Titus,2,6,"The younger men in like manner exhort to be discreet: 7in all things affording thyself as a pattern of good works; in teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, 8a sound word, not to be condemned; that he who is opposed may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us: 9bondmen to be subject to their own masters, to make themselves acceptable in everything; not gainsaying; 10not robbing [their masters], but shewing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the teaching which [is] of our Saviour God in all things. God’s Grace Brings Salvation"
Titus,2,11,"For the grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared, 12teaching us that, having denied impiety and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and justly, and piously in the present course of things, 13awaiting the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ; 14who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all lawlessness, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous for good works."
Titus,2,15,"These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise thee."
Titus,3,1,"Put them in mind to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient to rule, to be ready to do every good work, 2to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, [to be] mild, shewing all meekness towards all men."

Titus,3,4,"But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared, 5not on the principle of works which [have been done] in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through [the] washing of regeneration and renewal of [the] Holy Spirit, 6which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 7that, having been justified by his grace, we should become heirs"
Titus,3,8,"The word [is] faithful, and I desire that thou insist strenuously on these things, that they who have believed God may take care to pay diligent attention to good works. These things are good and profitable to men. Avoid Divisions (Romans 16:17–20)"
Titus,3,9,"But foolish questions, and genealogies, and strifes, and contentions about the law, shun; for they are"

Philemon,1,7,"For we have great thankfulness and encouragement through thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. Paul’s Appeal for Onesimus"
Philemon,1,8,"Wherefore having much boldness in Christ to enjoin thee what is fitting, 9for love’s sake I rather exhort, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also prisoner of Jesus Christ."
Philemon,1,10,"I exhort thee for my child, whom I have begotten in [my] bonds, Onesimus, 11once unserviceable to thee, but now serviceable to thee and to me: 12whom I have sent back to thee: [but do thou receive] him, that is, my bowels: 13whom I was desirous of keeping with myself, that for thee he might minister to me in the bonds of the glad tidings; 14but I have wished to do nothing without thy mind, that thy good might not be as of necessity but of willingness: 15for perhaps for this reason he has been separated [from thee] for a time, that thou mightest possess him fully for ever; 16not any longer as a bondman, but above a bondman, a beloved brother, specially to me, and how much rather to thee, both in [the] flesh and in [the] Lord?"
Philemon,1,17,"If therefore thou holdest me to be a partner [with thee], receive him as me; 18but if he have wronged"
Philemon,1,19,I Paul have written [it] with mine own hand; I will repay [it]: that I say not to thee that thou owest even thine own self also to me.
Philemon,1,20,"Yea, brother, I would have profit of thee in [the] Lord: refresh my bowels in Christ."
Philemon,1,21,"Being confident of thine obedience, I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say."
Philemon,1,22,But withal prepare me also a lodging; for I hope that I shall be granted to you through your prayers. Additional Greetings

Hebrews,1,1,"God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, 2at the end of these days has spoken to us in [the person of the] Son, whom he has established heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; 3who being [the] effulgence of his glory and [the] expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having made [by himself] the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high, 4taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they."
Hebrews,1,5,"For to which of the angels said he ever, Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten thee? and again, I will be to him for father, and he shall be to me for son? 6and again, when he brings in the firstborn into the habitable world, he says, And let all God’s angels worship him."
Hebrews,1,7,"And as to the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire; 8but as to the Son, Thy throne, O God, [is] to the age of the age, and a sceptre of uprightness [is] the sceptre of thy kingdom."
Hebrews,1,9,"Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy companions."
Hebrews,1,10,"And, Thou in the beginning, Lord, hast founded the earth, and works of thy hands are the heavens."
Hebrews,1,11,"They shall perish, but thou continuest still; and they all shall grow old as a garment, 12and as a covering shalt thou roll them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the Same, and thy years shall not fail."
Hebrews,1,13,"But as to which of the angels said he ever, Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet?"
Hebrews,1,14,"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?"
Hebrews,2,1,"For this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things [we have] heard, lest in any way"
Hebrews,2,2,"For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution, 3how shall we escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in being spoken [of] by the Lord, has been confirmed"
Hebrews,2,4,"God bearing, besides, witness with [them] to [it], both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of [the] Holy Spirit, according to his will? Jesus like His Brothers"
Hebrews,2,5,"For he has not subjected to angels the habitable world which is to come, of which we speak; 6but one has testified somewhere, saying, What is man, that thou rememberest him, or son of man that thou visitest him?"
Hebrews,2,7,"Thou hast made him some little inferior to the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, [and hast set him over the works of thy hands;] 8thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in subjecting all things to him, he has left nothing unsubject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him, 9but we see Jesus, who [was] made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; so that by the grace of God he should taste death for every thing."
Hebrews,2,10,"For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons"
Hebrews,2,11,"For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified [are] all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 12saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in [the] midst of [the] assembly will I sing thy praises."
Hebrews,2,13,"And again, I will trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children which God has given me."
Hebrews,2,14,"Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil; 15and might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to"
Hebrews,2,16,"For he does not indeed take hold of angels [by the hand], but he takes hold of the seed of"
Hebrews,2,17,"Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like to [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people; 18for, in that himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those that are being tempted."
Hebrews,3,1,"Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of [the] heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus, 2who is faithful to him that has constituted him, as Moses also in all his house."
Hebrews,3,3,"For he has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has built it has"
Hebrews,3,4,For every house is built by some one; but he who has built all things
Hebrews,3,5,"And Moses indeed [was] faithful in all his house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken after; 6but Christ, as Son over his house, whose house are we, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end. Do Not Harden Your Hearts (Psalm 95:1–11)"
Hebrews,3,7,"Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice, 8harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness; 9where your fathers tempted [me], by proving [me], and saw my works forty years."
Hebrews,3,10,"Wherefore I was wroth with this generation, and said, They always err in heart; and they have not known my ways; 11so I swore in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest. The Peril of Unbelief"
Hebrews,3,12,"See, brethren, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from [the]"
Hebrews,3,13,"But encourage yourselves each day, as long as it is called To-day, that none of you be"
Hebrews,3,14,"For we are become companions of the Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of the assurance firm to the end; 15in that it is said, To-day if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation; 16(for who was it, who, having heard, provoked? but [was it] not all who came out of Egypt by Moses?"
Hebrews,3,17,"And with whom was he wroth forty years? [Was it] not with those who had sinned, whose carcases"
Hebrews,3,18,"And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to those"
Hebrews,3,19,And we see that they could not enter in on account of unbelief;)
Hebrews,4,1,"Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem"
Hebrews,4,2,"For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard."
Hebrews,4,3,"For we enter into the rest who have believed; as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest; although the works had been completed from [the] foundation of [the] world."
Hebrews,4,4,"For he has said somewhere of the seventh [day] thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all"
Hebrews,4,6,"Seeing therefore it remains that some enter into it, and those who first received the glad tidings did not enter in on account of not hearkening to the word, 7again he determines a certain day, saying, in David, ‘To-day,’ after so long a time; (according as it has been said before), To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
Hebrews,4,8,"For if Jesus had brought them into rest, he would not have spoken afterwards about another day."
Hebrews,4,9,There remains then a sabbatism to the people of God.
Hebrews,4,10,"For he that has entered into his rest, he also"
Hebrews,4,11,"Let us therefore use diligence to enter into that rest, that no one may fall after the same example of not hearkening to the word. The Living Word (2 Timothy 3:10–17)"
Hebrews,4,12,"For the word of God [is] living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to [the] division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and"
Hebrews,4,13,"And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things [are] naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do."
Hebrews,4,14,"Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let"
Hebrews,4,15,"For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities,"
Hebrews,4,16,"Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help."
Hebrews,5,1,"For every high priest taken from amongst men is established for men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; 2being able to exercise forbearance towards the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is clothed with infirmity; 3and, on account of this [infirmity], he ought,"
Hebrews,5,4,"And no one takes the honour to himself but [as] called by God, even as Aaron also."
Hebrews,5,5,"Thus the Christ also has not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, Thou art my Son, I have to-day begotten thee."
Hebrews,5,6,"Even as also in another [place] he says, Thou [art] a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec."
Hebrews,5,7,"Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out of death, with strong crying and tears; (and having been heard because of his piety;) 8though he were Son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered; 9and having been perfected, became to all them that obey him, author of eternal salvation; 10addressed by God [as] high priest according to the order of Melchisedec. Milk and Solid Food (1 Corinthians 3:1–9)"
Hebrews,5,11,"Concerning whom we have much to say, and hard to be interpreted in speaking [of it], since ye are"

Hebrews,5,13,"For every one that partakes of milk [is] unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe; 14but solid food belongs to full-grown men, who, on account of habit, have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil."
Hebrews,6,1,"Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us go on [to what belongs] to full growth, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God, 2of [the] doctrine of washings, and of imposition of hands, and of resurrection of [the] dead, and of eternal"
Hebrews,6,4,"For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of [the] Holy Spirit, 5and have tasted the good word of God, and [the] works of power of [the] age to come, 6and have fallen away, crucifying for themselves [as they do] the Son of God, and making a show of"
Hebrews,6,7,"For ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God; 8but bringing forth thorns and briars, it is found worthless and nigh to a curse, whose end [is] to be burned."

Hebrews,6,11,"But we desire earnestly that each one of you shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end; 12that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the promises. God’s Unchangeable Promise"
Hebrews,6,13,"For God, having promised to Abraham, since he had no greater to swear by, swore by himself, 14saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee; 15and thus, having had"
Hebrews,6,16,"For men indeed swear by a greater, and with them the oath is a"
Hebrews,6,17,"Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath, 18that by two unchangeable things, in which [it was] impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us, 19which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil, 20where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec."
Hebrews,7,1,"For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from smiting the kings, and blessed him; 2to whom Abraham gave also the tenth portion of all; first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace; 3without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually."
Hebrews,7,4,"Now consider how great this [personage] was, to whom [even] the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth"
Hebrews,7,5,"And they indeed from among the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is from their brethren, though these are come out of the loins of Abraham: 6but he who has no genealogy from them has tithed"
Hebrews,7,7,"But beyond all gainsaying, the inferior is blessed"
Hebrews,7,8,"And here dying men receive tithes; but there [one] of whom the witness is that he lives; 9and, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, who received tithes, has been made to pay tithes."
Hebrews,7,10,For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him. A Superior Priesthood
Hebrews,7,11,"If indeed then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for the people had their law given to them in connexion with it, what need [was there] still that a different priest should arise according to the"
Hebrews,7,12,"For, the priesthood being changed,"
Hebrews,7,13,"For he, of whom these things are said, belongs"
Hebrews,7,14,For it is
Hebrews,7,15,"And it is yet more abundantly evident, since a different priest arises according to the similitude of Melchisedec, 16who has been constituted not according to law of fleshly commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life."
Hebrews,7,17,"For it is borne witness, Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec."
Hebrews,7,18,"For there is a setting aside of the commandment going before for its weakness and unprofitableness, 19(for the law perfected nothing,) and the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God."
Hebrews,7,20,"And by how much [it was] not without the swearing of an oath; 21(for they are become priests without the swearing of an oath, but he with the swearing of an oath, by him who said, as to him, The Lord has sworn, and will not repent [of it], Thou [art] priest for ever [according to the order of Melchisedec];) 22by so much Jesus became surety of a better covenant."
Hebrews,7,23,"And they have been many priests, on account of being hindered from continuing by death; 24but he,"
Hebrews,7,25,"Whence also he is able to save completely those who approach by him to God, always living to intercede for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens: 27who has not day by day need, as the high priests, first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, then [for] those of the people; for this he did once for all [in] having offered up"
Hebrews,7,28,"For the law constitutes men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the swearing of the oath which [is] after the law, a Son perfected for ever."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now a summary of the things of which we are speaking [is], We have such a one high priest who has sat down on [the] right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens; 2minister of the holy places"
Hebrews,8,3,For every high priest is constituted for the offering both of gifts and sacrifices; whence it is needful that this one also should
Hebrews,8,4,"If then indeed he were upon earth, he would not even be a priest, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law, 5(who serve the representation and shadow of heavenly things, according as Moses was oracularly told [when] about to make the tabernacle; for See, saith He, that thou make all things according to the pattern which has been shewn to thee in the mountain.) The New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:26–40)"
Hebrews,8,6,"But now he has got a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is mediator of a better covenant, which is established on the footing of better promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that first was faultless, place had not been sought for a second."
Hebrews,8,8,"For finding fault, he says to them, Behold, days come, saith the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant as regards the house of Israel, and as regards the house of Juda; 9not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in [the] day of my taking their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in my covenant, and I did not regard them, saith [the] Lord."
Hebrews,8,10,"Because this [is] the covenant that I will covenant to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: Giving my laws into their mind, I will write them also upon their hearts; and I will be to them for God, and they shall be to me for people."
Hebrews,8,11,"And they shall not teach each his fellow-citizen, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; because all shall know me in themselves, from [the] little one [among them] unto [the] great among them."
Hebrews,8,12,"Because I will be merciful to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more."
Hebrews,8,13,"In that he says New, he has made the first old; but that which grows old and aged [is] near disappearing."
Hebrews,9,1,"The first therefore also indeed had ordinances of service, and the sanctuary, a worldly one."
Hebrews,9,2,"For a tabernacle was set up; the first, in which [were] both the candlestick and the table and the exposition of the loaves, which is called Holy; 3but after the second veil a tabernacle which is called Holy of holies, 4having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, covered round in every part with gold, in which [were] the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant; 5and above over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat; concerning which it is not now [the time] to speak in detail."
Hebrews,9,6,"Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times, accomplishing the services; 7but into the second, the high priest only, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people: 8the Holy Spirit shewing this, that the way of the [holy of] holies has not yet been made manifest while as yet the first tabernacle has [its] standing; 9the which [is] an image for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices, unable to perfect as to conscience him that worshipped, are offered, 10[consisting] only of meats and drinks and divers washings, ordinances of flesh, imposed until [the] time of setting things right. Redemption through His Blood"
Hebrews,9,11,"But Christ being come high priest of the good things to come, by the better and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, (that is, not of this creation,) 12nor by blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, has entered in once for all into the [holy of] holies, having found an eternal"
Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls, and a heifer’s ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh, 14how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship [the] living God?"
Hebrews,9,15,"And for this reason he is mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. 16(For where [there is] a testament, the death of the testator must needs come"
Hebrews,9,17,"For a testament [is] of force when men are dead, since it is in no way of force while the testator"
Hebrews,9,18,Whence neither the first was inaugurated without blood.
Hebrews,9,19,"For every commandment having been spoken according to [the] law by Moses to all the people; having taken the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,"
Hebrews,9,21,"And the tabernacle too and all the vessels of service he sprinkled in like manner with blood; 22and almost all things are purified with blood according to the law, and without blood-shedding there is no remission. 23[It was] necessary then that the figurative representations of the things in the heavens should be"
Hebrews,9,24,"For the Christ is not entered into holy places made with hand, figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us: 25nor in order that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with blood not his own; 26since he had [then] been obliged often to suffer from the foundation of the world. But now once in the consummation of the ages he"
Hebrews,9,27,"And forasmuch as it is the portion of men once to die, and after this judgment; 28thus the Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation."
Hebrews,10,1,"For the law, having a shadow of the coming good things, not the image itself of the things, can never,"
Hebrews,10,2,"Since, would they not indeed have ceased being offered, on account of the worshippers once purged having no"
Hebrews,10,3,But in these [there is] a calling to mind of sins yearly.
Hebrews,10,4,For blood of bulls and goats [is] incapable of taking away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"Wherefore coming into the world he says, Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not; but thou hast prepared me a body."
Hebrews,10,6,Thou tookest no pleasure in burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin.
Hebrews,10,7,"Then I said, Lo, I come (in [the] roll of the book it is written of me) to do, O God, thy will."
Hebrews,10,8,"Above, saying Sacrifices and offerings and burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou willedst not, neither tookest pleasure in (which are offered according to the law); 9then he said, Lo, I come to do thy will. He takes away the first that he may establish the second; 10by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."
Hebrews,10,11,"And every priest stands daily ministering, and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never"
Hebrews,10,12,"But he, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down in perpetuity at [the] right"
Hebrews,10,14,For
Hebrews,10,15,And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness [of it]; for after what was said:
Hebrews,10,16,"This [is] the covenant which I will establish towards them after those days, saith [the] Lord: Giving my laws into their hearts, I will write them also in their understandings; 17and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more."
Hebrews,10,18,"But where there [is] remission of these, [there is] no longer a sacrifice for sin. A Call to Persevere (Jude 1:17–23)"
Hebrews,10,19,"Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the [holy of] holies by the blood of Jesus, 20the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh, 21and [having] a great priest over the house of God, 22let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water."
Hebrews,10,23,"Let us hold fast the confession of the hope unwavering, (for he [is] faithful who has promised;) 24and let us consider one another for provoking to love and good works; 25not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom [is] with some; but encouraging [one another], and by so much the more as ye see the day drawing near."
Hebrews,10,26,"For where we sin wilfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains any sacrifice for sins, 27but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and heat of fire about to devour the"
Hebrews,10,28,"Any one that has disregarded Moses’ law dies without mercy on [the testimony of] two or three witnesses: 29of how much worse punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and esteemed the blood of the covenant, whereby he has been"
Hebrews,10,30,"For we know him that said, To me [belongs] vengeance; I will recompense, saith the Lord: and again, The Lord shall judge his people. 31[It is] a fearful thing falling into [the] hands of [the] living God."
Hebrews,10,32,"But call to mind the earlier days in which, having been enlightened, ye endured much conflict of sufferings; 33on the one hand, when ye were made a spectacle both in reproaches and afflictions; and"

Hebrews,10,38,"But the just shall live by faith; and, if he draw back, my soul does not take pleasure in him."
Hebrews,10,39,"But we are not drawers back to perdition, but of faith to saving [the] soul."
Hebrews,11,1,"Now faith is [the] substantiating of things hoped for, [the] conviction of things not seen."
Hebrews,11,2,For in [the power of] this the elders have obtained testimony.
Hebrews,11,3,"By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by [the] word of God, so that that which is seen should not take its origin from things which appear. The Faith of Abel, Enoch, Noah (Genesis 4–9)"

Hebrews,11,17,"By faith Abraham, [when] tried, offered up Isaac, and he who had received to himself the promises offered up his only begotten [son], 18as to whom it had been said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called: 19counting that God [was] able to raise [him] even from among [the] dead, whence also he received him in a figure.

Hebrews,11,39,"And these all, having obtained witness through faith, did not receive the promise,"

Hebrews,12,1,"Let us also therefore, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, laying aside every weight, and sin which so easily entangles us, run with endurance the race that lies before us, 2looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith: who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured [the] cross, having despised [the] shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."
Hebrews,12,3,"For consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself, that ye be not weary, fainting in your minds. God Disciplines His Sons"
Hebrews,12,4,"Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, wrestling against sin."
Hebrews,12,5,"And ye have quite forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons: My son, despise not [the] chastening of [the] Lord, nor faint [when] reproved by him; 6for whom [the] Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives."

Hebrews,12,14,"Pursue peace with all, and holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord: 15watching lest [there be] any one who lacks the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble [you], and many be defiled by it; 16lest [there be] any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one meal sold his birthright; 17for ye know that also afterwards, desiring to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, (for he found no place for repentance) although he sought it earnestly with tears. An Unshakable Kingdom (Exodus 20:18–21; Deuteronomy 5:22–33)"
Hebrews,12,18,"For ye have not come to [the mount] that might be touched and was all on fire, and to obscurity, and darkness, and tempest, 19and trumpet’s sound, and voice of words; which they that heard, excusing themselves, declined [the] word being addressed to them any more: 20(for they were not able to bear what was enjoined: And if a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned; 21and, so fearful was the sight, Moses said, I am exceedingly afraid and full of trembling;) 22but ye have come to mount Zion; and to [the] city of [the] living God, heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, 23the universal gathering; and to [the] assembly of the firstborn [who are] registered in heaven; and to God, judge of all; and to [the] spirits of just [men] made perfect; 24and to Jesus, mediator of a new covenant; and to [the] blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel."
Hebrews,12,25,"See that ye refuse not him that speaks. For if those did not escape who had refused him who uttered the oracles on earth, much more we who turn away from him [who does so] from heaven: 26whose voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, saying, Yet once will I shake not only the earth,"

James,2,1,"My brethren, do not have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [Lord] of glory, with respect of persons: 2for if there come unto your synagogue a man with a gold ring in splendid apparel, and a poor man also come in in vile apparel, 3and ye look upon him who wears the splendid apparel, and say, Do thou sit here well, and say to the poor, Do thou stand there, or sit here under my footstool: 4have ye not"

James,2,12,"So speak ye, and so act, as those that are to be judged by [the] law of liberty; 13for judgment [will be] without mercy to him that has shewn no mercy. Mercy glories over judgment. Faith and Works (Galatians 3:1–9)"
James,2,14,"What [is] the profit, my brethren, if any one say he have faith, but have not works? can faith save"
James,2,15,"Now if a brother or a sister is naked and destitute of daily food, 16and one from amongst you say to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled; but give not to them the needful things for the body,"
James,2,17,"So also faith, if it have not works, is dead by itself."
James,2,18,"But some one will say, Thou hast faith and I have works. Shew me thy faith without works, and I"

James,3,5,"Thus also the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. See how little a fire, how large a wood it kindles! 6and the tongue [is] fire, the world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set in our members, the defiler of the whole body,"
James,3,7,"For every species both of beasts and of birds, both of creeping things and of sea animals, is tamed and has been tamed by the human species; 8but the tongue can no one among men tame; [it is] an unsettled evil, full of death-bringing"
James,3,9,"Therewith bless we the Lord and Father, and therewith curse we men made after [the] likeness"
James,3,10,"Out of the same mouth goes forth blessing and cursing. It is not right, my brethren, that"
James,3,11,"Does the fountain, out of the same opening, pour forth sweet and bitter?"
James,3,12,"Can, my brethren, a fig produce olives, or a vine figs? Neither [can] salt [water] make sweet water. The Wisdom from Above"
James,3,13,"Who [is] wise and understanding among you; let him shew out of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom; 14but if ye have bitter emulation and strife in your hearts, do not boast and lie"
James,3,15,"This is not the wisdom which comes down from above, but earthly, natural, devilish."
James,3,16,"For where emulation and strife [are], there [is] disorder and every evil thing."
James,3,17,"But the wisdom from above first is pure, then peaceful, gentle, yielding, full of mercy and good fruits, unquestioning,"
James,3,18,But [the] fruit of righteousness in peace is sown for them that make peace.

James,5,17,"Elias was a man of like passions to us, and he prayed with prayer that it should not rain; and it did not rain upon the earth three years and six months; 18and again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth caused its fruit to spring forth. Restoring a Sinner"
James,5,19,"My brethren, if any one among you err from the truth, and one bring him back, 20let him know that he that brings back a sinner from [the] error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins."
1 Peter,1,1,"Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ, to [the] sojourners of [the] dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 2elect according to [the] foreknowledge of God [the] Father, by sanctification of [the] Spirit, unto [the] obedience and sprinkling of [the] blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied. A Living Hope"
1 Peter,1,3,"Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his great mercy, has begotten us again to a living hope through [the] resurrection of Jesus Christ from among [the] dead, 4to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance, reserved in [the] heavens for you, 5who are kept guarded by [the] power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in [the] last"
1 Peter,1,6,"Wherein ye exult, for a little while at present, if needed, put to grief by various trials, 7that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes, though it be proved by fire, be found to praise and glory and honour in [the] revelation of Jesus Christ: 8whom, having not seen, ye love; on whom [though] not now looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with [the] glory, 9receiving the end of your faith, [the] salvation of [your] souls."
1 Peter,1,10,"Concerning which salvation prophets, who have prophesied of the grace towards you, sought out and searched out; 11searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ which [was] in them pointed out, testifying before of the sufferings which [belonged] to Christ, and the glories after these."
1 Peter,1,12,"To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves but to you they ministered those things, which have now been announced to you by those who have declared to you the glad tidings by [the] Holy Spirit, sent from heaven, which angels desire to look into. A Call to Holiness (Hebrews 12:14–17)"
1 Peter,1,13,"Wherefore, having girded up the loins of your mind, [be] sober [and] hope with perfect stedfastness in the grace [which will be] brought to you at [the] revelation of Jesus Christ; 14as children of obedience, not conformed to [your] former lusts in your ignorance; 15but as he who has called you is holy, be ye also holy in all [your] conversation; 16because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy."
1 Peter,1,17,"And if ye invoke as Father him who, without regard of persons, judges according to the work of each, pass your time of sojourn in fear, 18knowing that ye have been redeemed, not by corruptible [things, as] silver or gold, from your vain conversation handed down from [your] fathers, 19but by precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, [the blood] of Christ, 20foreknown indeed before [the] foundation of [the] world, but who has been manifested at the end of times for your sakes, 21who by him do believe on God, who has raised him from among [the] dead and given him glory, that your faith and hope should be in God. The Enduring Word (Isaiah 40:6–8)"
1 Peter,1,22,"Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth to unfeigned brotherly love, love one another out of a pure heart fervently; 23being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by [the] living and abiding word of God."
1 Peter,1,24,"Because all flesh [is] as grass, and all its glory as [the] flower of grass. The grass has withered and [its] flower has fallen; 25but the word of [the] Lord abides for eternity. But this is the word which in the glad tidings [is] preached to you."
1 Peter,2,1,"Laying aside therefore all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings, 2as newborn babes desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation, 3if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord [is] good."
1 Peter,2,4,"To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious, 5yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,2,6,"Because it is contained in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Zion a corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be put to shame."
1 Peter,2,7,"To you therefore who believe [is] the preciousness; but to the disobedient, the stone which the builders cast away as worthless, this is become head of [the] corner, 8and a stone of stumbling and rock of offence; [who] stumble at the word, being disobedient to which also they have been appointed."
1 Peter,2,9,"But ye [are] a chosen race, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, that ye might set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light; 10who once [were] not a people, but now God’s people; who were not enjoying mercy, but now have found mercy."
1 Peter,2,11,"Beloved, I exhort [you], as strangers and sojourners, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 12having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that [as to that] in which they speak against you as evildoers, they may through [your] good works, [themselves] witnessing [them], glorify God in [the] day of visitation. Submission to Authorities (Romans 13:1–7)"
1 Peter,2,13,"Be in subjection [therefore] to every human institution for the Lord’s sake; whether to [the] king as supreme, 14or to rulers as sent by him, for vengeance on evildoers, and praise to them that do well."
1 Peter,2,15,"Because so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye put to silence the ignorance of senseless men;"
1 Peter,2,17,"Shew honour to all, love the brotherhood, fear God, honour the king."
1 Peter,2,18,"Servants, [be] subject with all fear to your masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the"
1 Peter,2,19,"For this [is] acceptable, if one, for conscience sake towards God, endure griefs, suffering"
1 Peter,2,20,"For what glory [is it], if sinning and being buffeted ye shall bear [it]? but if, doing good and suffering, ye shall bear [it], this is acceptable with God. Christ’s Example of Suffering (Isaiah 53:1–8)"
1 Peter,2,21,"For to this have ye been called; for Christ also has suffered for you, leaving you a model that ye should follow in his steps: 22who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth; 23who, [when] reviled, reviled not again; [when] suffering, threatened not; but gave [himself] over into the hands of him who judges righteously; 24who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, in order that, being"
1 Peter,2,25,"For ye were going astray as sheep, but have now returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls."
1 Peter,3,1,"Likewise, wives, [be] subject to your own husbands, that, even if any are disobedient to the word, they may be gained without [the] word by the conversation of the wives, 2having witnessed your pure conversation [carried out] in fear; 3whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel; 4but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible"
1 Peter,3,5,"For thus also the holy women who have hoped in God heretofore adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands; 6as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose children ye have become, doing good, and not fearing with any kind of consternation. 7[Ye] husbands likewise, dwell with [them] according to knowledge, as with a weaker, [even] the female, vessel, giving [them] honour, as also fellow-heirs of [the] grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered. Turning from Evil"
1 Peter,3,8,"Finally, [be] all of one mind, sympathising, full of brotherly love, tender hearted, humble minded; 9not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but on the contrary, blessing [others], because ye have been called to this, that ye should inherit blessing."
1 Peter,3,10,"For he that will love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no guile."
1 Peter,3,11,"And let him avoid evil, and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it; 12because [the] eyes of [the] Lord [are] on [the] righteous, and his ears towards their supplications; but [the] face of [the] Lord [is] against them that do evil."
1 Peter,3,13,And who shall injure you if ye have become imitators of that which [is] good? Suffering for Righteousness
1 Peter,3,14,"But if also ye should suffer for righteousness’ sake, blessed [are ye]; but be not afraid of their fear, neither be troubled; 15but sanctify [the] Lord the Christ in your hearts, and [be] always prepared to [give] an answer [to] every one that asks you to give an account of the hope that [is] in you, but with meekness and fear; 16having a good conscience, that [as to that] in which they speak against you as"
1 Peter,3,17,"For [it is] better, if the will of God should will it, to suffer [as] well-doers than [as] evildoers; 18for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, [the] just for [the] unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in flesh, but made alive in [the] Spirit, 19in which also going he preached to the spirits [which are] in prison, 20heretofore disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in [the] days of Noah while the ark was preparing, into which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water: 21which figure also now saves you, [even] baptism, not a putting away of [the] filth of flesh, but [the] demand as before God of a good conscience, by [the] resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22who is at [the] right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him."
1 Peter,4,1,"Christ, then, having suffered for us in [the] flesh, do ye also arm yourselves with the same mind; for he that has suffered in [the] flesh has done with sin, 2no longer to live the rest of [his] time in [the]"

1 Peter,4,6,"For to this [end] were the glad tidings preached to [the] dead also, that they might be judged, as regards men, after [the] flesh, but live, as regards God, after [the] Spirit."
1 Peter,4,7,"But the end of all things is drawn nigh: be sober therefore, and be watchful unto prayers; 8but before all things having fervent love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins; 9hospitable one to another, without murmuring; 10each according as he has received a gift, ministering it to one"
1 Peter,4,11,"If any one speak—as oracles of God; if any one minister—as of strength which God supplies; that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might for the ages of ages. Amen. Suffering as Christians"
1 Peter,4,12,"Beloved, take not [as] strange the fire [of persecution] which has taken place amongst you for [your] trial, as if a strange thing was happening to you; 13but as ye have share in the sufferings of Christ,"
1 Peter,4,14,"If ye are reproached in [the] name of Christ, blessed [are ye]; for the [Spirit] of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you:"
1 Peter,4,15,"Let none of you suffer indeed as murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or as overseer of other people’s matters; 16but if as a christian, let him"
1 Peter,4,17,"For the time of having the judgment begin from the house of God [is come]; but if first from us, what [shall be] the end of those who obey not the glad"
1 Peter,4,18,"And if the righteous is difficultly saved, where shall the impious and [the] sinner"
1 Peter,4,19,Wherefore also let them who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well- doing to a faithful Creator.
1 Peter,5,1,"The elders which [are] among you I exhort, who [am their] fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who also [am] partaker of the glory about to be revealed: 2shepherd the flock of God which [is] among you, exercising oversight, not by necessity, but willingly; not for base gain, but"
1 Peter,5,4,And when the chief shepherd is manifested ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory. Cast Your Cares on Him
1 Peter,5,5,"Likewise [ye] younger, be subject to [the] elder, and all of you bind on humility towards one another; for God sets himself against [the] proud, but to [the] humble gives grace."

2 Peter,1,3,"As his divine power has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us by glory and virtue, 4through which he has given to us the greatest and precious promises, that through these ye may become partakers of [the] divine nature, having escaped"
2 Peter,1,5,"But for this very reason also, using therewith all diligence, in your faith have also virtue, in virtue knowledge, 6in knowledge temperance, in temperance endurance, in endurance godliness, 7in godliness brotherly love, in brotherly love love: 8for these things existing and abounding in you make [you] to be neither idle nor unfruitful as regards the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; 9for he with whom these things are not present is blind, short-sighted, and"
2 Peter,1,10,"Wherefore the rather, brethren, use diligence to make your calling and election sure, for doing these things ye will never fall; 11for thus shall the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ be richly furnished unto you."
2 Peter,1,12,"Wherefore I will be careful to put you always in mind of these things, although knowing [them] and"
2 Peter,1,13,"But I account it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting [you] in remembrance, 14knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is speedily [to take place], as also our Lord Jesus Christ has manifested to me; 15but I will use diligence, that after my departure ye should have also, at any time, [in your power] to call to mind these things. Eyewitnesses of His Majesty (Matthew 17:1–13; Mark 9:1–13; Luke 9:28–36)"
2 Peter,1,16,"For we have not made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, following"
2 Peter,1,17,"For he received from God [the] Father honour and glory, such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight; 18and this voice we heard uttered from heaven, being with him on the holy mountain."
2 Peter,1,19,"And we have the prophetic word [made] surer, to which ye do well taking heed (as to a lamp shining in an obscure place) until [the] day dawn and [the] morning star arise in your hearts; 20knowing this first, that [the scope of] no prophecy of scripture is had from its own particular interpretation, 21for prophecy was not ever uttered by [the] will of man, but holy men of God spake under the power of [the] Holy Spirit."
2 Peter,2,1,"But there were false prophets also among the people, as there shall be also among you false teachers, who shall bring in by the bye destructive heresies, and deny the master that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction; 2and many shall follow their dissolute ways, through whom the way"
2 Peter,2,3,"And through covetousness, with well-turned words, will they make merchandise of you: for whom judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction slumbers not."
2 Peter,2,4,"For if God spared not [the] angels who had sinned, but having cast them down to the deepest pit of gloom has delivered them to chains of darkness [to be] kept for judgment; 5and spared not [the] old world, but preserved Noe, [the] eighth, a preacher of righteousness, having brought in [the] flood upon [the] world of [the] ungodly; 6and having reduced [the] cities of Sodom and Gomorrha to ashes, condemned [them] with an overthrow, setting [them as] an example to those that should [afterwards] live an ungodly life; 7and saved righteous Lot, distressed with the abandoned conversation of the godless, 8(for the righteous man through seeing and hearing, dwelling among them, tormented [his] righteous soul day after day with [their] lawless works,) 9[the] Lord knows [how] to deliver the godly out of trial, and to keep [the] unjust to [the] day of judgment [to be] punished; 10and specially those who walk after the flesh in [the] lust of uncleanness, and despise lordship. Bold [are they], self-willed; they do not fear speaking injuriously of dignities: 11when angels, who are greater"
2 Peter,2,12,"But these, as natural animals without reason, made to be caught and destroyed, speaking injuriously in things they are ignorant of, shall also perish in their own corruption, 13receiving [the] reward of unrighteousness; accounting ephemeral indulgence pleasure; spots and blemishes, rioting in their own deceits, feasting with you; 14having eyes full of adultery, and that cease not from sin, alluring unestablished souls; having a heart practised in covetousness, children of curse; 15having left [the] straight way they have gone astray, having followed in the path of Balaam [the son] of Bosor, who loved [the] reward of unrighteousness; 16but had reproof of his own wickedness—[the] dumb ass speaking with man’s voice forbad the folly of the prophet."
2 Peter,2,17,"These are springs without water, and mists driven by storm, to whom the gloom of darkness is"
2 Peter,2,18,"For [while] speaking great highflown words of vanity, they allure with [the] lusts of [the] flesh, by dissoluteness, those who have just fled those who walk in error, 19promising them liberty, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a man is subdued, by him is he"
2 Peter,2,20,"For if after having escaped the pollutions of the world through [the] knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, again entangled, they are subdued by these, their last"
2 Peter,2,21,"For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness,"
2 Peter,2,22,"But that [word] of the true proverb has happened to them: [The] dog [has] turned back to his own vomit; and, [The] washed sow to [her] rolling in mud."
2 Peter,3,1,"This, a second letter, beloved, I already write to you, in [both] which I stir up, in the way of putting you in remembrance, your pure mind, 2to be mindful of the words spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of the Lord and Saviour by your apostles; 3knowing this first, that there shall come at [the] close of the days mockers with mocking, walking according to their own lusts, 4and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for from the time the"
