Numbers,22,32,"And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me: 33and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain"

Joshua,9,3,"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai, 4they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wineskins, old and rent and bound up; 5and old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old"

Joshua,10,12,"Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon."
Joshua,10,13,"And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day."

Ruth,1,12,"Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have an husband to-night, and should also bear sons; 13would ye therefore tarry till they were grown? would ye therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of the LORD is gone forth against me."
Ruth,1,14,"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her."
Ruth,1,15,"And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god: return thou"

Ruth,3,17,"And she said, These six measures"
Ruth,3,18,"Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day."
Ruth,4,1,"Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside,"
Ruth,4,2,"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat"
Ruth,4,3,"And he said unto the near kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab,"
Ruth,4,4,"And I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying, Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it"
Ruth,4,5,"Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to"

Ruth,4,16,"And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it."
Ruth,4,17,"And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. The Line of David (Matthew 1:1–17; Luke 3:23–38)"
Ruth,4,18,"Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begat Hezron; 19and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab; 20and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon; 21and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed; 22and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David."
1 Samuel,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite: 2and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
1 Samuel,1,3,And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of

1 Samuel,1,6,"And her rival provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had"
1 Samuel,1,7,"And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so"
1 Samuel,1,8,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons? Hannah Prays for a Son"
1 Samuel,1,9,"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat"
1 Samuel,1,10,"And she was in bitterness of soul, and"
1 Samuel,1,11,"And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head."
1 Samuel,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth."
1 Samuel,1,13,"Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought"
1 Samuel,1,14,"And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine"
1 Samuel,1,15,"And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have"
1 Samuel,1,16,Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have

1 Samuel,1,18,"And she said, Let thy servant find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. The Birth of Samuel"
1 Samuel,1,19,"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came"
1 Samuel,1,20,"And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD."
1 Samuel,1,21,"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his"
1 Samuel,1,22,"But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever."
1 Samuel,1,23,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned"
1 Samuel,1,24,"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child"
1 Samuel,1,25,"And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli."
1 Samuel,1,26,"And she said, Oh my lord, as"
1 Samuel,1,27,For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: 28wherefore I also have granted him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he is granted to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.
1 Samuel,2,1,"And Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exulteth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation."
1 Samuel,2,2,There is none holy as the LORD; for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.
1 Samuel,2,3,"Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed."
1 Samuel,2,4,"The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength."
1 Samuel,2,5,"They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry have ceased: yea, the barren hath borne seven; and she that hath many children languisheth."
1 Samuel,2,6,"The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up."
1 Samuel,2,7,"The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, he also lifteth up."
1 Samuel,2,8,"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, he lifteth up the needy from the dunghill, to make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD’S, and he hath set the world upon them."
1 Samuel,2,9,"He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail."
1 Samuel,2,10,"They that strive with the LORD shall be broken to pieces; against them shall he thunder in heaven: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed."
1 Samuel,2,11,And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest. Eli’s Wicked Sons
1 Samuel,2,12,Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
1 Samuel,2,13,"And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; 14and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh"
1 Samuel,2,15,"Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh"
1 Samuel,2,16,"And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will"
1 Samuel,2,17,And the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
1 Samuel,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod."
1 Samuel,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her"
1 Samuel,2,20,"And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home."
1 Samuel,2,21,"And the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD."
1 Samuel,2,22,"Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with"
1 Samuel,2,23,"And he said unto them, Why do ye"
1 Samuel,2,24,"Nay, my sons; for it is no good"
1 Samuel,2,25,"If one man sin against another, God shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them."
1 Samuel,2,26,"And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men. A Prophecy against the House of Eli"
1 Samuel,2,27,"And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I reveal myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house? 28and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children"
1 Samuel,2,29,"Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the"
1 Samuel,2,30,"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be"

1 Samuel,2,32,"And thou shalt behold the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine"
1 Samuel,2,33,"And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their"
1 Samuel,2,34,"And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas;"
1 Samuel,2,35,"And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk"
1 Samuel,2,36,"And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread."
1 Samuel,3,1,And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.
1 Samuel,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, that he could not see,) 3and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep, in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was; 4that the LORD called Samuel:"
1 Samuel,3,5,"And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said,"
1 Samuel,3,6,"And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called"
1 Samuel,3,7,"Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the"
1 Samuel,3,8,"And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the"
1 Samuel,3,9,"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
1 Samuel,3,10,"And the LORD came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said,"
1 Samuel,3,11,"And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at"
1 Samuel,3,12,In that day I will perform against Eli all

1 Samuel,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. Samuel Shares the Vision"
1 Samuel,3,15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel"
1 Samuel,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here"
1 Samuel,3,17,"And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he"
1 Samuel,3,18,"And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good."
1 Samuel,3,19,"And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground."
1 Samuel,3,20,And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of
1 Samuel,3,21,And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
1 Samuel,4,1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and"
1 Samuel,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they"
1 Samuel,4,3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us today before the Philistines? Let as fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that it may come among us, and"
1 Samuel,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which sitteth upon the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God."
1 Samuel,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great"
1 Samuel,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that"
1 Samuel,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore."
1 Samuel,4,8,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that
1 Samuel,4,9,"Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight."
1 Samuel,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent: and there"
1 Samuel,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain. The Death of Eli"
1 Samuel,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes"
1 Samuel,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon his seat by the way side watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it,"
1 Samuel,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise"
1 Samuel,4,15,Now Eli was ninety and eight years old;
1 Samuel,4,16,"And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of"
1 Samuel,4,17,"And he that brought the tidings answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark"
1 Samuel,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years."
1 Samuel,4,19,"And his daughter in law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she"
1 Samuel,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son. But she answered"
1 Samuel,4,21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from"
1 Samuel,4,22,"And she said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken."
1 Samuel,5,1,"Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod."
1 Samuel,5,2,And
1 Samuel,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground"
1 Samuel,5,4,"And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold;"
1 Samuel,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day."
1 Samuel,5,6,"But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them"
1 Samuel,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon as, and"
1 Samuel,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of"
1 Samuel,5,9,"And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great discomfiture: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and tumours brake out"
1 Samuel,5,10,"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us,"
1 Samuel,5,11,"They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city, the hand of God"
1 Samuel,5,12,And the men that died not were smitten with the tumours: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1 Samuel,6,1,And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
1 Samuel,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? shew us wherewith"
1 Samuel,6,3,"And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a guilt offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to"

1 Samuel,6,7,"Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them: 8and take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a guilt"
1 Samuel,6,9,"And see, if it goeth up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us."
1 Samuel,6,10,"And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home: 11and they put the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the"
1 Samuel,6,12,"And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh."
1 Samuel,6,13,And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their

1 Samuel,6,15,"And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day"
1 Samuel,6,16,"And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day."
1 Samuel,6,17,"And these are the golden tumours which the Philistines returned for a guilt offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; 18and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities and of country villages: even unto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD, which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite."
1 Samuel,6,19,"And he smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people seventy men, and fifty thousand men: and the people mourned, because the"

1 Samuel,6,21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you."
1 Samuel,7,1,"And the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the"
1 Samuel,7,2,"And it came to pass, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,3,"And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your heart, then put away the strange gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts"
1 Samuel,7,4,"Then the children of Israel did put away the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only."
1 Samuel,7,5,"And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you unto the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,6,"And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah."
1 Samuel,7,7,"And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of"

1 Samuel,8,10,And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.
1 Samuel,8,11,"And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots: 12and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands and captains of fifties; and he will set some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his"

1 Samuel,9,12,"And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before thee: make haste now, for he is come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place: 13as soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and"
1 Samuel,9,14,"And they went up to the city; and as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place."
1 Samuel,9,15,"Now the LORD had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,"
1 Samuel,9,16,"Tomorrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over my people Israel, and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked"
1 Samuel,9,17,"And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man of whom I spake to thee! this same shall have authority over my people."
1 Samuel,9,18,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house"
1 Samuel,9,19,"And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me today: and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart."
1 Samuel,9,20,"And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found."
1 Samuel,9,21,"And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?"
1 Samuel,9,22,"And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them"
1 Samuel,9,23,And Samuel
1 Samuel,9,24,"And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day."
1 Samuel,9,25,"And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul upon the"
1 Samuel,9,26,"And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out"
1 Samuel,9,27,"As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still at this time, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God."
1 Samuel,10,1,"Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not that"
1 Samuel,10,2,"When thou art departed from me today, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left"
1 Samuel,10,3,"Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the oak of Tabor, and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine: 4and they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of"
1 Samuel,10,5,"After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall be prophesying: 6and the spirit of the LORD will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man."
1 Samuel,10,7,"And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is"
1 Samuel,10,8,"And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come unto thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do. Samuel’s Signs Fulfilled"
1 Samuel,10,9,"And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart:"
1 Samuel,10,10,"And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them."
1 Samuel,10,11,"And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul"
1 Samuel,10,12,"And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father?"
1 Samuel,10,13,"And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place."
1 Samuel,10,14,"And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses:"
1 Samuel,10,15,"And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I"
1 Samuel,10,16,"And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not. Saul Proclaimed King"
1 Samuel,10,17,"And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpah; 18and he said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you: 19but ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands."
1 Samuel,10,20,"So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken."
1 Samuel,10,21,"And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families, and the family of the Matrites was taken: and Saul"
1 Samuel,10,22,"Therefore they asked of the LORD further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid"
1 Samuel,10,23,And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the
1 Samuel,10,24,"And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king."
1 Samuel,10,25,"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before"
1 Samuel,10,26,And Saul also went to his
1 Samuel,10,27,"But certain sons of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace."
1 Samuel,11,1,"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh"
1 Samuel,11,2,"And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay"
1 Samuel,11,3,"And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’ respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel: and then, if there be none to save us, we"
1 Samuel,11,4,"Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spake these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept."
1 Samuel,11,5,"And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that"
1 Samuel,11,6,And the spirit of God came mightily
1 Samuel,11,7,"And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto"
1 Samuel,11,8,"And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of"
1 Samuel,11,9,"And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance. And the messengers"
1 Samuel,11,10,"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow"
1 Samuel,11,11,"And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together. Saul Confirmed as King"
1 Samuel,11,12,"And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that"
1 Samuel,11,13,"And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for today the LORD hath wrought deliverance in Israel."
1 Samuel,11,14,"Then said Samuel to the people, Come and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there."
1 Samuel,11,15,And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
1 Samuel,12,1,"And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me,"
1 Samuel,12,2,"And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and gray-headed; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth unto"

1 Samuel,12,4,"And they said,"
1 Samuel,12,5,"And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they said, He is witness."
1 Samuel,12,6,"And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought"
1 Samuel,12,7,"Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers."
1 Samuel,12,8,"When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses"
1 Samuel,12,9,"But they forgat the LORD their God, and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against"
1 Samuel,12,10,"And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our"
1 Samuel,12,11,"And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled in safety."
1 Samuel,12,12,"And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto"
1 Samuel,12,13,"Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for: and, behold, the LORD hath set"
1 Samuel,12,14,"If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and hearken unto his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of the LORD your God, well: 15but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was"
1 Samuel,12,16,"Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before"
1 Samuel,12,17,"Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call unto the LORD, that he may send thunder and rain; and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the"
1 Samuel,12,18,So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
1 Samuel,12,19,"And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not:"
1 Samuel,12,20,"And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have indeed done all this evil: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart; 21and turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit"
1 Samuel,12,22,For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake:
1 Samuel,12,23,"Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good"
1 Samuel,12,24,"Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how"
1 Samuel,12,25,"But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king."
1 Samuel,13,1,Saul was thirty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years over Israel.
1 Samuel,13,2,"And Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest"
1 Samuel,13,3,"And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying,"
1 Samuel,13,4,"And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal."
1 Samuel,13,5,"And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came"
1 Samuel,13,6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets,"
1 Samuel,13,7,"Now some of the Hebrews had gone over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. Saul’s Unlawful Sacrifice"
1 Samuel,13,8,"And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came"
1 Samuel,13,9,"And Saul said, Bring hither the burnt offering to me, and the peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering."
1 Samuel,13,10,"And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold,"
1 Samuel,13,11,"And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash; 12therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the"
1 Samuel,13,13,"And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he"
1 Samuel,13,14,"But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee."
1 Samuel,13,15,"And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men. Israel without Weapons"
1 Samuel,13,16,"And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Geba of"
1 Samuel,13,17,"And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: 18and another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness."
1 Samuel,13,19,"Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears: 20but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock; 21yet they had a file for the"
1 Samuel,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found."
1 Samuel,13,23,And the garrison of the Philistines went out unto the pass of Michmash.
1 Samuel,14,1,"Now it fell upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on yonder side. But he told not his father."
1 Samuel,14,2,"And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men: 3and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And"
1 Samuel,14,4,"And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the"
1 Samuel,14,5,"The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba."
1 Samuel,14,6,"And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD"
1 Samuel,14,7,"And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn"
1 Samuel,14,8,"Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over"
1 Samuel,14,9,"If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come"
1 Samuel,14,10,"But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be the"
1 Samuel,14,11,And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the

1 Samuel,14,13,"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew them after"
1 Samuel,14,14,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land."
1 Samuel,14,15,"And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled: and the earth quaked; so there was an exceeding great trembling."
1 Samuel,14,16,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away,"
1 Samuel,14,17,"Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer"
1 Samuel,14,18,"And Saul said unto Ahijah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was there"
1 Samuel,14,19,"And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest,"
1 Samuel,14,20,"And Saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great"
1 Samuel,14,21,"Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about; even they also turned to be with the Israelites that"
1 Samuel,14,22,"Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them"
1 Samuel,14,23,So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth-aven. Jonathan Eats the Honey
1 Samuel,14,24,"And the men of Israel were distressed that day: but Saul adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people"
1 Samuel,14,25,And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground.
1 Samuel,14,26,"And when the people were come unto the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to"
1 Samuel,14,27,"But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in"
1 Samuel,14,28,"Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man"
1 Samuel,14,29,"Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey."
1 Samuel,14,30,"How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now hath there been no great slaughter among the Philistines."
1 Samuel,14,31,"And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint. 32and the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the"
1 Samuel,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have dealt treacherously: roll a"
1 Samuel,14,34,"And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with"
1 Samuel,14,35,And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.
1 Samuel,14,36,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God. The People Save Jonathan"
1 Samuel,14,37,"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the"
1 Samuel,14,38,"And Saul said, Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of"
1 Samuel,14,39,"For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all"
1 Samuel,14,40,"Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee."
1 Samuel,14,41,"Therefore Saul said unto the LORD, the God of Israel, Shew the right. And Jonathan and Saul were"
1 Samuel,14,42,"And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken."
1 Samuel,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did"
1 Samuel,14,44,And
1 Samuel,14,45,"And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day."
1 Samuel,14,46,Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place. Saul’s Victories
1 Samuel,14,47,"Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah,"
1 Samuel,14,48,"And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them."
1 Samuel,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: 50and the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner"
1 Samuel,14,51,And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
1 Samuel,14,52,"And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him."
1 Samuel,15,1,"And Samuel said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel:"
1 Samuel,15,2,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he"
1 Samuel,15,3,"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass."
1 Samuel,15,4,"And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and"
1 Samuel,15,5,"And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley."
1 Samuel,15,6,"And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So"
1 Samuel,15,7,"And Saul Smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as"
1 Samuel,15,8,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and"
1 Samuel,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly. Samuel Denounces Saul"
1 Samuel,15,10,"Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,"
1 Samuel,15,11,"It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And"
1 Samuel,15,12,"And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument,"
1 Samuel,15,13,And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul
1 Samuel,15,14,"And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen"
1 Samuel,15,15,"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly"
1 Samuel,15,16,"Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on."
1 Samuel,15,17,"And Samuel said, Though thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the LORD anointed thee king over Israel; 18and the LORD sent thee on a journey,, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed. 19wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of the LORD?"
1 Samuel,15,20,"And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the"
1 Samuel,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,22,"And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."
1 Samuel,15,23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king. Saul’s Confession"
1 Samuel,15,24,"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD,"
1 Samuel,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee,"
1 Samuel,15,26,"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected"
1 Samuel,15,27,"And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt"
1 Samuel,15,28,"And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from"
1 Samuel,15,29,And also the Strength
1 Samuel,15,30,"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn"
1 Samuel,15,31,So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
1 Samuel,15,32,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him"
1 Samuel,15,33,"And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,34,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel,15,35,And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
1 Samuel,16,1,"And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for"

1 Samuel,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and"
1 Samuel,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. David Serves Saul"
1 Samuel,16,14,"Now the spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him."
1 Samuel,16,15,"And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee."

1 Samuel,18,5,"And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants."
1 Samuel,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music."
1 Samuel,18,7,"And the women sang one to another in their play, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands."

And David avoided out of his presence twice."
1 Samuel,18,12,"And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul."
1 Samuel,18,13,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out"

1 Samuel,18,26,"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son in law. And the days were not expired; 27and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king’s son in law. And"
1 Samuel,18,28,And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David;
1 Samuel,18,29,And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.
1 Samuel,18,30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by."

2 Samuel,14,19,"And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid; 20to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth."

2 Samuel,15,2,"And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him,"
2 Samuel,15,3,"And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear"

2 Samuel,17,14,"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom. Hushai’s Warning Saves David (Psalm 55:1–23)"
2 Samuel,17,15,Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests. Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel

2 Samuel,17,22,"Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan."
2 Samuel,17,23,"And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father."
2 Samuel,17,24,"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with"
2 Samuel,17,25,"And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah"
2 Samuel,17,26,And Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
2 Samuel,17,27,"And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, 28brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse, 29and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness."
2 Samuel,18,1,"And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of"

2 Samuel,18,4,"And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do."
2 Samuel,18,5,"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom."
2 Samuel,18,6,So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
2 Samuel,18,7,"And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter"
2 Samuel,18,8,For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country: and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
2 Samuel,18,9,"And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken"

2 Samuel,18,12,"And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none"

2 Samuel,18,15,"And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him."
2 Samuel,18,16,"And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back"
2 Samuel,18,17,"And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him"
2 Samuel,18,18,"Now Absalom in his life time had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called Absalom’s monument, unto this day. David Mourns for Absalom"

1 Kings,8,63,"And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house"
1 Kings,8,64,"The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings."
1 Kings,8,65,"So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days,"
1 Kings,8,66,"On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David his servant, and to Israel his people."

1 Kings,9,4,"And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments; 5then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever; according as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel."
1 Kings,9,6,"But if ye shall turn away from following me, ye or your children and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them: 7then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples:"
1 Kings,9,8,"And though this house be so high, yet shall every one that passeth by be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house? 9and they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, which brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought all this evil upon them.

Nehemiah,8,8,"And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading."
Nehemiah,8,9,"And Nehemiah, which was the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep."

Nehemiah,8,16,"So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and"
Nehemiah,8,17,"And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And"
Nehemiah,8,18,"Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly according unto the ordinance."
Nehemiah,9,1,"Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting,"

Nehemiah,9,4,"Then stood up upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God from everlasting to everlasting: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise."
Nehemiah,9,6,"Thou art the LORD, even thou alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee."
Nehemiah,9,7,"Then art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham; 8and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, even to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous."
Nehemiah,9,9,"And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea; 10and shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them; and didst get thee a name, as it is this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"Moreover thou leddest them in a pillar of cloud by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go."
Nehemiah,9,13,"Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments and true laws, good statutes and commandments: 14and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by the hand of Moses thy servant: 15and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commandedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst lifted up thine hand to give them."
Nehemiah,9,16,"But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments, 17and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy, and forsookest them not."
Nehemiah,9,18,"Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; 19yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go."
Nehemiah,9,20,"Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah,9,21,"Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not."
Nehemiah,9,22,"Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which thou didst allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it."
Nehemiah,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would."
Nehemiah,9,25,"And they took fenced cities, and a fat land and possessed houses full of good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them again unto thee, and they wrought great provocations."
Nehemiah,9,27,"Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies; 29and testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them,) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."
Nehemiah,9,30,"Yet many years didst thou bear with them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit through thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands."
Nehemiah,9,31,"Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou didst not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God."
Nehemiah,9,32,"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers; and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"Howbeit thou art just in all that is come upon us; for thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly: 34neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works."
Nehemiah,9,36,"Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it."
Nehemiah,9,37,"And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress."
Nehemiah,9,38,"And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, seal unto it."

Nehemiah,10,32,"Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God; 33for the shewbread, and for the continual meal offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God."

Nehemiah,13,6,"But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king, and after certain days asked I leave of the king: 7and I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber"
Nehemiah,13,8,And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household

Nehemiah,13,11,"Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place."
Nehemiah,13,12,Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
Nehemiah,13,13,"And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted"
Nehemiah,13,14,"Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances thereof. The Sabbath Restored (Jeremiah 17:19–27)"
Nehemiah,13,15,"In those days saw I in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses therewith; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold"
Nehemiah,13,16,"There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought in fish, and all manner of ware, and"
Nehemiah,13,17,Then I contended with the nobles
Nehemiah,13,18,"Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,19,"And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in"
Nehemiah,13,20,So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once

Nehemiah,13,22,"And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy. Intermarriage Forbidden (Ezra 9:1–4)"

Esther,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:) 2that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace, 3in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him: 4when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days. t"
Esther,1,5,"And when these days were fulfilled, he king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace;"
Esther,1,6,"There were hangings of white cloth, of green, and of blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and"
Esther,1,7,"And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being"
Esther,1,8,"And the drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure. Queen Vashti’s Refusal"
Esther,1,9,Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, 11to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal,"
Esther,1,12,"But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him. Queen Vashti Deposed"
Esther,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment; 14and the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king’s face, and"
Esther,1,15,"What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath"
Esther,1,16,"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the"
Esther,1,17,"For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him,"
Esther,1,18,"And this day shall the princesses of Persia and Media which have heard of the deed of the queen say the like unto all the king’s princes, So shall there arise much contempt and"
Esther,1,19,"If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before"
Esther,1,20,"And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small."
Esther,1,21,"And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan: 22for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should publish it according to the language of his people."
Esther,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what"
Esther,2,2,"Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king: 3and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that young virgins unto Shushan the palace, they may gather together all the fair to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them: 4and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king, and he did so. Esther Finds Favor"
Esther,2,5,"There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; 6who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar he king of Babylon"
Esther,2,7,"And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter."
Esther,2,8,"So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into"
Esther,2,9,"And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king’s house: and he removed"
Esther,2,10,Esther had not shewed her people
Esther,2,11,"And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her."
Esther,2,12,"Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women, twelve months, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with the things for the purifying of the women,) 13then in this wise came the maiden unto the king, whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s"
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name."
Esther,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them"
Esther,2,16,"So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. Esther Becomes Queen"
Esther,2,17,"And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of"
Esther,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king."
Esther,2,19,"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate."
Esther,2,20,"Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him. Mordecai Uncovers a Conspiracy"
Esther,2,21,"In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus."
Esther,2,22,"And the thing was known to Mordecai, who shewed it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the"
Esther,2,23,"And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king."
Esther,3,1,"After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and"
Esther,3,2,"And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman: for the king had so commanded"
Esther,3,3,"Then the king’s servants, that"
Esther,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told"
Esther,3,5,"And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of"
Esther,3,6,"But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai."
Esther,3,7,"In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, which"
Esther,3,8,"And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from those of every people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to suffer"
Esther,3,9,"If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the king’s business, to bring it into the king’s"
Esther,3,10,"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha"
Esther,3,11,"And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee."
Esther,3,12,"Then were the king’s scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof, and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people; to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it"
Esther,3,13,"And letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of"
Esther,3,14,"A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was"
Esther,3,15,"The posts went forth in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace: and the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed."
Esther,4,1,"Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry: 2and he came"
Esther,4,3,"And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,"And Esther’s maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him: but he"
Esther,4,5,"Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it"
Esther,4,6,"So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king’s"
Esther,4,7,"And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that"
Esther,4,8,"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her; and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people."
Esther,4,9,And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther,4,10,"Then Esther spake unto Hathach, and"
Esther,4,11,"All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto"
Esther,4,12,And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
Esther,4,13,"Then Mordecai bade them return answer unto Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape"
Esther,4,14,"For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father’s house shall perish: and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
Esther,4,15,"Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai,"
Esther,4,16,"Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the"
Esther,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."
Esther,5,1,"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the"

Esther,5,3,"Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee"
Esther,5,4,"And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him."
Esther,5,5,"Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king"
Esther,5,6,"And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall he granted thee: and what is thy request? even to"
Esther,5,7,"Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is; 8if I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king hath said. Haman’s Plot against Mordecai"
Esther,5,9,Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s
Esther,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife."
Esther,5,11,"And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and"
Esther,5,12,"Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow also am I invited by her"
Esther,5,13,"Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at"
Esther,5,14,"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made."
Esther,6,1,On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the
Esther,6,2,"And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, of those that kept the door, who had sought to"

Esther,6,4,"And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him."
Esther,6,5,"And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let"
Esther,6,6,"So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do"
Esther,6,7,"And Haman said unto the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, 8let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on the head of which a crown royal is set: 9and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour."
Esther,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast"
Esther,6,11,"Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour."
Esther,6,12,"And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having"
Esther,6,13,"And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him."
Esther,6,14,"While they were yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
Esther,7,2,"And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall he granted"
Esther,7,3,"Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request: 4for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had"
Esther,7,5,"Then spake the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst"
Esther,7,6,"And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. The Hanging of Haman"
Esther,7,7,And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil
Esther,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth,"
Esther,7,9,"Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spake good for"
Esther,7,10,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.
Esther,8,1,On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews enemy unto Esther the queen.
Esther,8,2,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
Esther,8,3,"And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews."
Esther,8,4,"Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king."
Esther,8,5,"And she said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king’s provinces: 6for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred? The Decree of Xerxes"
Esther,8,7,"Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"Write ye also to the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring: for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse."
Esther,8,9,"Then were the king’s scribes called at that time, in the third month, which is the month, Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and"
Esther,8,10,"And he wrote in the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king’s service, bred of the stud: 11wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey, 12upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth"
Esther,8,13,"A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready"
Esther,8,14,"So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the king’s service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace."
Esther,8,15,"And Mordecai went forth front the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan shouted and"
Esther,8,16,"The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honour."
Esther,8,17,"And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them."
Esther,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them; whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them; 2the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand"

Esther,9,11,On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
Esther,9,12,"And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and"
Esther,9,13,"Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged"
Esther,9,14,And the king commanded it so to be done: and a decree was given out in Shushan;
Esther,9,15,"And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand."
Esther,9,16,"And the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five"
Esther,9,17,"This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. The Feast of Purim Instituted"
Esther,9,18,"But the Jews that were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting"
Esther,9,19,"Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another."
Esther,9,20,"And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far, 21to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, 22as the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor."
Esther,9,23,"And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them; 24because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them; 25but when the matter came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head; and that he and his sons should he hanged"
Esther,9,26,"Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them, 27the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year; 28and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed."
Esther,9,29,"Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to"
Esther,9,30,"And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, 31to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, in the matter of the fastings and"
Esther,9,32,And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
Esther,10,1,"And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea."
Esther,10,2,"And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king"
Esther,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren; seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed."
Job,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and"
Job,1,2,And there were born unto him seven sons and three
Job,1,3,"His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was"
Job,1,4,And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each
Job,1,5,"And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burn offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. Satan’s First Attack"
Job,1,6,"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan"
Job,1,7,"And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered"
Job,1,8,"And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a"
Job,1,9,Then Satan answered the
Job,1,10,"Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his"
Job,1,11,"But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he"
Job,1,12,"And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD. Job Loses His Children and Possessions"
Job,1,13,"And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house, 14that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: 15and the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have"
Job,1,16,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
Job,1,17,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the"
Job,1,18,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: 19and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
Job,1,20,"Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped; 21and he said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."
Job,1,22,"In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God with foolishness."
Job,2,1,"Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan"
Job,2,2,"And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth,"
Job,2,3,"And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and art upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy"
Job,2,4,"And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath"
Job,2,5,"But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will"
Job,2,6,"And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; only spare his life."
Job,2,7,"So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of"
Job,2,8,And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat among the ashes.
Job,2,9,"Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die."
Job,2,10,"But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. Job’s Three Friends"
Job,2,11,"Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: and"
Job,2,12,"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every"
Job,2,13,"So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great."
Job,3,1,"After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day."
Job,3,2,And Job answered and said:
Job,3,3,"Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night which said, There is a man child conceived."
Job,3,4,"Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it."
Job,3,5,Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; let a cloud dwell upon it; let all that maketh black the day terrify it.
Job,3,6,"As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months."
Job,3,7,"Lo, let that night be barren; let no joyful voice come therein."
Job,3,8,"Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan."
Job,3,9,"Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: let it look for light, but have none; neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:"
Job,3,10,"Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor hid trouble from mine eyes."
Job,3,11,Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
Job,3,12,"Why did the knees receive me? or why the breasts, that I should suck?"
Job,3,13,For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest:
Job,3,14,"With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built up waste places for themselves;"
Job,3,15,"Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:"
Job,3,16,Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
Job,3,17,There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
Job,3,18,There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
Job,3,19,The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
Job,3,20,"Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;"
Job,3,21,"Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;"
Job,3,22,"Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?"
Job,3,23,"Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?"
Job,3,24,"For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like water."
Job,3,25,"For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, and that which I am afraid of cometh unto me."
Job,3,26,"I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; but trouble cometh."
Job,4,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,"
Job,4,2,"If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?"
Job,4,3,"Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands."
Job,4,4,"Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast confirmed the feeble knees."
Job,4,5,"But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled."
Job,4,6,"Is not thy fear of God thy confidence, and thy hope the integrity of thy ways?"
Job,4,7,"Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the upright cut off?"
Job,4,8,"According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow trouble, reap the same."
Job,4,9,"By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger are they consumed."
Job,4,10,"The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken."
Job,4,11,"The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad."
Job,4,12,"Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a whisper thereof."
Job,4,13,"In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,"
Job,4,14,"Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake."
Job,4,15,Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.
Job,4,16,"It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; a form was before mine eyes: there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,"
Job,4,17,Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
Job,4,18,"Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants; and his angels he chargeth with folly:"
Job,4,19,"How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth!"
Job,4,20,Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
Job,4,21,"Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? they die, and that without wisdom."
Job,5,1,Call now; is there any that will answer thee? and to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?
Job,5,2,"For vexation killeth the foolish man, and jealousy slayeth the silly one."
Job,5,3,I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
Job,5,4,"His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them."
Job,5,5,"Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the snare gapeth for their substance."
Job,5,6,"For affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;"
Job,5,7,"But man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward."
Job,5,8,"But as for me, I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:"
Job,5,9,Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number:
Job,5,10,"Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:"
Job,5,11,So that he setteth up on high those that be low; and those which mourn are exalted to safety.
Job,5,12,"He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise."
Job,5,13,He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
Job,5,14,"They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope at noonday as in the night."
Job,5,15,"But he saveth from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty."
Job,5,16,"So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth."
Job,5,17,"Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty."
Job,5,18,"For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; he woundeth, and his hands make whole."
Job,5,19,"He shall deliver thee in six troubles; yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee."
Job,5,20,In famine he shall redeem thee from death; and in war from the power of the sword.
Job,5,21,Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
Job,5,22,At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh; neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
Job,5,23,For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
Job,5,24,"And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; and thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing."
Job,5,25,"Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth."
Job,5,26,"Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in its season."
Job,5,27,"Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good."
Job,6,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,6,2,"Oh that my vexation were but weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!"
Job,6,3,For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: therefore have my words been rash.
Job,6,4,"For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me."
Job,6,5,Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
Job,6,6,Can that which hath no savour be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
Job,6,7,My soul refuseth to touch them; they are as loathsome meat to me.
Job,6,8,Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for.
Job,6,9,"Even that it would please God to crush me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!"
Job,6,10,"Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would exult in pain that spareth not: for I have not denied the words of the Holy One."
Job,6,11,"What is my strength, that I should wait? and what is mine end, at I should be patient?"
Job,6,12,Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
Job,6,13,"Is it not that I have no help in me, and that effectual working is driven quite from me?"
Job,6,14,To him that is ready to faint kindness should be shewed from his friend; even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
Job,6,15,"My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away;"
Job,6,16,"Which are black by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow hideth itself:"
Job,6,17,"What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place."
Job,6,18,"The caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside; they go up into the waste, and perish."
Job,6,19,"The caravans of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them."
Job,6,20,"They were ashamed because they had hoped; they came thither, and were confounded."
Job,6,21,"For now ye are nothing; ye see a terror, and are afraid."
Job,6,22,"Did I say, Give unto me? or, offer a present for me of your substance?"
Job,6,23,"Or, Deliver me from the adversary’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?"
Job,6,24,"Teach me, and I will hold my peace: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred."
Job,6,25,How forcible are words of uprightness! but what doth your arguing reprove?
Job,6,26,Do ye imagine to reprove words? seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind.
Job,6,27,"Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend."
Job,6,28,Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; for surely I shall not lie to your face.
Job,6,29,"Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; yea, return again, my cause is righteous."
Job,6,30,Is there injustice on my tongue? cannot my taste discern mischievous things?
Job,7,1,Is there not a warfare to man upon earth? and are not his days like the days of an hireling?
Job,7,2,"As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling that looketh for his wages:"
Job,7,3,"So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me."
Job,7,4,"When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise? but the night is long; and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day."
Job,7,5,My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin closeth up and breaketh out afresh.
Job,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope."
Job,7,7,Oh remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
Job,7,8,"The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more: thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be."
Job,7,9,"As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more."
Job,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more."
Job,7,11,Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,7,12,"Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, that thou settest a watch over me?"
Job,7,13,"When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;"
Job,7,14,"Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:"
Job,7,15,"So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than these my bones."
Job,7,16,I loathe my life; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.
Job,7,17,"What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him, and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him,"
Job,7,18,"And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?"
Job,7,19,"How long wilt thou not look away from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?"
Job,7,20,"If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of men? why hast thou set me as a mark for thee, so that I am a burden to myself?"
Job,7,21,"And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I lie down in the dust; and thou shall seek me diligently, but I shall not be."
Job,8,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
Job,8,2,How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a mighty wind?
Job,8,3,Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
Job,8,4,"If thy children have sinned against him, and he have delivered them into the hand of their transgression:"
Job,8,5,"If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;"
Job,8,6,"If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous."
Job,8,7,"And though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase."
Job,8,8,"For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out: 9(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)"
Job,8,10,"Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?"
Job,8,11,Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
Job,8,12,"Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb."
Job,8,13,So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hope of the godless man shall perish:
Job,8,14,"Whose confidence shall break in sunder, and whose trust is a spider’s web."
Job,8,15,"He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure."
Job,8,16,"He is green before the sun, and his shoots go forth over his garden."
Job,8,17,"His roots are wrapped about the heap, he beholdeth the place of stones."
Job,8,18,"If he be destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee."
Job,8,19,"Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others spring."
Job,8,20,"Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he uphold the evil-doers."
Job,8,21,"He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, and thy lips with shouting."
Job,8,22,They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the tent of the wicked shall be no more.
Job,9,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,9,2,Of a truth I know that it is so: but how can man be just with God?
Job,9,3,"If he be pleased to contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand."
Job,9,4,"He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?"
Job,9,5,"Which removeth the mountains, and they know it not, when he overturneth them in his anger."
Job,9,6,"Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble."
Job,9,7,"Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars."
Job,9,8,"Which alone stretcheth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea."
Job,9,9,"Which maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south."
Job,9,10,"Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, marvelous things without number."
Job,9,11,"Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not."
Job,9,12,"Behold, he seizeth the prey, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?"
Job,9,13,God will not withdraw his anger; the helpers of Rahab do stoop under him.
Job,9,14,"How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?"
Job,9,15,"Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to mine adversary."
Job,9,16,"If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice."
Job,9,17,"For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause."
Job,9,18,"He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness."
Job,9,19,"If we speak of the strength of the mighty, lo, he is there! and if of judgment, who will appoint me a time?"
Job,9,20,"Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me: though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse."
Job,9,21,I am perfect; I regard not myself; I despise my life.
Job,9,22,"It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked."
Job,9,23,"If the scourge slay suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the innocent."
Job,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if it be not he, who then is it?"
Job,9,25,"Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good."
Job,9,26,They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that swoopeth on the prey.
Job,9,27,"If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer:"
Job,9,28,"I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent."
Job,9,29,I shall be condemned; why then do I labour in vain?
Job,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;"
Job,9,31,"Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me."
Job,9,32,"For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment."
Job,9,33,"There is no daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both."
Job,9,34,"Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his terror make me afraid:"
Job,9,35,"Then would I speak, and not fear him; for I am not so in myself."
Job,10,1,My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,10,2,"I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me."
Job,10,3,"Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,"Hast thou eyes of flesh, or seest thou as man seeth?"
Job,10,5,"Are thy days as the days of man, or thy years as man’s days,"
Job,10,6,"That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin,"
Job,10,7,Although thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand?
Job,10,8,Thine hands have framed me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
Job,10,9,"Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?"
Job,10,10,"Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?"
Job,10,11,"Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews."
Job,10,12,"Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit."
Job,10,13,Yet these things thou didst hide in thine heart; I know that this is with thee:
Job,10,14,"If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity."
Job,10,15,"If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head; being filled with ignominy and looking upon mine affliction."
Job,10,16,"And if my head exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvelous upon me."
Job,10,17,"Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and warfare are with me."
Job,10,18,"Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me."
Job,10,19,I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job,10,20,"Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,"
Job,10,21,"Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;"
Job,10,22,"A land of thick darkness, as darkness itself; a land of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness."
Job,11,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
Job,11,2,Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
Job,11,3,"Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?"
Job,11,4,"For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes."
Job,11,5,"But Oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;"
Job,11,6,"And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that iris manifold in effectual working! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth."
Job,11,7,Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
Job,11,8,It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?
Job,11,9,"The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea."
Job,11,10,"If he pass through, and shut up, and call unto judgment, then who can hinder him?"
Job,11,11,"For he knoweth vain men: he seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not."
Job,11,12,"But vain man is void of understanding, yea, man is born as a wild ass’s colt."
Job,11,13,"If thou set thine heart aright, and stretch out thine hands toward him;"
Job,11,14,"If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents;"
Job,11,15,"Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:"
Job,11,16,For thou shalt forget thy misery; thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away:
Job,11,17,"And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday; though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning."
Job,11,18,"And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt search about thee, and shalt take thy rest in safety."
Job,11,19,"Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee."
Job,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall have no way to flee, and their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost."
Job,12,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,12,2,"No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you."
Job,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?"
Job,12,4,"I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbour, a man that called upon God, and he answered him: the just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock."
Job,12,5,In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; it is ready for them whose foot slippeth.
Job,12,6,"The tents of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly."
Job,12,7,"But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:"
Job,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee."
Job,12,9,"Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of LORD hath wrought this?"
Job,12,10,"In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind."
Job,12,11,"Doth not the ear try words, even as the palate tasteth its meat?"
Job,12,12,"With aged men is wisdom, and in length of days understanding."
Job,12,13,With him is wisdom and might; he hath counsel and understanding.
Job,12,14,"Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening."
Job,12,15,"Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth."
Job,12,16,With him is strength and effectual working; the deceived and the deceiver are his.
Job,12,17,"He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and judges maketh he fools."
Job,12,18,"He looseth the bond of kings, and bindeth their loins with a girdle."
Job,12,19,"He leadeth priests away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty."
Job,12,20,"He removeth the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the elders."
Job,12,21,"He poureth contempt upon princes, and looseth the belt of the strong."
Job,12,22,"He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death."
Job,12,23,"He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he spreadeth the nations abroad, and bringeth them in."
Job,12,24,"He taketh away the heart of the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way."
Job,12,25,"They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man."
Job,13,1,"Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it."
Job,13,2,"What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you."
Job,13,3,"Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God."
Job,13,4,"But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value."
Job,13,5,Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
Job,13,6,"Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips."
Job,13,7,"Will ye speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him?"
Job,13,8,Will ye respect his person? will ye contend for God?
Job,13,9,"Is it good that he should search you out? or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?"
Job,13,10,"He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly respect persons."
Job,13,11,"Shall not his excellency make you afraid, and his dread fall upon you?"
Job,13,12,"Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, your defences are defences of clay."
Job,13,13,"Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what wilt."
Job,13,14,"Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?"
Job,13,15,"Though he slay me, yet will I wait for him: nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him."
Job,13,16,This also shall be my salvation; for a godless man shall not come before him.
Job,13,17,"Hear diligently my speech, and let my declaration be in your ears."
Job,13,18,"Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I am righteous."
Job,13,19,Who is he that will contend with me? for now shall I hold my peace and give up the ghost.
Job,13,20,"Only do not two things unto me, then will I not hide myself from thy face:"
Job,13,21,Withdraw thine hand far from me; and let not thy terror make me afraid.
Job,13,22,"Then call thou, and I will answer; or let me speak, and answer thou me."
Job,13,23,How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
Job,13,24,"Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?"
Job,13,25,Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
Job,13,26,"For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:"
Job,13,27,"Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and markest all my paths; thou drawest thee a line about the soles of my feet:"
Job,13,28,"Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth, like a garment that is moth-eaten."
Job,14,1,"Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble."
Job,14,2,"He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not."
Job,14,3,"And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?"
Job,14,4,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
Job,14,5,"Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with thee, and thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;"
Job,14,6,"Look away from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day."
Job,14,7,"For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease."
Job,14,8,"Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;"
Job,14,9,"Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and put forth boughs like a plant."
Job,14,10,"But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?"
Job,14,11,"As the waters fail from the sea, and the river decayeth and drieth up;"
Job,14,12,"So man lieth down and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be roused out of their sleep."
Job,14,13,"Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
Job,14,14,"If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my warfare would I wait, till my release should come."
Job,14,15,"Thou shouldest call, and I would answer thee: thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thine hands."
Job,14,16,But now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?
Job,14,17,"My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou fastenest up mine iniquity."
Job,14,18,"And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of its place;"
Job,14,19,The waters wear the stones; the overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth: and thou destroyest the hope of man.
Job,14,20,"Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth; thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away."
Job,14,21,"His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them."
Job,14,22,"But his flesh upon him hath pain, and his soul within him mourneth."
Job,15,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,"
Job,15,2,"Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?"
Job,15,3,"Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?"
Job,15,4,"Yea, thou doest away with fear, and restrainest devotion before God."
Job,15,5,"For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty."
Job,15,6,"Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; yea, thine own lips testify against thee."
Job,15,7,Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou brought forth before the hills?
Job,15,8,Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
Job,15,9,"What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?"
Job,15,10,"With us are both the grayheaded and the very aged men, much elder than thy father."
Job,15,11,"Are the consolations of God too small for thee, and the word that dealeth gently with thee?"
Job,15,12,Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and why do thine eyes wink?
Job,15,13,"That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth."
Job,15,14,"What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
Job,15,15,"Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight."
Job,15,16,"How much less one that is abominable and corrupt, a man that drinketh iniquity like water!"
Job,15,17,"I will shew thee, hear thou me; and that which I have seen I will declare: 18(Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it;"
Job,15,19,"Unto whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them:)"
Job,15,20,"The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor."
Job,15,21,A sound of terrors is in his ears; in prosperity the spoiler shall come upon him:
Job,15,22,"He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword:"
Job,15,23,"He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand:"
Job,15,24,"Distress and anguish make him afraid; they prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle:"
Job,15,25,"Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, and behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;"
Job,15,26,"He runneth upon him with a stiff neck, with the thick bosses of his bucklers:"
Job,15,27,"Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, and made collops of fat on his flanks;"
Job,15,28,"And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, in houses which no man inhabited, which were ready to become heaps."
Job,15,29,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall their produce bend to the earth."
Job,15,30,"He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away."
Job,15,31,"Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself: for vanity shall be his recompence."
Job,15,32,"It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green."
Job,15,33,"He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive."
Job,15,34,"For the company of the godless shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery."
Job,15,35,"They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, and their belly prepareth deceit."
Job,16,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,16,2,I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
Job,16,3,Shall vain words have an end? or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?
Job,16,4,"I also could speak as ye do; if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could join words together against you, and shake mine head at you."
Job,16,5,"But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips should assuage your grief."
Job,16,6,"Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?"
Job,16,7,But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
Job,16,8,"And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me: and my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face."
Job,16,9,"He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; he hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me."
Job,16,10,They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: they gather themselves together against me.
Job,16,11,"God delivereth me to the ungodly, and casteth me into the hands of the wicked."
Job,16,12,"I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: he hath also set me up for his mark."
Job,16,13,"His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground."
Job,16,14,He breaketh me with breach upon breach; he runneth upon me like a giant.
Job,16,15,"I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have laid my horn in the dust."
Job,16,16,"My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;"
Job,16,17,"Although there is no violence in mine hands, and my prayer is pure."
Job,16,18,"O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no resting place."
Job,16,19,"Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he that coucheth for me is on high."
Job,16,20,My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God;
Job,16,21,"That he would maintain the right of a man with God, and of a son of man with his neighbour!"
Job,16,22,"For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return."
Job,17,1,"My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, the grave is ready for me."
Job,17,2,"Surely there are mockers with me, and mine eye abideth in their provocation."
Job,17,3,"Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; who is there that will strike hands with me?"
Job,17,4,For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
Job,17,5,"He that denounceth his friends for a prey, even the eyes of his children shall fail."
Job,17,6,He hath made me also a byword of the people; and I am become an open abhorring.
Job,17,7,"Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow."
Job,17,8,"Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless."
Job,17,9,"Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger."
Job,17,10,"But return ye, all of you, and come now: and I shall not find a wise man among you."
Job,17,11,"My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the droughts of my heart."
Job,17,12,"They change the night into a day: the fight, say they, is near unto the darkness."
Job,17,13,If I look for Sheol as mine house; if I have spread my couch in the darkness;
Job,17,14,"If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister;"
Job,17,15,"Where then is my hope? and as for my hope, who shall see it?"
Job,17,16,"It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, when once there is rest in the dust."
Job,18,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
Job,18,2,"How long will ye lay snares for words? consider, and afterwards we will speak."
Job,18,3,"Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and are become unclean in your sight?"
Job,18,4,"Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, shall the earth be forsaken for thee? or shall the rock be removed out of its place?"
Job,18,5,"Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine."
Job,18,6,"The light shall be dark in his tent, and his lamp above him shall be put out."
Job,18,7,"The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down."
Job,18,8,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon the toils."
Job,18,9,"A gin shall take him by the heel, and a snare shall lay hold on him."
Job,18,10,"A noose is hid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way."
Job,18,11,"Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall chase him at his heels."
Job,18,12,His strength shall be hunger-bitten and calamity shall be ready for his halting.
Job,18,13,"It shall devour the members of his body, yea, the firstborn of death shall devour his members."
Job,18,14,He shall be rooted out of his tent wherein he trusteth; and he shall be brought to the king of terrors.
Job,18,15,There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
Job,18,16,"His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off."
Job,18,17,"His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street."
Job,18,18,"He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world."
Job,18,19,"He shall have neither son nor son’s son among his people, nor any remaining where he sojourned."
Job,18,20,"They that come after shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted."
Job,18,21,"Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God."
Job,19,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,19,2,How long will ye vex my soul and break me in pieces with words?
Job,19,3,These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.
Job,19,4,"And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself."
Job,19,5,"If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:"
Job,19,6,"Know now that God hath subverted me in my cause, and hath compassed me with his net."
Job,19,7,"Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry for help, but there is no judgment."
Job,19,8,"He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and hath set darkness in my paths."
Job,19,9,"He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head."
Job,19,10,"He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he plucked up like a tree."
Job,19,11,"He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his adversaries."
Job,19,12,"His troops come on together, and cast up their way against me, and encamp round about my tent."
Job,19,13,"He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me."
Job,19,14,"My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me."
Job,19,15,"They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight."
Job,19,16,"I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer, though I entreat him with my mouth."
Job,19,17,"My breath is strange to my wife, and my supplication to the children of my mother’s womb."
Job,19,18,"Even young children despise me; if I arise, they speak against me."
Job,19,19,All my inward friends abhor me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
Job,19,20,"My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth."
Job,19,21,"Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me."
Job,19,22,"Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?"
Job,19,23,Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were inscribed in a book!
Job,19,24,That with an iron pen and lead they were graven in the rock for ever!
Job,19,25,"But I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand up at the last upon the earth:"
Job,19,26,"And after my skin hath been thus destroyed, yet from my flesh shall I see God:"
Job,19,27,"Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. My reins are consumed within me."
Job,19,28,"If ye say, How we will persecute him! seeing that the root of the matter is found in me;"
Job,19,29,"Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment."
Job,20,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
Job,20,2,"Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, even by reason of my haste that is in me."
Job,20,3,"I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame, and the spirit of my understanding answereth me."
Job,20,4,"Knowest thou not this of old time, since man was placed upon earth,"
Job,20,5,"That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment?"
Job,20,6,"Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;"
Job,20,7,"Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?"
Job,20,8,"He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night."
Job,20,9,The eye which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
Job,20,10,"His children shall seek the favour of the poor, and his hands shall give back his wealth."
Job,20,11,"His bones are full of his youth, but it shall lie down with him in the dust."
Job,20,12,"Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;"
Job,20,13,"Though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth;"
Job,20,14,"Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him."
Job,20,15,"He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly."
Job,20,16,He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.
Job,20,17,"He shall not look upon the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter."
Job,20,18,"That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down; according to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice."
Job,20,19,"For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; he hath violently taken away an house, and he shall not build it up."
Job,20,20,"Because he knew no quietness within him, he shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth."
Job,20,21,There was nothing left that he devoured not; therefore his prosperity shall not endure.
Job,20,22,In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: the hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.
Job,20,23,"When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating."
Job,20,24,"He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of brass shall strike him through."
Job,20,25,"He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body: yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall; terrors are upon him."
Job,20,26,All darkness is laid up for his treasures: a fire not blown by man shall devour him; it shall consume that which is left in his tent.
Job,20,27,"The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him."
Job,20,28,"The increase of his house shall depart, his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath."
Job,20,29,"This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God."
Job,21,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,21,2,Hear diligently my speech; and let this be your consolations.
Job,21,3,"Suffer me, and I also will speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on."
Job,21,4,"As for me, is my complaint to man? and why should I not be impatient?"
Job,21,5,"Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth."
Job,21,6,"Even when I remember I am troubled, and horror taketh hold on my flesh."
Job,21,7,"Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, wax mighty in power?"
Job,21,8,"Their seed is established with them in their sight, and their offspring before their eyes."
Job,21,9,"Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them."
Job,21,10,"Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf."
Job,21,11,"They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance."
Job,21,12,"They sing to the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe."
Job,21,13,"They spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment they go down to Sheol."
Job,21,14,"Yet they said unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways."
Job,21,15,"What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?"
Job,21,16,"Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
Job,21,17,How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? that their calamity cometh upon them? that God distributeth sorrows in his anger?
Job,21,18,"That they are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away?"
Job,21,19,"Ye say, God layeth up his iniquity for his children. Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it."
Job,21,20,"Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
Job,21,21,"For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?"
Job,21,22,Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
Job,21,23,"One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet:"
Job,21,24,"His breasts are full of milk, and the marrow of his bones is moistened."
Job,21,25,"And another dieth in bitterness of soul, and never tasteth of good."
Job,21,26,"They lie down alike in the dust, and the worm covereth them."
Job,21,27,"Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me."
Job,21,28,"For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?"
Job,21,29,Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens?
Job,21,30,That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? that they are led forth to the day of wrath?
Job,21,31,Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
Job,21,32,"Yet shall he be borne to the grave, and shall keep watch over the tomb."
Job,21,33,"The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and all men shall draw after him, as there were innumerable before him."
Job,21,34,"How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth only falsehood?"
Job,22,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,"
Job,22,2,Can a man be profitable unto God? surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.
Job,22,3,"Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?"
Job,22,4,"Is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee, that he entereth with thee into judgment?"
Job,22,5,Is not thy wickedness great? neither is there any end to thine iniquities.
Job,22,6,"For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing."
Job,22,7,"Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry."
Job,22,8,"But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man, he dwelt in it."
Job,22,9,"Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken."
Job,22,10,"Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee,"
Job,22,11,"Or darkness, that thou canst not see, and abundance of waters cover thee."
Job,22,12,"Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!"
Job,22,13,"And thou sayest, What doth God know? can he judge through the thick darkness?"
Job,22,14,"Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven."
Job,22,15,Wilt thou keep the old way which wicked men have trodden?
Job,22,16,"Who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream:"
Job,22,17,"Who said unto God, Depart from us; and, What can the Almighty do for us?"
Job,22,18,Yet he fired their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job,22,19,"The righteous see it, and are glad; and the innocent laugh them to scorn:"
Job,22,20,"Saying, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off, and the remnant of them the fire hath consumed."
Job,22,21,"Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee."
Job,22,22,"Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart."
Job,22,23,"If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up; if thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents."
Job,22,24,"And lay thou thy treasure in the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks;"
Job,22,25,"And the Almighty shall be thy treasure, and precious silver unto thee."
Job,22,26,"For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God."
Job,22,27,"Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee; and thou shalt pay thy vows."
Job,22,28,"Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; and light shall shine upon thy ways."
Job,22,29,"When they cast thee down, thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and the humble person he shall save."
Job,22,30,"He shall deliver even him that is not innocent: yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thine hands."
Job,23,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,23,2,Even today is my complaint rebellious: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
Job,23,3,"Oh that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat!"
Job,23,4,"I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments."
Job,23,5,"I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me."
Job,23,6,Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.
Job,23,7,There the upright might reason with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
Job,23,8,"Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:"
Job,23,9,"On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him."
Job,23,10,"But he knoweth the way that I take; when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold."
Job,23,11,"My foot hath held fast to his steps; his way have I kept, and turned not aside."
Job,23,12,I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
Job,23,13,"But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth."
Job,23,14,For he performeth that which is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.
Job,23,15,"Therefore am I troubled at his presence; when I consider, I am afraid of him."
Job,23,16,"For God hath made my heart faint, and the Almighty hath troubled me:"
Job,23,17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face."
Job,24,1,Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? and why do not they which know him see his days?
Job,24,2,"There are that remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed them."
Job,24,3,"They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge."
Job,24,4,They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
Job,24,5,"Behold, as wild asses in the desert they go forth to their work, seeking diligently for meat; the wilderness yieldeth them food for their children."
Job,24,6,They cut their provender in the field; and they glean the vintage of the wicked.
Job,24,7,"They lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering in the cold."
Job,24,8,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter."
Job,24,9,"There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor:"
Job,24,10,"So that they go about naked without clothing, and being an-hungred they carry the sheaves;"
Job,24,11,"They make oil within the walls of these men; they tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst."
Job,24,12,"From out of the populous city men groan, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God imputeth it not for folly."
Job,24,13,"These are of them that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof."
Job,24,14,"The murderer riseth with the light, he killeth the poor and needy; and in the night he is as a thief."
Job,24,15,"The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and he disguiseth his face."
Job,24,16,In the dark they dig through houses: they shut themselves up in the daytime; they know not the light.
Job,24,17,For the morning is to all of them as the shadow of death; for they know the terrors of the shadow of death.
Job,24,18,He is swift upon the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he turneth not by the way of the vineyards.
Job,24,19,Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth Sheol those which have sinned.
Job,24,20,The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered: and unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.
Job,24,21,He devoureth the barren that beareth not; and doeth not good to the widow.
Job,24,22,"He draweth away the mighty also by his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life."
Job,24,23,"God giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon; and his eyes are upon their ways."
Job,24,24,"They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone; yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all other, and are cut off as the tops of the ears of corn."
Job,24,25,"And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?"
Job,25,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
Job,25,2,Dominion and fear are with him; he maketh peace in his high places.
Job,25,3,Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
Job,25,4,How then can man be just with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
Job,25,5,"Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, and the stars are not pure in his sight:"
Job,25,6,"How much less man, that is a worm! and the son of man, which is a worm!"
Job,26,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
Job,26,2,How hast thou helped him that is without power! how hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!
Job,26,3,"How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge!"
Job,26,4,To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came forth from thee?
Job,26,5,They that are deceased tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.
Job,26,6,"Sheol is naked before him, and Abaddon hath no covering."
Job,26,7,"He stretcheth out the north over empty space, and hangeth the earth upon nothing."
Job,26,8,He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
Job,26,9,"He closeth in the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it."
Job,26,10,"He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, unto the confines of light and darkness."
Job,26,11,The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke.
Job,26,12,"He stirreth up the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab."
Job,26,13,By his spirit the heavens are garnished; his hand hath pierced the swift serpent.
Job,26,14,"Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways: and how small a whisper do we hear of him! but the thunder of his power who can understand?"
Job,27,1,"And Job again took up his parable, and said,"
Job,27,2,"As God liveth, who hath taken away my right; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul; 3(For my life is yet whole in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;)"
Job,27,4,"Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, neither shall my tongue utter deceit."
Job,27,5,God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.
Job,27,6,"My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. The Wicked Man’s Portion"
Job,27,7,"Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous."
Job,27,8,"For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain, when God taketh away his soul?"
Job,27,9,"Will God hear his cry, when trouble cometh upon him?"
Job,27,10,"Will he delight himself in the Almighty, and call upon God at all times?"
Job,27,11,I will teach you concerning the hand of God; that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
Job,27,12,"Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye become altogether vain?"
Job,27,13,"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty."
Job,27,14,"If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread."
Job,27,15,"Those that remain of him shall be buried in death, and his widows shall make no lamentation."
Job,27,16,"Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;"
Job,27,17,"He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver."
Job,27,18,"He buildeth his house as the moth, and as a booth which the keeper maketh."
Job,27,19,"He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered; he openeth his eyes, and he is not."
Job,27,20,Terrors overtake him like waters; a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
Job,27,21,"The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth; and it sweepeth him out of his place."
Job,27,22,"For God shall hurl at him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand."
Job,27,23,"Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place."
Job,28,1,"Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold which they refine."
Job,28,2,"Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone."
Job,28,3,"Man setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out to the furthest bound the stones of thick darkness and of the shadow of death."
Job,28,4,"He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; they are forgotten of the foot that passeth by; they hang afar from men, they swing to and fro."
Job,28,5,"As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and underneath it is turned up as it were by fire."
Job,28,6,"The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, and it hath dust of gold."
Job,28,7,"That path no bird of prey knoweth, neither hath the falcon’s eye seen it:"
Job,28,8,"The proud beasts have not trodden it, nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby."
Job,28,9,He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
Job,28,10,He cutteth out channels among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
Job,28,11,He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
Job,28,12,But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,13,Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
Job,28,14,"The deep saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me."
Job,28,15,"It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof."
Job,28,16,"It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire."
Job,28,17,Gold and glass cannot equal it: neither shall the exchange thereof be jewels of fine gold.
Job,28,18,"No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal: yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies."
Job,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold."
Job,28,20,Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,21,"Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air."
Job,28,22,"Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumour thereof with our ears."
Job,28,23,"God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof."
Job,28,24,"For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;"
Job,28,25,"To make a weight for the wind; yea, he meteth out the waters by measure."
Job,28,26,"When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:"
Job,28,27,"Then did he see it, and declare it; he established it, yea, and searched it out."
Job,28,28,"And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding."
Job,29,1,"And Job again took up his parable, and said,"
Job,29,2,"Oh that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me;"
Job,29,3,"When his lamp shined upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkness;"
Job,29,4,"As I was in the ripeness of my days, when the secret of God was upon my tent;"
Job,29,5,"When the Almighty was yet with me, and my children were about me;"
Job,29,6,"When my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil!"
Job,29,7,"When I went forth to the gate unto the city, when I prepared my seat in the street,"
Job,29,8,"The young men saw me and hid themselves, and the aged rose up and stood;"
Job,29,9,"The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth;"
Job,29,10,"The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth."
Job,29,11,"For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me:"
Job,29,12,"Because I delivered the poor that cried, the fatherless also, that had none to help him."
Job,29,13,The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
Job,29,14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my justice was as a robe and a diadem."
Job,29,15,"I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame."
Job,29,16,I was a father to the needy: and the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.
Job,29,17,"And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous, and plucked the prey out of his teeth."
Job,29,18,"Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand:"
Job,29,19,"My root is spread out to the waters, and the dew lieth all night upon my branch:"
Job,29,20,"My glory is fresh in me, and my bow is renewed in my hand."
Job,29,21,"Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence for my counsel."
Job,29,22,After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
Job,29,23,And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
Job,29,24,"If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down."
Job,29,25,"I chose out their way, and sat as chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners."
Job,30,1,"But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock."
Job,30,2,"Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? men in whom ripe age is perished."
Job,30,3,They are gaunt with want and famine; they gnaw the dry ground; in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.
Job,30,4,They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; and the roots of the broom are their meat.
Job,30,5,They are driven forth from the midst of men; they cry after them as after a thief.
Job,30,6,"In the clefts of the valleys must they dwell, in holes of the earth and of the rocks."
Job,30,7,Among the bushes they bray; under the nettles they are gathered together.
Job,30,8,"They are children of fools, yea, children of base men; they were scourged out of the land."
Job,30,9,"And now I am become their song, yea, I am a byword unto them."
Job,30,10,"They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and spare not to spit in my face."
Job,30,11,"For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me, and they have cast off the bridle before me."
Job,30,12,"Upon my right hand rise the rabble; they thrust aside my feet, and they cast up against me their ways of destruction."
Job,30,13,"They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, even men that have no helper."
Job,30,14,As through a wide breach they come: in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me. Job’s Prosperity Becomes Calamity
Job,30,15,"Terrors are turned upon me, they chase mine honour as the wind; and my welfare is passed away as a cloud."
Job,30,16,And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
Job,30,17,"In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest."
Job,30,18,By the great force of my disease is my garment disfigured: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
Job,30,19,"He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes."
Job,30,20,"I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me: I stand up, and thou lookest at me."
Job,30,21,Thou art turned to be cruel to me: with the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.
Job,30,22,"Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride upon it; and thou dissolvest me in the storm."
Job,30,23,"For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living."
Job,30,24,"Surely against a ruinous heap he will not put forth his hand; though it be in his destruction, one may utter a cry because of these things."
Job,30,25,Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the needy?
Job,30,26,"When I looked for good, then evil came; and when I waited for light, there came darkness."
Job,30,27,"My bowels boil, and rest not; days of affliction are come upon me."
Job,30,28,"I go mourning without the sun: I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help."
Job,30,29,"I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches."
Job,30,30,"My skin is black, and falleth from me, and my bones are burned with heat."
Job,30,31,"Therefore is my harp turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of them that weep."
Job,31,1,I MADE a covenant with mine eyes; how then should I look upon a maid?
Job,31,2,"For what is the portion of God from above, and the heritage of the Almighty from on high?"
Job,31,3,"Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity?"
Job,31,4,"Doth not he see my ways, and number all my steps?"
Job,31,5,"If I have walked with vanity, and my foot hath hasted to deceit; 6(Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity;)"
Job,31,7,"If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any spot hath cleaved to mine hands:"
Job,31,8,"Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out."
Job,31,9,"If mine heart have been enticed unto a woman, and I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door:"
Job,31,10,"Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her."
Job,31,11,"For that were an heinous crime; yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:"
Job,31,12,"For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction, and would root out all mine increase."
Job,31,13,"If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me:"
Job,31,14,"What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?"
Job,31,15,Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
Job,31,16,"If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;"
Job,31,17,"Or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; 18(Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, and I have been her guide from my mother’s womb;)"
Job,31,19,"If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering;"
Job,31,20,"If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;"
Job,31,21,"If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate:"
Job,31,22,"Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone."
Job,31,23,"For calamity from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his excellency I could do nothing."
Job,31,24,"If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;"
Job,31,25,"If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;"
Job,31,26,"If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;"
Job,31,27,"And my heart hath been secretly enticed, and my mouth hath kissed my hand:"
Job,31,28,This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges: for I should have lied to God that is above.
Job,31,29,"If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him; 30(Yea, I suffered not my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse;)"
Job,31,31,"If the men of my tent said not, Who can find one that hath not been satisfied with his flesh?"
Job,31,32,The stranger did not lodge in the street; but I opened my doors to the traveller;
Job,31,33,"If like Adam I covered my transgressions, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom;"
Job,31,34,"Because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and went not out of the door—"
Job,31,35,"Oh that I had one to hear me! (lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me;) and that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written!"
Job,31,36,Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown.
Job,31,37,I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
Job,31,38,"If my land cry out against me, and the furrows thereof weep together;"
Job,31,39,"If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:"
Job,31,40,"Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended."
Job,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his"
Job,32,3,Also against his three friends was his
Job,32,4,Now Elihu had waited
Job,32,5,"And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled."
Job,32,6,"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I held back, and durst not shew you mine opinion."
Job,32,7,"I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom."
Job,32,8,"But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding."
Job,32,9,"It is not the great that are wise, nor the aged that understand judgment."
Job,32,10,"Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion."
Job,32,11,"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say."
Job,32,12,"Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none that convinced Job, or that answered his words, among you."
Job,32,13,"Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man:"
Job,32,14,For he hath not directed his words against me; neither will I answer him with your speeches.
Job,32,15,"They are amazed, they answer no more: they have not a word to say."
Job,32,16,"And shall I wait, because they speak not, because they stand still, and answer no more?"
Job,32,17,"I also will answer my part, I also will shew mine opinion."
Job,32,18,For I am full of words; the spirit within me constraineth me.
Job,32,19,"Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; like new bottles it is ready to burst."
Job,32,20,"I will speak, that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer."
Job,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, respect any man’s person; neither will I give flattering titles unto any man."
Job,32,22,For I know not to give flattering titles; else would my Maker soon take me away.
Job,33,1,"Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, and hearken to all my words."
Job,33,2,"Behold now, I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth."
Job,33,3,My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart: and that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.
Job,33,4,"The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty giveth me life."
Job,33,5,"If thou canst, answer thou me; set thy words in order before me, stand forth."
Job,33,6,"Behold, I am toward God even as thou art: I also am formed out of the clay."
Job,33,7,"Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee."
Job,33,8,"Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,"
Job,33,9,"I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:"
Job,33,10,"Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy;"
Job,33,11,"He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths."
Job,33,12,"Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just; for God is greater than man."
Job,33,13,Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
Job,33,14,"For God speaketh once, yea twice, though man regardeth it not."
Job,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;"
Job,33,16,"Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,"
Job,33,17,"That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man;"
Job,33,18,"He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword."
Job,33,19,"He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and with continual strife in his bones:"
Job,33,20,"So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat."
Job,33,21,"His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out."
Job,33,22,"Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, and his life to the destroyers."
Job,33,23,"If there be with him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man what is right for him;"
Job,33,24,"Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom."
Job,33,25,His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s; he returneth to the days of his youth:
Job,33,26,"He prayeth unto God, and he is favourable unto him; so that he seeth his face with joy: and he restoreth unto man his righteousness."
Job,33,27,"He singeth before men, and saith, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not:"
Job,33,28,"He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit, and my life shall behold the light."
Job,33,29,"Lo, all these things doth God work, twice, yea thrice, with a man,"
Job,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living."
Job,33,31,"Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak."
Job,33,32,"If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee."
Job,33,33,"If not, hearken thou unto me: hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom."
Job,34,1,"Moreover Elihu answered and said,"
Job,34,2,"Hear my words, ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge."
Job,34,3,"For the ear trieth words, as the palate tasteth meat."
Job,34,4,Let us choose for us that which is right: let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job,34,5,"For Job hath said, I am righteous, and God hath taken away my right:"
Job,34,6,"Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression."
Job,34,7,"What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?"
Job,34,8,"Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men."
Job,34,9,"For he hath said, it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God."
Job,34,10,"Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity."
Job,34,11,"For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways."
Job,34,12,"Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment."
Job,34,13,Who gave him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
Job,34,14,"If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;"
Job,34,15,"All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust."
Job,34,16,"If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words."
Job,34,17,Shall even one that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is just and mighty?
Job,34,18,"Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art vile? or to nobles, Ye are wicked?"
Job,34,19,"How much less to him that respecteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands."
Job,34,20,"In a moment they die, even at midnight; the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away without hand."
Job,34,21,"For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, and he seeth all his goings."
Job,34,22,"There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
Job,34,23,"For he needeth not further to consider a man, that he should go before God in judgment."
Job,34,24,"He breaketh in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, and setteth others in their stead."
Job,34,25,"Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed."
Job,34,26,He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
Job,34,27,"Because they turned aside from following him, and would not have regard to any of his ways:"
Job,34,28,"So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted."
Job,34,29,"When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man, alike:"
Job,34,30,"That the godless man reign not, that there be none to ensnare the people."
Job,34,31,"For hath any said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:"
Job,34,32,"That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?"
Job,34,33,"Shall his recompence be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it? for thou must choose, and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest."
Job,34,34,"Men of understanding will say unto me, yea, every wise man that heareth me:"
Job,34,35,"Job speaketh without knowledge, and his words are without wisdom."
Job,34,36,"Would that Job were tried unto the end, because of his answering like wicked men."
Job,34,37,"For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God."
Job,35,1,"Moreover Elihu answered and said,"
Job,35,2,"Thinkest thou this to be thy right, or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God’s,"
Job,35,3,"That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?"
Job,35,4,"I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee."
Job,35,5,"Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the skies, which are higher than thou."
Job,35,6,"If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against him? and if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him."
Job,35,7,"If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?"
Job,35,8,Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit a son of man.
Job,35,9,By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; they cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job,35,10,"But none saith, Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night;"
Job,35,11,"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?"
Job,35,12,"There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men."
Job,35,13,"Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it."
Job,35,14,"How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, the cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!"
Job,35,15,"But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;"
Job,35,16,Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
Job,36,1,"Elihu also proceeded, and said,"
Job,36,2,"Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee: for I have yet somewhat to say on God’s behalf."
Job,36,3,"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
Job,36,4,For truly my words are not false: one that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
Job,36,5,"Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength of understanding."
Job,36,6,He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth to the afflicted their right.
Job,36,7,"He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings upon the throne he setteth them for ever, and they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"And if they be bound in fetters, and be taken in the cords of affliction;"
Job,36,9,"Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly."
Job,36,10,"He openeth also their ear to instruction, and commandeth that they return from iniquity."
Job,36,11,"If they hearken and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures."
Job,36,12,"But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge."
Job,36,13,But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: they cry not for help when he bindeth them.
Job,36,14,"They die in youth, and their life perisheth among the unclean."
Job,36,15,"He delivereth the afflicted by his affliction, and openeth their ear in oppression."
Job,36,16,"Yea, he would have led thee away out of distress into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which is set on thy table should be full of fatness."
Job,36,17,But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
Job,36,18,"Because there is wrath, beware lest thou be led away by thy sufficiency; neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside."
Job,36,19,"Will thy riches suffice, that thou be not in distress, or all the forces of thy strength?"
Job,36,20,"Desire not the night, when peoples are cut off in their place."
Job,36,21,"Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction."
Job,36,22,"Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: who is a teacher like unto him?"
Job,36,23,"Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?"
Job,36,24,"Remember that thou magnify his work, whereof men have sung."
Job,36,25,All men have looked thereon; man beholdeth it afar off.
Job,36,26,"Behold, God is great, and we know him not; the number of his years is unsearchable."
Job,36,27,"For he draweth up the drops of water, which distil in rain from his vapour:"
Job,36,28,Which the skies pour down and drop upon man abundantly.
Job,36,29,"Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion?"
Job,36,30,"Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; and he covereth the bottom of the sea."
Job,36,31,For by these he judgeth the peoples; he giveth meat in abundance.
Job,36,32,He covereth his hands with the lightning; and giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.
Job,36,33,"The noise thereof telleth concerning him, the cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up."
Job,37,1,"At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place."
Job,37,2,"Hearken ye unto the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth."
Job,37,3,"He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth."
Job,37,4,After it a voice roareth; he thundereth with the voice of his majesty: and he stayeth them not when his voice is heard.
Job,37,5,"God thundereth marvelously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend."
Job,37,6,"For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain."
Job,37,7,He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men whom he hath made may know it.
Job,37,8,"Then the beasts go into coverts, and remain in their dens."
Job,37,9,Out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm: and cold out of the north.
Job,37,10,By the breath of God ice is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
Job,37,11,"Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; he spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:"
Job,37,12,"And it is turned round about by his guidance, that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the habitable world."
Job,37,13,"Whether it be for correction, or for his land, or for mercy, that he cause it to come."
Job,37,14,"Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God."
Job,37,15,"Dost thou know how God layeth his charge upon them, and causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?"
Job,37,16,"Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?"
Job,37,17,"How thy garments are warm, when the earth is still by reason of the south wind?"
Job,37,18,"Canst thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong as a molten mirror?"
Job,37,19,Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
Job,37,20,Shall it be told him that I would speak? or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
Job,37,21,"And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them."
Job,37,22,Out of the north cometh golden splendour: God hath upon him terrible majesty.
Job,37,23,"Touching the Almighty, we can not find him out; he is excellent in power: and in judgment and plenteous justice he will not afflict."
Job,37,24,Men do therefore fear him: he regardeth not any that are wise of heart.
Job,38,1,"Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,"
Job,38,2,Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
Job,38,3,"Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me."
Job,38,4,"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding."
Job,38,5,"Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who stretched the line upon it?"
Job,38,6,Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
Job,38,7,"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
Job,38,8,"Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb;"
Job,38,9,"When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,"
Job,38,10,"And prescribed for it my decree, and set bars and doors,"
Job,38,11,"And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?"
Job,38,12,"Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began, and caused the dayspring to know its place;"
Job,38,13,"That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?"
Job,38,14,It is changed as clay under the seal; and all things stand forth as a garment:
Job,38,15,"And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm is broken."
Job,38,16,Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?
Job,38,17,Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?
Job,38,18,"Hast thou comprehended the breadth of the earth? declare, if thou knowest it all."
Job,38,19,"Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and as for darkness, where is the place thereof;"
Job,38,20,"That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof?"
Job,38,21,"Doubtless, thou knowest, for thou wast then born, and the number of thy days is great!"
Job,38,22,"Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,"
Job,38,23,"Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?"
Job,38,24,"By what way is the light parted, or the east wind scattered upon the earth?"
Job,38,25,"Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, or a way for the lightning of the thunder;"
Job,38,26,"To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;"
Job,38,27,To satisfy the waste and desolate ground; and to cause the tender grass to spring forth?
Job,38,28,Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
Job,38,29,"Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?"
Job,38,30,"The waters are hidden as with stone, and the face of the deep is frozen."
Job,38,31,"Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?"
Job,38,32,Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? or canst thou guide the Bear with her train?
Job,38,33,Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?
Job,38,34,"Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?"
Job,38,35,"Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?"
Job,38,36,Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the mind?
Job,38,37,"Who can number the clouds by wisdom? or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,"
Job,38,38,"When the dust runneth into a mass, and the clods cleave fast together?"
Job,38,39,"Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lioness? or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,"
Job,38,40,"When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?"
Job,38,41,"Who provideth for the raven his food, when his young ones cry unto God, and wander for lack of meat?"
Job,39,1,Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
Job,39,2,Canst thou number the months that they fulfill? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
Job,39,3,"They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, they cast out their sorrows."
Job,39,4,"Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up in the open field; they go forth, and return not again,"
Job,39,5,Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
Job,39,6,"Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place."
Job,39,7,"He scorneth the tumult of the city, neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver."
Job,39,8,"The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing."
Job,39,9,Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? or will he abide by thy crib?
Job,39,10,Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
Job,39,11,"Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave to him thy labour?"
Job,39,12,"Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather the corn of thy threshingfloor?"
Job,39,13,"The wing of the ostrich rejoiceth, but are her pinions and feathers kindly?"
Job,39,14,"For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, and warmeth them in the dust,"
Job,39,15,"And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may trample them."
Job,39,16,"She is hardened against her young ones, as if they were not hers: though her labour be in vain, she is without fear;"
Job,39,17,"Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding."
Job,39,18,"What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider."
Job,39,19,Hast thou given the horse his might? hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?
Job,39,20,Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? the glory of his snorting is terrible.
Job,39,21,"He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth out to meet the armed men."
Job,39,22,"He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed; neither turneth he back from the sword."
Job,39,23,"The quiver rattleth against him, the flashing spear and the javelin."
Job,39,24,He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet.
Job,39,25,"As oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith, Aha! and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting."
Job,39,26,"Doth the hawk soar by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?"
Job,39,27,"Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?"
Job,39,28,"She dwelleth on the rock, and hath her lodging there, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong hold."
Job,39,29,From thence she spieth out the prey; her eyes behold it afar off.
Job,39,30,"Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she."
Job,40,1,"Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,"
Job,40,2,"Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty? he that argueth with God, let him answer it."
Job,40,3,"Then Job answered the LORD, and said,"
Job,40,4,"Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer thee? I lay mine hand upon my mouth."
Job,40,5,"Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further. The LORD Challenges Job Again"
Job,40,6,"Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,"
Job,40,7,"Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me."
Job,40,8,"Wilt thou even disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?"
Job,40,9,Or hast thou an arm like God? and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
Job,40,10,Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity; and array thyself with honour and majesty.
Job,40,11,"Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger: and look upon every one that is proud, and abase him."
Job,40,12,"Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked where they stand."
Job,40,13,Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in the hidden place.
Job,40,14,Then wilt I also confess of thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
Job,40,15,"Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as all ox."
Job,40,16,"Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the muscles of his belly."
Job,40,17,He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his thighs are knit together.
Job,40,18,His bones are as tubes of brass; his limbs are like bars of iron.
Job,40,19,He is the chief of the ways of God: he only that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.
Job,40,20,Surely the mountains bring him forth food; where all the beasts of the field do play.
Job,40,21,"He lieth under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the fen."
Job,40,22,The lotus trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
Job,40,23,"Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not: he is confident, though Jordan swell even to his mouth."
Job,40,24,"Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?"
Job,41,1,Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish hook? or press down his tongue with a cord?
Job,41,2,Canst thou put a rope into his nose? or pierce his jaw through with a hook?
Job,41,3,Will he make many supplications unto thee? or will he speak soft words unto thee?
Job,41,4,"Will he make a covenant with thee, that thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?"
Job,41,5,Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
Job,41,6,Shall the bands of fishermen make traffic of him? shall they part him among the merchants?
Job,41,7,"Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish spears?"
Job,41,8,"Lay thine hand upon him; remember the battle, and do so no more."
Job,41,9,"Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?"
Job,41,10,None is so fierce that he dare stir him up: who then is he that can stand before me?
Job,41,11,"Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine."
Job,41,12,"I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his comely proportion."
Job,41,13,Who can strip off his outer garment? who shall come within his double bridle?
Job,41,14,Who can open the doors of his face? round about his teeth is terror.
Job,41,15,"His strong scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal."
Job,41,16,"One is so near to another, that no air can come between them."
Job,41,17,"They are joined one to another; they stick together, that they cannot be sundered."
Job,41,18,"His neesings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning."
Job,41,19,"Out of his mouth go burning torches, and sparks of fire leap forth."
Job,41,20,"Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, as of a seething pot and burning rushes."
Job,41,21,"His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth forth from his mouth."
Job,41,22,"In his neck abideth strength, and terror danceth before him."
Job,41,23,The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.
Job,41,24,"His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, firm as the nether millstone."
Job,41,25,"When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: by reason of consternation they are beside themselves."
Job,41,26,"If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft."
Job,41,27,"He counteth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood."
Job,41,28,The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
Job,41,29,Clubs are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.
Job,41,30,His underparts are like sharp potsherds: he spreadeth as it were a threshing wain upon the mire.
Job,41,31,He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like ointment.
Job,41,32,He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
Job,41,33,"Upon earth there is not his like, that is made without fear."
Job,41,34,He beholdeth every thing that is high: he is king over all the sons of pride.
Job,42,1,"Then Job answered the LORD, and said,"
Job,42,2,"I know that thou canst do all things, and that no purpose of thine can be restrained."
Job,42,3,"Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that which I understood not, things too wonderful for me, which I knew not."
Job,42,4,"Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak; I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me."
Job,42,5,"I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth thee,"

Jeremiah,19,1,"Thus said the LORD, Go, and buy a potter’s earthen bottle, and take of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests; 2and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee: 3and say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle."
Jeremiah,19,4,"Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom they knew not, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents; 5and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind: 6therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Topheth,"
Jeremiah,19,7,"And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of them that seek their life: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the"

Jeremiah,19,10,"Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee, 11and shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter’s vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place"
Jeremiah,19,12,"Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, even making this city as Topheth: 13and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods."
Jeremiah,19,14,"Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in"

Jeremiah,20,7,"O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am become a laughingstock all the day, every one mocketh me."
Jeremiah,20,8,"For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and spoil: because the word of the LORD is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day."
Jeremiah,20,9,"And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in mine heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot contain."
Jeremiah,20,10,"For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, say all my familiar friends, they that watch for my halting; peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him."

Jeremiah,20,15,"Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad."
Jeremiah,20,16,"And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontide; 17because he slew me not from the womb; and so my mother should have been my grave, and her womb always great."
Jeremiah,20,18,"Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?"
Jeremiah,21,1,"The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashhur the"

Jeremiah,21,10,"For I have set my face upon this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. A Message to the House of David"
Jeremiah,21,11,"And touching the house of the king of Judah, hear ye the word of the LORD:"
Jeremiah,21,12,"O house of David, thus saith the LORD, Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings."
Jeremiah,21,13,"Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and of the rock of the plain, saith the LORD; ye which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?"

Jeremiah,22,12,"But in the place whither they have led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more. A Warning about Jehoiakim"
Jeremiah,22,13,"Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that useth his neighbour’s service without wages, and giveth him not his hire; 14that saith, I will build me a wide house and spacious chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion."
Jeremiah,22,15,"Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice? then it was well with him."
Jeremiah,22,16,He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not this to know me? saith the LORD.
Jeremiah,22,17,"But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it."
Jeremiah,22,18,"Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!"

Jeremiah,22,20,"Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan: and cry from Abarim; for all thy lovers are destroyed."
Jeremiah,22,21,"I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice."
Jeremiah,22,22,"The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness."
Jeremiah,22,23,"O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail! A Warning to Coniah"
Jeremiah,22,24,"As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence; 25and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king"
Jeremiah,22,26,"And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare"
Jeremiah,22,27,"But to the land whereunto their soul longeth to return, thither shall they not return."
Jeremiah,22,28,"Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they know not?"
Jeremiah,22,29,"O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD."

Jeremiah,23,6,"In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, The LORD is our righteousness."
Jeremiah,23,7,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, As the LORD liveth, which brought up the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; 8but, As the LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land. Lying Prophets"
Jeremiah,23,9,"Concerning the prophets. Mine heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome; because of the LORD, and because of his holy words."
Jeremiah,23,10,"For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up; and their course is evil, and their force is not right. 11for both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,12,"Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,13,"And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err."
Jeremiah,23,14,"In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen an horrible thing; they commit adultery, and walk in lies, and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah."
Jeremiah,23,15,"Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land."
Jeremiah,23,16,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you; they teach you vanity: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,17,"They say continually unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come upon you."
Jeremiah,23,18,"For who hath stood in the council of the LORD, that he should perceive and hear his word? who hath marked my word, and heard it?"
Jeremiah,23,19,"Behold, the tempest of the LORD, even his fury, is gone forth, yea, a whirling tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked."
Jeremiah,23,20,"The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it perfectly."
Jeremiah,23,21,"I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I spake not unto them, yet they prophesied."
Jeremiah,23,22,"But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings."
Jeremiah,23,23,"Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?"
Jeremiah,23,24,Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.
Jeremiah,23,25,"I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed,"
Jeremiah,23,26,"How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies; even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart? 27which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers forgat my name for Baal."
Jeremiah,23,28,"The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my"
Jeremiah,23,29,Is not my word like as fire? saith
Jeremiah,23,30,"Therefore, behold, I am against the"
Jeremiah,23,31,"Behold, I am against"
Jeremiah,23,32,"Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; neither shall they profit this people at all, saith the LORD. False Prophecies"
Jeremiah,23,33,"And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the"
Jeremiah,23,34,"And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish"
Jeremiah,23,35,"Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother,"
Jeremiah,23,36,And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man’s own word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the
Jeremiah,23,37,"Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What"
Jeremiah,23,38,"But if ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD: Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD; 39therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave unto you and to your fathers, away from my presence: 40and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten."
Jeremiah,24,1,"The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of the LORD; after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to"
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very"
Jeremiah,24,3,"Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad."
Jeremiah,24,4,"And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,"
Jeremiah,24,5,"Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of"
Jeremiah,24,6,"For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up."
Jeremiah,24,7,"And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this"
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places"
Jeremiah,24,10,"And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers."
Jeremiah,25,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah; the same was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; 2the which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,"
Jeremiah,25,3,"From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising"
Jeremiah,25,4,"And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear; 5saying, Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers, from of old and even for evermore: 6and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with"
Jeremiah,25,7,"Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt."
Jeremiah,25,8,"Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words, 9behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and I will send unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment,"
Jeremiah,25,10,"Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones,"
Jeremiah,25,11,"And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years."
Jeremiah,25,12,"And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will"

Jeremiah,25,27,"And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you."
Jeremiah,25,28,"And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them,"
Jeremiah,25,29,"For, lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts."
Jeremiah,25,30,"Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar against his fold; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth."

Jeremiah,25,32,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,33,"And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground. The Cry of the Shepherds"
Jeremiah,25,34,"Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter are fully come, and I will break you in pieces, and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel."
Jeremiah,25,35,"And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape."
Jeremiah,25,36,"A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the howling of the principal of the flock! for the LORD layeth waste their pasture."
Jeremiah,25,37,And the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
Jeremiah,25,38,"He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword, and because of his fierce anger."

Jeremiah,26,19,"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and entreat the favour of the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus should we commit great evil against our own souls, The Prophet Uriah"
Jeremiah,26,20,"And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah: 21and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt: 22and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt: 23and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people."
Jeremiah,26,24,"But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death."
Jeremiah,27,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word unto"
Jeremiah,27,2,"Thus saith the LORD to me: Make thee bands and bars, and put them upon thy neck; 3and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah; 4and give them a charge unto their masters;"
Jeremiah,27,5,"I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by"
Jeremiah,27,6,"And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the"
Jeremiah,27,7,"And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him."
Jeremiah,27,8,"And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence,"
Jeremiah,27,9,"But as for you, hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: 10for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far"
Jeremiah,27,11,"But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that nation will I let remain in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein."
Jeremiah,27,12,"And I spake to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under"
Jeremiah,27,13,"Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken concerning"
Jeremiah,27,14,"And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you."
Jeremiah,27,15,"For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you."
Jeremiah,27,16,"Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD’S house shall"
Jeremiah,27,17,Hearken not unto
Jeremiah,27,18,"But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king"
Jeremiah,27,19,"For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels, that are left in this city, 20which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 21yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels"
Jeremiah,27,22,"They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place."
Jeremiah,28,1,"And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake"
Jeremiah,28,2,"Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,3,"Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD’S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon: 4and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,5,"Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD, 6even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the"
Jeremiah,28,7,Nevertheless
Jeremiah,28,8,"The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great"
Jeremiah,28,9,"The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him."
Jeremiah,28,10,"Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it."
Jeremiah,28,11,"And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way."
Jeremiah,28,12,"Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the"
Jeremiah,28,13,"Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the"
Jeremiah,28,14,"For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him"
Jeremiah,28,15,"Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now,"
Jeremiah,28,16,"Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken rebellion against the LORD."
Jeremiah,28,17,So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah,29,1,"Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon: 2(after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen-mother, and the eunuchs, and the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;) 3by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king"

Jeremiah,29,13,"And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all year heart."
Jeremiah,29,14,"And I will be found of you, saith the LORD, and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again unto the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive."
Jeremiah,29,15,"For ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon. 16for thus saith the LORD concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity; 17thus saith the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile"
Jeremiah,29,18,"And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them: 19because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, wherewith I sent unto them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would"
Jeremiah,29,20,"Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,21,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; 22and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king Babylon roasted in the fire: 23because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I commanded them not; and I am he that knoweth, and am witness, saith the LORD. The Message to Shemaiah"
Jeremiah,29,24,"And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,25,"Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,26,"The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put"
Jeremiah,29,27,"Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you, 28forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?"
Jeremiah,29,29,And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,29,30,Then came the word
Jeremiah,29,31,"Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in a lie; 32therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he behold the good that I will do unto my people, saith the LORD: because he hath spoken rebellion against the LORD."
Jeremiah,30,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,30,2,"Thus speaketh the LORD, the God of Israel,"
Jeremiah,30,3,"For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it."
Jeremiah,30,4,And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
Jeremiah,30,5,"For thus saith the LORD: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,"Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?"
Jeremiah,30,7,"Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it."
Jeremiah,30,8,"And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bands; and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him: 9but they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them."
Jeremiah,30,10,"Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid."
Jeremiah,30,11,"For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee with judgment, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished."
Jeremiah,30,12,"For thus saith the LORD, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous."
Jeremiah,30,13,"There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines."
Jeremiah,30,14,"All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one; for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased."
Jeremiah,30,15,"Why criest thou for thy hurt? thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee."
Jeremiah,30,16,"Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey."
Jeremiah,30,17,"For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they have called thee an outcast, saying, It is Zion, whom no man seeketh after."
Jeremiah,30,18,"Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling places; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof."
Jeremiah,30,19,"And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small."
Jeremiah,30,20,"Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them."
Jeremiah,30,21,"And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith the LORD."
Jeremiah,30,22,"And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God."
Jeremiah,30,23,"Behold, the tempest of the LORD, even his fury, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked."
Jeremiah,30,24,"The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it."
Jeremiah,31,1,"At that time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people."
Jeremiah,31,2,"Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest."
Jeremiah,31,3,"The LORD appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee."
Jeremiah,31,4,"Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: again shalt thou be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry."
Jeremiah,31,5,"Again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy the fruit thereof."
Jeremiah,31,6,"For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God."
Jeremiah,31,7,"For thus saith the LORD, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel."
Jeremiah,31,8,"Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall they return hither."
Jeremiah,31,9,"They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn."
Jeremiah,31,10,"Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off; and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock."
Jeremiah,31,11,"For the LORD hath ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he."
Jeremiah,31,12,"And they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together unto the goodness of the LORD, to the corn, and to the wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all."
Jeremiah,31,13,"Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow."
Jeremiah,31,14,"And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,15,"Thus saith the LORD: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuseth to be comforted for her children, because they are not."
Jeremiah,31,16,"Thus saith the LORD: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy."
Jeremiah,31,17,"And there is hope for thy latter end, saith the LORD; and thy children shall come again to their own border."
Jeremiah,31,18,"I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus, Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God."
Jeremiah,31,19,"Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth."
Jeremiah,31,20,"Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,21,"Set thee up waymarks, make thee guide-posts: set thine heart toward the highway, even the way by which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities."
Jeremiah,31,22,"How long wilt thou go hither and thither, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall encompass a man."
Jeremiah,31,23,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity: The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, O mountain of holiness."

Jeremiah,31,28,"And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down, and to overthrow and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,29,"In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge."
Jeremiah,31,30,"But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge."
Jeremiah,31,31,"Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 32not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake,"
Jeremiah,31,33,"But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the LORD; I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people: 34and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more."
Jeremiah,31,35,"Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which stirreth up the sea, that the waves thereof roar; the LORD of hosts is his name:"
Jeremiah,31,36,"If these ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever."
Jeremiah,31,37,"Thus saith the LORD: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,38,"Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of"
Jeremiah,31,39,And the measuring line shall yet go out straight onward unto

Jeremiah,32,3,"For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; 4and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; 5and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?"
Jeremiah,32,6,"And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,"

Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD."
Jeremiah,32,9,"And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and weighed him the money,"
Jeremiah,32,10,"And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and"
Jeremiah,32,11,"So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, according to the law and custom, and that which was open: 12and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews"
Jeremiah,32,13,"And I charged Baruch before them, saying,"

Jeremiah,32,36,"And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:"
Jeremiah,32,37,"Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely: 38and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: 39and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever; for the good of them, and of their children after them: 40and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good;"

Ezekiel,18,4,"Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die."
Ezekiel,18,5,"But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 6and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour’s wife, neither hath come near to a woman in her separation; 7and hath not wronged any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; 8he that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man, 9hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,18,10,"If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth any one of these things, 11and that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour’s wife, 12hath wronged the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, 13hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations: he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him."
Ezekiel,18,14,"Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins, which he hath done, and feareth, and doth not such like, 15that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour’s wife, 16neither hath wronged any, hath not taken aught to pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, 17that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not"

Ezekiel,18,20,"The soul that sinneth, it shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him."
Ezekiel,18,21,"But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that"
Ezekiel,18,22,None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.

Ezekiel,18,27,"Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed,"
Ezekiel,18,28,"Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die."
Ezekiel,18,29,"Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?"
Ezekiel,18,30,"Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD."

Ezekiel,19,1,"Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, 2and say, What was thy mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps."
Ezekiel,19,3,"And she brought up one of her whelps; he became a young lion: and he learned to catch the prey, he devoured men."
Ezekiel,19,4,The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit: and they brought him with hooks unto the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel,19,5,"Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion."
Ezekiel,19,6,"And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion: and he learned to catch the prey, he devoured men."
Ezekiel,19,7,"And he knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the noise of his roaring."
Ezekiel,19,8,Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces: and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.
Ezekiel,19,9,"And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strong holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel."
Ezekiel,19,10,"Thy mother was like a vine, in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters."
Ezekiel,19,11,"And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches."
Ezekiel,19,12,"But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them."
Ezekiel,19,13,"And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land."
Ezekiel,19,14,"And fire is gone out of the rods of her branches, it hath devoured her fruit, so that there is in her no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation."

Daniel,1,1,In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto
Daniel,1,2,"And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god."
Daniel,1,3,"And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the nobles; 4youths in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of"
Daniel,1,5,"And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they might"
Daniel,1,6,"Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael,"
Daniel,1,7,"And the prince of the eunuchs gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed- nego. Daniel’s Faithfulness"
Daniel,1,8,"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile"
Daniel,1,9,Now God made Daniel to find favour and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.
Daniel,1,10,"And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Darnel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the youths which are of your"

Daniel,1,12,"Prove thy servants,"
Daniel,1,13,"Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king’s meat; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants."
Daniel,1,14,"So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days."
Daniel,1,15,"And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths which did eat of"
Daniel,1,16,"So the steward took away their meat, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse. Daniel’s Wisdom"
Daniel,1,17,"Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams."
Daniel,1,18,"And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the"

Daniel,1,20,"And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them,"
Daniel,1,21,And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.
Daniel,2,1,And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his

Daniel,2,3,"And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream."
Daniel,2,4,"Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants"
Daniel,2,5,"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye"

Daniel,2,11,"And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."
Daniel,2,12,"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of"
Daniel,2,13,"So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain. The Dream Revealed to Daniel"
Daniel,2,14,"Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon; 15he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel."
Daniel,2,16,"And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would shew the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 18that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,19,Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel,2,20,"Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:"
Daniel,2,21,"And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: 22he revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him."
Daniel,2,23,"I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee: for thou hast made known unto us the king’s matter. Daniel Interprets the Dream"
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man"
Daniel,2,26,"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, shew unto the king; 28but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these: 29as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what"
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart."
Daniel,2,31,"Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose"
Daniel,2,32,"As for this image, his head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, 33his legs"
Daniel,2,34,"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands,"
Daniel,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
Daniel,2,37,"Thou, O king, art king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory; 38and wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all: thou art the head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth."
Daniel,2,40,And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth
Daniel,2,41,"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there"
Daniel,2,42,"And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and"
Daniel,2,43,"And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay."
Daniel,2,44,"And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and"
Daniel,2,45,"Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.

Daniel,2,46,"Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they"

Daniel,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Accused"
Daniel,3,8,"Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews."
Daniel,3,9,They
Daniel,3,10,"Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image: 11and whoso falleth"
Daniel,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."
Daniel,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego."
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden"
Daniel,3,15,"Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no"
Daniel,3,17,"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the"
Daniel,3,18,"But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. The Fiery Furnace"
Daniel,3,19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace"
Daniel,3,20,"And he commanded certain mighty men that were in is army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their other garments,"
Daniel,3,22,"Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that"
Daniel,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste: he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto"
Daniel,3,25,"He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the"
Daniel,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then"
Daniel,3,27,"And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them."
Daniel,3,28,"Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall"
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,4,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth;"
Daniel,4,2,It hath seemed good unto me to shew the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me.
Daniel,4,3,"How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation. Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream of a Great Tree"
Daniel,4,4,"I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace."
Daniel,4,5,I saw a dream which
Daniel,4,6,"Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me"
Daniel,4,7,"Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the"
Daniel,4,8,"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream"
Daniel,4,9,"O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof."
Daniel,4,10,"Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth."
Daniel,4,12,"The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed of it."
Daniel,4,13,"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven."
Daniel,4,14,"He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches."
Daniel,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth: 16let his heart be changed from man’s and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him."
Daniel,4,17,"The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the lowest of men."
Daniel,4,18,"This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen: and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. Daniel Interprets the Second Dream"
Daniel,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation"
Daniel,4,20,"The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; 21whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: 22it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the"
Daniel,4,23,"And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him; 24this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king: 25that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to"

Daniel,4,28,All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.

Daniel,4,31,"While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: the kingdom is departed from thee. 32and thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to"
Daniel,4,33,"The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws. Nebuchadnezzar Restored"
Daniel,4,34,"And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation:"
Daniel,4,35,"And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?"
Daniel,4,36,"At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I"
Daniel,4,37,"Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase."
Daniel,5,1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand."
Daniel,5,2,"Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his"
Daniel,5,3,"Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords,"
Daniel,5,4,"They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. The Handwriting on the Wall"

Daniel,5,8,Then came in all the king’s
Daniel,5,9,"Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed."
Daniel,5,10,"Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance"
Daniel,5,11,"There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him: and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; 12forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation. Daniel Interprets the Handwriting"
Daniel,5,13,"Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of"
Daniel,5,14,"I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding"
Daniel,5,15,"And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof:"
Daniel,5,16,"But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,17,"Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation."
Daniel,5,18,"O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty: 19and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept"
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: 21and he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven: until he knew that the Most High God ruleth in the kingdom of men,"
Daniel,5,22,"And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this; 23but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is,"
Daniel,5,24,"Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed."
Daniel,5,25,"And this is the writing that was inscribed, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN."
Daniel,5,26,This is the
Daniel,5,27,TEKEL;
Daniel,5,28,"PERES; thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians."
Daniel,5,29,"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain.
Daniel,5,31,"And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old."
Daniel,6,1,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty satraps, which should be throughout the whole kingdom; 2and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps"

Darius Honors God"
Daniel,6,25,"Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you."
Daniel,6,26,"I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end:"

Daniel,7,8,"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. Daniel’s Vision of the Ancient of Days"
Daniel,7,9,"I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire."
Daniel,7,10,"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."

Daniel,8,14,"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. Gabriel Interprets Daniel’s Vision"

Daniel,8,26,And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come.

Hosea,1,7,"But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen."
Hosea,1,8,"Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son."
Hosea,1,9,"And the LORD said, Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God."
Hosea,1,10,"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God."
Hosea,1,11,"And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up from the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel."
Hosea,2,1,"Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah."
Hosea,2,2,"Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts; 3lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst;"
Hosea,2,4,"Yea, upon her children will I have no mercy; for they be children of whoredom. 5for their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink."
Hosea,2,6,"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will make a fence against her, that she shall not find her paths."
Hosea,2,7,"And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now."
Hosea,2,8,"For she did not know that I gave her the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"Therefore will I take back my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness."
Hosea,2,10,"And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand."
Hosea,2,11,"I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies."
Hosea,2,12,"And I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them."
Hosea,2,13,"And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, unto which she burned incense; when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD. God’s Mercy to Israel"
Hosea,2,14,"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her."
Hosea,2,15,"And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali."
Hosea,2,17,"For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name."
Hosea,2,18,"And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely."
Hosea,2,19,"And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies."
Hosea,2,20,I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.
Hosea,2,21,"And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, saith the LORD, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth; 22and the earth shall answer the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel."
Hosea,2,23,"And I wilt sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God."
Hosea,3,1,"And the LORD said unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend and an adulteress, even as the LORD loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins."
Hosea,3,2,"So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: 3and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt"
Hosea,3,4,"For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim. 5afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall come with fear unto the LORD and to his goodness in the latter days."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land."
Hosea,4,2,"There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood."
Hosea,4,3,"Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away."
Hosea,4,4,"Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest."
Hosea,4,5,"And thou shalt stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother."
Hosea,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children."
Hosea,4,7,"As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame."
Hosea,4,8,"They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity."
Hosea,4,9,"And it shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and will reward them their doings."
Hosea,4,10,"And they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD."
Hosea,4,11,Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.
Hosea,4,12,"My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredom hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God."
Hosea,4,13,"They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters commit whoredom, and your brides commit adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for they themselves go apart with whores, and they sacrifice with the harlots: and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown."
Hosea,4,15,"Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As the LORD liveth."
Hosea,4,16,"For Israel hath behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will the LORD feed them as a lamb in a large place."
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.
Hosea,4,18,Their drink is become sour: they commit whoredom continually; her rulers dearly love shame.
Hosea,4,19,The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
Hosea,5,1,"Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king, for unto you pertain the judgment; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor."
Hosea,5,2,And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all.
Hosea,5,3,"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed whoredom, Israel is defiled."
Hosea,5,4,"Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not the LORD."
Hosea,5,5,And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them.
Hosea,5,6,They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them.
Hosea,5,7,They have dealt treacherously against the LORD; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields.
Hosea,5,8,"Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin."
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after the command."
Hosea,5,12,"Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness."
Hosea,5,13,"When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither shall he cure you of your wound."
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver."
Hosea,5,15,"I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly."
Hosea,6,1,"Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up."
Hosea,6,2,"After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him."
Hosea,6,3,"And let us know, let us follow on to know the LORD; his going forth is sure as the morning: and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth."
Hosea,6,4,"O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth early away."
Hosea,6,5,Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.
Hosea,6,6,"For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings."
Hosea,6,7,But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
Hosea,6,8,"Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, it is stained with blood."
Hosea,6,9,"And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness."
Hosea,6,10,"In the house of Israel I have seen an horrible thing: there whoredom is found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled."
Hosea,6,11,"Also, O Judah, there is an harvest appointed for thee, when I bring again the captivity of my people."
Hosea,7,1,"When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood: and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without."
Hosea,7,2,And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face.
Hosea,7,3,"They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies."
Hosea,7,4,"They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceaseth to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough until it be leavened."
Hosea,7,5,On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
Hosea,7,6,"For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire."
Hosea,7,7,"They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me."
Hosea,7,8,"Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned."
Hosea,7,9,"Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth it not."
Hosea,7,10,"And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: yet they have not returned unto the LORD their God, nor sought him, for all this."
Hosea,7,11,"And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria."
Hosea,7,12,"When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven: I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard."
Hosea,7,13,"Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me."
Hosea,7,14,"And they have not cried unto me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, they rebel against me."
Hosea,7,15,"Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me."
Hosea,7,16,"They return, but not to him that is on high; they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt."
Hosea,8,1,"SET the trumpet to thy mouth. As an eagle he cometh against the house of the LORD: because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law."
Hosea,8,2,"They shall cry unto me, My God, we Israel know thee."
Hosea,8,3,Israel hath cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,"They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off."
Hosea,8,5,"He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?"
Hosea,8,6,"For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God: yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces."
Hosea,8,7,"For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing corn; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up."
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.
Hosea,8,9,"For they are gone up to Assyria, like a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers."
Hosea,8,10,"Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be minished by reason of the burden of the king of princes."
Hosea,8,11,"Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, altars have been unto him to sin."
Hosea,8,12,"Though I write for him my law in ten thousand precepts, they are counted as a strange thing."
Hosea,8,13,"As for the sacrifices of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof."
Hosea,9,1,"Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved hire upon every cornfloor."
Hosea,9,2,"The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her."
Hosea,9,3,"They shall not dwell in the LORD’S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria."
Hosea,9,4,"They shall not pour out wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of the LORD."
Hosea,9,5,"What will ye do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?"
Hosea,9,6,"For, lo, they are gone away from destruction, yet Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tents."
Hosea,9,7,"The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man that hath the spirit is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great."
Hosea,9,8,"Ephraim was a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler’s snare is in all his ways, and enmity in the house of his God."
Hosea,9,9,"They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins."
Hosea,9,10,"I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved."
Hosea,9,11,"As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception."
Hosea,9,12,"Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there be not a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!"
Hosea,9,13,"Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer."
Hosea,9,14,"Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts."
Hosea,9,15,All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house: I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters.
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb."
Hosea,9,17,"My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations."
Hosea,10,1,"Israel is a luxuriant vine, which putteth forth his fruit: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly pillars."
Hosea,10,2,"Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he shall smite their altars, he shall spoil their pillars."
Hosea,10,3,"Surely now shall they say, We have no king: for we fear not the LORD; and the king, what can he do for us?"
Hosea,10,4,"They speak vain words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field."
Hosea,10,5,"The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it."
Hosea,10,6,"It also shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel."
Hosea,10,7,"As for Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water."
Hosea,10,8,"The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us."
Hosea,10,9,"O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; that the battle against the children of iniquity should not overtake them in Gibeah."
Hosea,10,10,"When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions."
Hosea,10,11,"And Ephraim is an heifer that is taught, that loveth to tread out the corn; but I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods."
Hosea,10,12,"Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you."
Hosea,10,13,"Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men."
Hosea,10,14,"Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her children."
Hosea,10,15,So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.
Hosea,11,1,"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt."
Hosea,11,2,"As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images."
Hosea,11,3,Yet I taught Ephraim to go; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
Hosea,11,4,"I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat before them."
Hosea,11,5,"He shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return."
Hosea,11,6,"And the sword shall fall upon his cities, and shall consume his bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels."
Hosea,11,7,"And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they call them to him that is on high, none at all will exalt him. God’s Love for Israel"
Hosea,11,8,"How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together."
Hosea,11,9,"I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city."
Hosea,11,10,"They shall walk after the LORD, who shall roar like a lion: for he shall roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west."
Hosea,11,11,"They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith the LORD."
Hosea,11,12,"Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One."
Hosea,12,1,"Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he continually multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt."
Hosea,12,2,"The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him."
Hosea,12,3,"In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God: 4yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spake with us; 5even the LORD, the God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial."
Hosea,12,6,"Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually."
Hosea,12,7,"He is a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress."
Hosea,12,8,"And Ephraim said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth: in all my labours they shall find in me none iniquity that were sin."
Hosea,12,9,"But I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast."
Hosea,12,10,"I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes."

Hosea,12,12,"And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep."
Hosea,12,13,"And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved."
Hosea,12,14,"Ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him."
Hosea,13,1,"When Ephraim spake, there was trembling; he exalted himself in Israel: but when he offended in Baal, he died."
Hosea,13,2,"And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, even idols according to their own understanding, all of them the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves."
Hosea,13,3,"Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the dew that passeth early away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing-floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney."

Amos,8,14,"They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, As thy God, O Dan, liveth; and, As the way of Beer- sheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again."
Amos,9,1,"I SAW the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Smite the chapiters, that the thresholds may shake: and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape."
Amos,9,2,"Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down."
Amos,9,3,"And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them."
Amos,9,4,"And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good."
Amos,9,5,"For the Lord, the GOD of hosts, is he that toucheth the land and it melteth, and all that dwell therein shall mourn; and it shall rise up wholly like the River; and shall sink again, like the River of Egypt; 6it is he that buildeth his chambers in the heaven, and hath founded his vault upon the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; the LORD is his name."
Amos,9,7,"Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?"

Amos,9,9,"For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth."

Obadiah,1,1,"The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom: We have heard tidings from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle."
Obadiah,1,2,"Behold, I have made thee small among the nations: thou art greatly despised."

Obadiah,1,5,"If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not steal till they had enough? if grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes?"
Obadiah,1,6,How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden treasures sought up!
Obadiah,1,7,"All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee on thy way, even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread lay a snare under thee: there is none understanding in him."
Obadiah,1,8,"Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?"
Obadiah,1,9,"And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter."
Obadiah,1,10,"For the violence done to thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever."
Obadiah,1,11,"In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them."
Obadiah,1,12,"But look not thou on the day of thy brother in the day of his disaster, and rejoice not over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither speak proudly in the day of distress."
Obadiah,1,13,"Enter not into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, look not thou on their affliction in the day of their calamity, neither lay ye hands on their substance in the day of their calamity."
Obadiah,1,14,"And stand thou not in the crossway, to cut off those of his that escape; and deliver not up those of his that remain in the day of distress. The Deliverance of Israel"
Obadiah,1,15,"For the day of the LORD is near upon all the nations: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee; thy dealing shall return upon thine own head."
Obadiah,1,16,"For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and swallow down, and shall be as though they had not been."
Obadiah,1,17,"But in mount Zion there shall be those that escape, and it shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions."
Obadiah,1,18,"And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall burn among them, and devour them: and there shall not be any remaining to the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it."
Obadiah,1,19,"And they of the South shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the lowland the Philistines and they shall possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead."
Obadiah,1,20,"And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel, which are among the Canaanites, shall possess even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the South."
Obadiah,1,21,And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD’S.

Jonah,1,6,"So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not."
Jonah,1,7,"And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause"
Jonah,1,8,"Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou?"
Jonah,1,9,"And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land."
Jonah,1,10,"Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, What is this that thou hast done? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them. Jonah Cast into the Sea"
Jonah,1,11,"Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea"
Jonah,1,12,"And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you."
Jonah,1,13,Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew
Jonah,1,14,"Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee."
Jonah,1,15,"So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging."
Jonah,1,16,"Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows."
Jonah,1,17,And the LORD prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
Jonah,2,1,Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly.
Jonah,2,2,"And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he answered me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice."
Jonah,2,3,"For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me; all thy waves and thy billows passed over me."
Jonah,2,4,"And I said, am cast out from before thine eyes; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple."
Jonah,2,5,"The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; the deep was round about me; the weeds were wrapped about my head."
Jonah,2,6,"I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars closed upon me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God."
Jonah,2,7,"When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple."
Jonah,2,8,They that regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

Jonah,3,1,"And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,"
Jonah,3,2,"Arise, go unto Nineveh, that"

Jonah,3,4,"And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown."
Jonah,3,5,"And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the"
Jonah,3,6,"And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose"
Jonah,3,7,"And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: 8but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let"
Jonah,3,9,"Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?"
Jonah,3,10,"And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not."
Jonah,4,1,"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry."
Jonah,4,2,"And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I hasted to flee unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and full of compassion, slow to anger, and"

Jonah,4,7,But God prepared
Jonah,4,8,"And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live."
Jonah,4,9,"And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry"
Jonah,4,10,"And the LORD said, Thou hast had pity on the gourd; for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: 11and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city; wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?"
Micah,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem."
Micah,1,2,"Hear, ye peoples, all of you; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple."
Micah,1,3,"For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth."
Micah,1,4,"And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place."
Micah,1,5,"For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?"
Micah,1,6,"Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as the plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof."
Micah,1,7,"And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate: for of the hire of an harlot hath she gathered them, and unto the hire of an harlot shall they return. Weeping and Mourning"
Micah,1,8,"For this will I wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a mourning like the ostriches."
Micah,1,9,"For her wounds are incurable: for it is come even unto Judah; it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem."
Micah,1,10,"Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all: at Beth-le-Aphrah have I rolled myself in the dust."
Micah,1,11,"Pass ye away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the stay thereof."
Micah,1,12,For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good: because evil is come down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.
Micah,1,13,"Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee."
Micah,1,14,Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel.

Micah,1,16,"Make thee bald, and poll thee for the children of thy delight: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee."

Micah,2,2,"And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage."
Micah,2,3,"Therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk haughtily; for it is an evil time."
Micah,2,4,"In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he changeth the portion of my people: how doth he remove it from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields."

Micah,2,6,"Prophesy ye not, thus they prophesy. They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart."
Micah,2,7,"Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?"
Micah,2,8,But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.
Micah,2,9,The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever.
Micah,2,10,"Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction."
Micah,2,11,"If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people. The Remnant of Israel (Micah 5:7–15)"
Micah,2,12,"I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah: as a flock in the midst of their pasture, they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men."

Micah,3,1,"And I said, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know judgment? 2who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones; 3who also eat the flesh of my people; and they flay their skin from off them, and break their bones: yea, they chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron."
Micah,3,4,"Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not answer them: yea, he will hide his face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings."
Micah,3,5,"Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that bite with their teeth and cry, Peace; and whoso putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:"
Micah,3,6,"Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them."
Micah,3,7,"And the seers shall be ashamed, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their lips: for there is no answer of God."
Micah,3,8,"But I truly am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin."
Micah,3,9,"Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity."
Micah,3,10,"They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity."
Micah,3,11,"The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us."
Micah,3,12,"Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest."
Micah,4,1,"But in the latter days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the LORD’S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it."
Micah,4,2,"And many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 3and he shall judge between many peoples, and shall reprove strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."
Micah,4,4,But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it.
Micah,4,5,"For all the peoples will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever. The Restoration of Zion (Zechariah 8:1–23)"
Micah,4,6,"In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven away, and her that I have afflicted; 7and I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever."
Micah,4,8,"And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come; yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem."
Micah,4,9,"Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail?"
Micah,4,10,"Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon; there shalt thou be rescued; there shall the LORD redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies."
Micah,4,11,"And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see its desire upon Zion."
Micah,4,12,"But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshingfloor."
Micah,4,13,"Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and thou shalt devote their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth."

Micah,5,8,"And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and there is none to deliver."
Micah,5,9,"Let thine hand be lifted up above thine adversaries, and let all thine enemies be cut off."
Micah,5,10,"And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and will destroy thy chariots: 11and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and will throw down all thy strong holds:"
Micah,5,12,And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers: 13and I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands. 14and I will pluck up thine Asherim out of the midst of thee: and I will destroy thy cities.
Micah,5,15,And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the nations which hearkened not.

Micah,6,3,"O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me."

Micah,6,5,"O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; remember from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of the LORD."
Micah,6,6,"Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? 7will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"
Micah,6,8,"He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? The Punishment of Israel"

Micah,6,10,"Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?"
Micah,6,11,"Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights?"
Micah,6,12,"For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth."

Micah,6,15,"Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap: thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink the wine."
Micah,6,16,"For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels: that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing; and ye shall bear the reproach of my people."

Micah,7,2,"The godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net."
Micah,7,3,"Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge is ready for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth the mischief of his soul: thus they weave it together."
Micah,7,4,"The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity."
Micah,7,5,"Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom."

Micah,7,8,"Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me."
Micah,7,9,"I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him; until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness."
Micah,7,10,"Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her; which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? Mine eyes shall behold her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets."
Micah,7,11,A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed.
Micah,7,12,"In that day shall they come unto thee, from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain."
Micah,7,13,"Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings. God’s Compassion on Israel"
Micah,7,14,"Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old."
Micah,7,15,As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvelous things.
Micah,7,16,"The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf."
Micah,7,17,"They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places: they shall come with fear unto the LORD our God, and shall be afraid because of thee."
Micah,7,18,"Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy."
Micah,7,19,He will turn again and have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot: and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
Micah,7,20,"Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old."
Nahum,1,1,The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
Nahum,1,2,"The LORD is a jealous God and avengeth; the LORD avengeth and is full of wrath; the LORD taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies."
Nahum,1,3,"The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means clear the guilty: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet."
Nahum,1,4,"He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth."
Nahum,1,5,"The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt; and the earth is upheaved at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein."
Nahum,1,6,"Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him."
Nahum,1,7,"The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that put their trust in him."
Nahum,1,8,"But with an overrunning flood he will make a full end of the place thereof, and will pursue his enemies into darkness."
Nahum,1,9,What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make a full end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.
Nahum,1,10,"For though they be like tangled thorns, told be drenched as it were in their drink, they shall be devoured utterly as dry stubble."
Nahum,1,11,"There is one gone forth out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, that counselleth wickedness."
Nahum,1,12,"Thus saith the LORD: Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more."
Nahum,1,13,"And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder."
Nahum,1,14,"And the LORD hath given commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make thy grave; for thou art vile."
Nahum,1,15,"Behold, upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah, perform thy vows: for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off."
Nahum,2,1,"He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily."
Nahum,2,2,"For the LORD bringeth again the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches."
Nahum,2,3,"The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the spears are shaken terribly."
Nahum,2,4,"The chariots rage in the streets, they justle one against another in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches, they run like the lightnings."
Nahum,2,5,"He remembereth his worthies: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared."
Nahum,2,6,"The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved."
Nahum,2,7,"And Huzzab is uncovered, she is carried away, and her handmaids mourn as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts."
Nahum,2,8,"But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away; Stand, stand, they cry; but none looketh back."
Nahum,2,9,"Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store, the glory of all pleasant furniture."
Nahum,2,10,"She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale."
Nahum,2,11,"Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked, the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid?"
Nahum,2,12,"The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin."
Nahum,2,13,"Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard."
Nahum,3,1,Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and rapine; the prey departeth not.
Nahum,3,2,"The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of wheels; and pransing horses, and jumping chariots; 3the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, and the glittering spear; and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of carcases: and there is none end of the corpses; they stumble upon their corpses: 4because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well favoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts."
Nahum,3,5,"Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face; and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame."
Nahum,3,6,"And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock."
Nahum,3,7,"And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?"
Nahum,3,8,"Art thou better than No-amon, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about her; whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was of the sea?"
Nahum,3,9,"Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers."
Nahum,3,10,"Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains."
Nahum,3,11,"Thou also shalt be drunken, thou shalt be hid; thou also shalt seek a strong hold because of the enemy."
Nahum,3,12,"All thy fortresses shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater."
Nahum,3,13,"Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women; the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire hath devoured thy bars."
Nahum,3,14,"Draw thee water for the siege, strengthen thy fortresses: go into the clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the brickkiln."
Nahum,3,15,"There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall devour thee like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locust."
Nahum,3,16,"Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away."
Nahum,3,17,"Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are."
Nahum,3,18,"Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy worthies are at rest: thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and there is none to gather them."
Nahum,3,19,There is no assuaging of thy hurt; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee clap the hands over thee; for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
Habakkuk,1,1,The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
Habakkuk,1,2,"O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save."
Habakkuk,1,3,"Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there is strife, and contention riseth up."
Habakkuk,1,4,"Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore judgment goeth forth perverted. The LORD’s Answer"
Habakkuk,1,5,"Behold ye among the nations, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I work a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you."
Habakkuk,1,6,"For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation; which march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs."
Habakkuk,1,7,They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.
Habakkuk,1,8,"Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen spread themselves: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour."
Habakkuk,1,9,They come all of them for violence; their faces are set eagerly as the east wind; and they gather captives as the sand.
Habakkuk,1,10,"Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a derision unto him: he derideth every strong hold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it."
Habakkuk,1,11,"Then shall he sweep by as a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty: even he whose might is his god. Habakkuk’s Second Complaint (Psalm 11:1–7)"
Habakkuk,1,12,"Art not thou from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast established him for correction."
Habakkuk,1,13,"Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he; 14and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?"
Habakkuk,1,15,"He taketh up all of them with the angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad."
Habakkuk,1,16,"Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his meat plenteous."
Habakkuk,1,17,"Shall he therefore empty his net, and not spare to slay the nations continually?"
Habakkuk,2,1,"I WILL stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look forth to see what he will speak with me, and what I shall answer concerning my complaint."
Habakkuk,2,2,"And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it."
Habakkuk,2,3,"For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hasteth toward the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay."
Habakkuk,2,4,"Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith."
Habakkuk,2,5,"Yea, moreover, wine is a treacherous dealer, a haughty man, and that keepeth not at home; who enlargeth his desire as hell, and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples. Woe to the Chaldeans"
Habakkuk,2,6,"Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges!"
Habakkuk,2,7,"Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?"
Habakkuk,2,8,"Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall spoil thee; because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein."
Habakkuk,2,9,"Woe to him that getteth an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!"
Habakkuk,2,10,"Thou hast consulted shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast sinned against thy soul."
Habakkuk,2,11,"For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it."
Habakkuk,2,12,"Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!"
Habakkuk,2,13,"Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the peoples labour for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?"
Habakkuk,2,14,"For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea."
Habakkuk,2,15,"Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that addest thy venom thereto, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!"
Habakkuk,2,16,"Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised: the cup of the LORD’S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory."
Habakkuk,2,17,"For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein."
Habakkuk,2,18,"What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and the teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?"
Habakkuk,2,19,"Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it."
Habakkuk,2,20,But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.
Habakkuk,3,1,"A PRAYER of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth."
Habakkuk,3,2,"O LORD, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make it known; in wrath remember mercy."
Habakkuk,3,3,"God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise."
Habakkuk,3,4,And his brightness was as the light; he had rays coming forth from his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.
Habakkuk,3,5,"Before him went the pestilence, and fiery bolts went forth at his feet."
Habakkuk,3,6,"He stood, and measured the earth; he beheld, and drove asunder the nations: and the eternal mountains were scattered, the everlasting hills did bow; his goings were as of old."
Habakkuk,3,7,I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
Habakkuk,3,8,"Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers, or thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses, upon thy chariots of salvation?"
Habakkuk,3,9,Thy bow was made quite bare; the oaths to the tribes were a sure word. Selah Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
Habakkuk,3,10,"The mountains saw thee, and were afraid; the tempest of waters passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high."
Habakkuk,3,11,"The sun and moon stood still in their habitation; at the light of thine arrows as they went, at the shining of thy glittering spear."
Habakkuk,3,12,"Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the nations in anger."
Habakkuk,3,13,"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, for the salvation of thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, laying bare the foundation even unto the neck. Selah"
Habakkuk,3,14,Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors: they came as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.
Habakkuk,3,15,"Thou didst tread the sea with thine horses, the heap of mighty waters."
Habakkuk,3,16,"I heard, and my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice; rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my place: that I should rest in the day of trouble, when it cometh up against the people which invadeth him in troops. Habakkuk Rejoices"
Habakkuk,3,17,"For though the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:"
Habakkuk,3,18,"Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation."
Habakkuk,3,19,"Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength, and he maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and will make me to walk upon mine high places. For the Chief Musician, on my stringed instruments."
Zephaniah,1,1,"The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah."
Zephaniah,1,2,"I will utterly consume all things from off the face of the ground, saith the LORD."
Zephaniah,1,3,"I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the face of the ground, saith the LORD."
Zephaniah,1,4,"And I will stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarim with the priests; 5and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship, which swear to the LORD and swear by Malcam; 6and them that are turned back from following the LORD; and those that have not sought the LORD, nor inquired after him. The Day of the LORD (Malachi 4:1–6; 1 Thessalonians 5:1–11; 2 Peter 3:8–13)"
Zephaniah,1,7,"Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath sanctified his guests."
Zephaniah,1,8,"And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD’S sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king’s sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel."
Zephaniah,1,9,"And in that day I will punish all those that leap over the threshold, which fill their master’s house with violence and deceit."
Zephaniah,1,10,"And in that day, saith the LORD, there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills."
Zephaniah,1,11,"Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan are undone: all they that were laden with sliver are cut off."
Zephaniah,1,12,"And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles; and I will punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil."
Zephaniah,1,13,"And their wealth shall become a spoil, and their houses a desolation: yea, they shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine thereof."
Zephaniah,1,14,"The great day of the LORD is near, it is near and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD; the mighty man crieth there bitterly."
Zephaniah,1,15,"That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, 16a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fenced cities, and against the high battlements."
Zephaniah,1,17,"And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung."
Zephaniah,1,18,"Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD’S wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make an end, yea, a terrible end, of all them that dwell in the land."
Zephaniah,2,1,"Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation that hath no shame; 2before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD’S anger come upon you."
Zephaniah,2,3,"Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD’S anger. Judgment on the Philistines (Jeremiah 47:1–7)"
Zephaniah,2,4,"For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up."
Zephaniah,2,5,"Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant."
Zephaniah,2,6,"And the sea coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks."
Zephaniah,2,7,"And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed their flocks thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for the LORD their God shall visit them, and bring again their captivity. Judgment on Moab and Ammon (Isaiah 16:1–14; Jeremiah 48:1–47)"
Zephaniah,2,8,"I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border."
Zephaniah,2,9,"Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them."
Zephaniah,2,10,"This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against"

Zephaniah,2,12,"Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword."
Zephaniah,2,13,"And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness."
Zephaniah,2,14,"And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the chapiters thereof: their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he hath laid bare the cedar work."
Zephaniah,2,15,"This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none else beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted, to the oppressing city!"
Zephaniah,3,2,She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.
Zephaniah,3,3,Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the morrow.
Zephaniah,3,4,"Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law."
Zephaniah,3,5,"The LORD in the midst of her is righteous; he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame. Purification of the Nations"
Zephaniah,3,6,"I have cut off nations, their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant."
Zephaniah,3,7,"I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive correction; so her dwelling should not be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings."
Zephaniah,3,8,"Therefore wait ye for me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. A Faithful Remnant"
Zephaniah,3,9,"For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent."
Zephaniah,3,10,"From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering."
Zephaniah,3,11,"In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain."
Zephaniah,3,12,"But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD."
Zephaniah,3,13,"The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid. Israel’s Restoration"
Zephaniah,3,14,"Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem."
Zephaniah,3,15,"The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not fear evil any more."
Zephaniah,3,16,"In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: O Zion, let not thine hands be slack."
Zephaniah,3,17,"The LORD thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save: he will rejoice over thee with joy, he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing."
Zephaniah,3,18,"I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assembly, who were of thee: to whom the burden upon her was a reproach."
Zephaniah,3,19,"Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth."
Zephaniah,3,20,"At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring again your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD."

Haggai,1,6,"Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes."
Haggai,1,7,Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.
Haggai,1,8,"Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and"

Haggai,1,14,"And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, 15in the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king."

Acts,28,27,"For this people’s heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them."

Romans,1,18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold down the truth in unrighteousness; 19because that which may be known of God is manifest"
Romans,1,20,"For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse: 21because that, knowing God, they glorified him not as God, neither gave thanks; but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened."
Romans,1,22,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 23and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things."
Romans,1,24,"Wherefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonoured among themselves: 25for that they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen."
Romans,1,26,"For this cause God gave them up unto vile passions: for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature: 27and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due."
Romans,1,28,"And even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting; 29being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 30backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful: 32who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they which practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them."
Romans,2,1,"Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest"

Romans,2,4,"Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? 5but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; 6who will render to every man according to his works: 7to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life: 8but unto them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, shall be wrath and indignation, 9tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek; 10but glory and honour and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek: 11for there is no respect of persons with God."
Romans,2,12,"For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by law; 13for not the hearers of a law are just before God, but the doers of a law shall be justified: 14for when Gentiles which have no law do by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law unto themselves; 15in that they shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing them; 16in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ. The Jews and the Law"
Romans,2,17,"But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God, 18and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law, 19and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness, 20a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth; 21thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? 22thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples? 23thou who gloriest in the law, through thy transgression of"

Romans,2,26,"If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision? 27and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor"
Romans,2,28,"For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 29but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God."
Romans,3,1,What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision?
Romans,3,2,Much every way: first of
Romans,3,3,For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God?
Romans,3,4,"God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment."

There Is No One Righteous (Psalm 14:1–7; Psalm 53:1–6; Isaiah 59:1–17)"
Romans,3,9,"What then? are we in worse case than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin; 10as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one;"
Romans,3,11,"There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God;"
Romans,3,12,"They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not so much as one:"
Romans,3,13,Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips:

Romans,3,16,Destruction and misery are in their ways;

Romans,3,18,There is no fear of God before their eyes.
Romans,3,19,"Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God: 20because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for through the law cometh the knowledge of sin. Righteousness through Faith in Christ (Philippians 3:1–11)"
Romans,3,21,"But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 22even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction; 23for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God; 24being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 25whom God set forth to be a propitiation, through faith, by his blood, to shew his righteousness, because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God; 26for the shewing, I say, of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus."
Romans,3,27,Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of
Romans,3,28,We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
Romans,3,29,"Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also: 30if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith."
Romans,3,31,"Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law."

Romans,4,8,Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not reckon sin.
Romans,4,9,"Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say,"
Romans,4,10,"How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision: 11and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them; 12and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision. Abraham Receives the Promise (Genesis 15:8–21)"
Romans,4,13,"For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed, that he should be heir of the"

Romans,4,16,"For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace; to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all 17(as it is written, A father of many nations have I made thee) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth the things that are not,"
Romans,4,18,"Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father"
Romans,4,19,"And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb: 20yea, looking unto the promise of God, he wavered not through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to God, 21and being fully assured that,"
Romans,4,22,Wherefore also it was reckoned unto him for
Romans,4,23,"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was reckoned unto him; 24but for our sake also, unto whom it shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, 25who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification."
Romans,5,1,"Being therefore justified by faith, let us have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; 2through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand; and let us rejoice in hope"
Romans,5,3,"And not only so, but let us also rejoice in our tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; 4and patience, probation; and probation, hope: 5and hope putteth not to shame; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Ghost which was given unto us. Christ’s Sacrifice for the Ungodly (John 3:1–21)"
Romans,5,6,"For while we were yet weak, in due season Christ died for the ungodly."
Romans,5,7,For scarcely for a righteous
Romans,5,8,But God
Romans,5,9,"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath of God through him."
Romans,5,10,"For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life; 11and not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. Death in Adam, Life in Christ (Genesis 3:1–7)"
Romans,5,12,"Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned:— 13for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed"
Romans,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is a figure of him that was to come."
Romans,5,15,"But not as the trespass, so also is the free gift. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound unto the"
Romans,5,16,"And not as through one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment came of one unto"
Romans,5,17,"For if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, even Jesus Christ."
Romans,5,18,So then as through one trespass the judgment came unto all men to condemnation; even so through
Romans,5,19,"For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall"
Romans,5,20,"And the law came in beside, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly: 21that, as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans,6,1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
Romans,6,2,God forbid. We who died
Romans,6,3,Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into

Romans,6,5,"For if we have become united with him by the likeness of his death, we shall be also by the likeness of his resurrection; 6knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin; 7for he that hath died is justified from sin."
Romans,6,8,"But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him; 9knowing that Christ being"
Romans,6,10,For the death that he
Romans,6,11,"Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus."
Romans,6,12,"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof: 13neither present your members unto sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God,"
Romans,6,14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace. The Wages of Sin"
Romans,6,15,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid."
Romans,6,16,"Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves as servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye"
Romans,6,17,"But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered; 18and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness."
Romans,6,19,"I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness unto sanctification."
Romans,6,20,"For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness."
Romans,6,21,What fruit then had ye
Romans,6,22,"But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and"
Romans,6,23,For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans,7,1,"Or are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to men that know the law), how that the law hath dominion"
Romans,7,2,For the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the
Romans,7,3,"So then if, while the husband liveth, she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to another man."
Romans,7,4,"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit"
Romans,7,5,"For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought"
Romans,7,6,"But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were holden; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter. God’s Law Is Holy"
Romans,7,7,"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet: 8but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin"
Romans,7,9,"And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died; 10and the commandment, which was unto life, this I found to be unto death: 11for sin, finding"
Romans,7,12,"So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good. Struggling with Sin"
Romans,7,13,"Did then that which is good become death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shewn to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good;—that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful."
Romans,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."
Romans,7,15,For that which I do I know
Romans,7,16,"But if what I would not, that"
Romans,7,17,"So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth"
Romans,7,18,"For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with"
Romans,7,19,For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I
Romans,7,20,"But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me."
Romans,7,21,"I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present."
Romans,7,22,"For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 23but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,"
Romans,7,24,O wretched man that I
Romans,7,25,I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I myself with the mind serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
Romans,8,1,There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
Romans,8,2,For the law of the Spirit
Romans,8,3,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: 4that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us,"
Romans,8,5,For they that are after the flesh do mind the things
Romans,8,6,"For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the spirit is life and peace: 7because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be: 8and they that are in the flesh cannot please God."
Romans,8,9,"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any"

Romans,8,25,"But if we hope for that which we see not, then do we with patience wait for it."
Romans,8,26,"And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered; 27and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. God Works in All Things (Ephesians 1:3–14)"
Romans,8,28,"And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good, even to them that are"
Romans,8,29,"For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren: 30and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
Romans,8,31,"What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?"
Romans,8,32,He that spared not his
Romans,8,33,"Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth; 34who is he that shall condemn? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. More than Conquerors (Psalm 44:1–26)"
Romans,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
Romans,8,36,"Even as it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
Romans,8,37,"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."
Romans,8,38,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, 39nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans,9,1,"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Ghost, 2that I"
Romans,9,3,"For I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren’s sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh: 4who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; 5whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. God’s Sovereign Choice (Genesis 25:19–28; Malachi 1:1–5)"

The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach: 9because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved: 10for with the heart man"
Romans,10,11,For the scripture
Romans,10,12,"For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich unto all that call upon him: 13for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
Romans,10,14,"How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 15and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things!"
Romans,10,16,"But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?"
Romans,10,17,"So belief cometh of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ."
Romans,10,18,"But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, verily, Their sound went out into all the earth, And their words unto the ends of the world."
Romans,10,19,"But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, With a nation void of understanding will I anger you."
Romans,10,20,"And Isaiah is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I became manifest unto them that asked not of me."
Romans,10,21,"But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people."

Romans,11,6,"But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace."
Romans,11,7,"What then? That which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened: 8according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day."

Romans,11,25,"For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; 26and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:"

Romans,11,28,"As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved"
Romans,11,29,For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.
Romans,11,30,"For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience, 31even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shewn to you they also may now obtain mercy."

Romans,14,18,"For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men."
Romans,14,19,So then let us
Romans,14,20,Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who

Romans,14,22,"The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that"
Romans,14,23,"But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin."

Romans,15,7,"Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God."
Romans,15,8,"For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given unto the fathers, 9and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name."
Romans,15,10,"And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people."
Romans,15,11,"And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him."
Romans,15,12,"And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope."
Romans,15,13,"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Ghost. Paul the Minister to the Gentiles"
Romans,15,14,"And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled"
Romans,15,15,"But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God, 16that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering"
Romans,15,17,I have therefore
Romans,15,18,"For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed, 19in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ; 20yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build upon another man’s foundation; 21but, as it is written, They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, And they who have not heard shall understand."
Romans,15,22,"Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you: Paul’s Travel Plans (1 Corinthians 16:5–9) 23but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you, 24whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)—"

Romans,15,30,"Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; 31that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and that my ministration which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints; 32that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest."
Romans,15,33,Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
Romans,16,1,"I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church that is at Cenchreae: 2that ye receive her in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever matter she may have need of you: for she herself also hath been a succourer of many, and of mine own self."

Romans,16,18,"For they that are such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts"

Romans,16,22,"I Tertius, who write the epistle, salute you in the Lord."
Romans,16,23,"Gaius my host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth you, and Quartus the brother. 24 Doxology (Jude 1:24–25)"
Romans,16,25,"Now to him that is able to stablish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal, 26but now is manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known unto all the nations unto obedience of faith; 27to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory for ever. Amen."
1 Corinthians,1,1,"Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, 2unto the church of God which is at Corinth, even them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their Lord and ours:"
1 Corinthians,1,3,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Thanksgiving (Philippians 1:3–11; Colossians 1:3–14)
1 Corinthians,1,4,"I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus; 5that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge; 6even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: 7so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; 8who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye be unreproveable in the day of"

1 Corinthians,1,16,"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized"
1 Corinthians,1,17,"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void. The Message of the Cross"
1 Corinthians,1,18,For the word of the cross is to them that are perishing foolishness; but unto us which are being saved it is the power of God.
1 Corinthians,1,19,"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And the prudence of the prudent will I reject."
1 Corinthians,1,20,Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made

1 Corinthians,1,22,"Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom: 23but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness; 24but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
1 Corinthians,1,25,Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. Wisdom from God
1 Corinthians,1,26,"For behold your calling, brethren, how that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: 27but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong; 28and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, yea and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are: 29that no flesh"
1 Corinthians,1,30,"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption: 31that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,2,1,"And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming"

1 Corinthians,2,3,"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."
1 Corinthians,2,4,"And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: 5that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Spiritual Wisdom (Ephesians 1:15–23)"
1 Corinthians,2,6,"Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, which are coming to nought: 7but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, even the wisdom that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory: 8which none of the rulers of this world knoweth: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory: 9but as it is written, Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, And which entered not into the heart of man, Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him."
1 Corinthians,2,10,"But unto us God revealed them through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep"
1 Corinthians,2,11,"For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which"
1 Corinthians,2,12,"But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given"
1 Corinthians,2,13,"Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
1 Corinthians,2,14,Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him;
1 Corinthians,2,15,But he that is spiritual judgeth all
1 Corinthians,2,16,"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,1,"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in"
1 Corinthians,3,2,"I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able to bear it: nay, not even now are ye able; 3for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal,"
1 Corinthians,3,4,"For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?"
1 Corinthians,3,5,What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord

1 Corinthians,3,7,So then neither is he that

1 Corinthians,3,10,"According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation;"

1 Corinthians,3,12,"But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble; 13each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each"
1 Corinthians,3,14,"If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive"
1 Corinthians,3,15,"If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire. God’s Temple and God’s Wisdom (Romans 12:1–8; 1 Corinthians 6:18–20)"
1 Corinthians,3,16,"Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"
1 Corinthians,3,17,"If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are."
1 Corinthians,3,18,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise."
1 Corinthians,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their"
1 Corinthians,3,21,"Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours; 22whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 23and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s."
1 Corinthians,4,1,"Let a man so account of us, as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God."
1 Corinthians,4,2,"Here,"
1 Corinthians,4,3,But with me it is a very small thing
1 Corinthians,4,4,For I know
1 Corinthians,4,5,"Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from God."
1 Corinthians,4,6,"Now these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye might learn not to go beyond the things which are written; that no one of you be puffed up"
1 Corinthians,4,7,"For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?"
1 Corinthians,4,8,"Already are ye filled, already ye are become rich, ye have reigned without us: yea and I would that"
1 Corinthians,4,9,"For, I think, God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men."
1 Corinthians,4,10,"We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have"
1 Corinthians,4,11,"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place; 12and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure; 13being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now. Paul’s Fatherly Warning"
1 Corinthians,4,14,"I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children."
1 Corinthians,4,15,"For though ye should have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I begat"
1 Corinthians,4,16,"I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me."
1 Corinthians,4,17,"For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance"
1 Corinthians,4,18,Now some are puffed

1 Corinthians,4,20,For the kingdom of God is not in

1 Corinthians,5,1,"It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among"
1 Corinthians,5,2,"And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you."
1 Corinthians,5,3,"For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him that hath so wrought this thing, 4in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 5to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
1 Corinthians,5,6,Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
1 Corinthians,5,7,"Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ: 8wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Expel the Immoral Brother"
1 Corinthians,5,9,"I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators; 10not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world: 11but now I write unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with"
1 Corinthians,5,12,"For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within, 13whereas them that are without God judgeth? Put away the wicked man from among yourselves."
1 Corinthians,6,1,"Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbour, go to law before the unrighteous, and not"
1 Corinthians,6,2,Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by
1 Corinthians,6,3,Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how
1 Corinthians,6,4,"If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do"
1 Corinthians,6,5,"I say this to move you to shame. Is it so, that there cannot be found among you one wise man, who shall be able to decide between his brethren, 6but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?"
1 Corinthians,6,7,"Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather"
1 Corinthians,6,8,"Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. Members of Christ"
1 Corinthians,6,9,"Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, 10nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."
1 Corinthians,6,11,"And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God."
1 Corinthians,6,12,All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will

1 Corinthians,6,15,"Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them"
1 Corinthians,6,16,"Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for,"
1 Corinthians,6,17,But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. The Temple of the Holy Spirit (Romans 12:1–8; 1 Corinthians 3:16–23)
1 Corinthians,6,18,Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication
1 Corinthians,6,19,"Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own; 20for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body."
1 Corinthians,7,1,Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
1 Corinthians,7,2,"But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband."
1 Corinthians,7,3,Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
1 Corinthians,7,4,"The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power"
1 Corinthians,7,5,"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because"
1 Corinthians,7,6,"But this I say by way of permission, not of commandment."
1 Corinthians,7,7,"Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that."
1 Corinthians,7,8,"But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I."
1 Corinthians,7,9,"But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"But unto the married I give charge, yea not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband 11(but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife."
1 Corinthians,7,12,"But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to"
1 Corinthians,7,13,"And the woman which hath an unbelieving husband, and he is"
1 Corinthians,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but"
1 Corinthians,7,15,"Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not"
1 Corinthians,7,16,"For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife? Live Your Calling"
1 Corinthians,7,17,"Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so"
1 Corinthians,7,18,Was any man called being circumcised? let him not become
1 Corinthians,7,19,Circumcision is
1 Corinthians,7,20,Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.
1 Corinthians,7,21,"Wast thou called being a bondservant? care not for it: but if thou canst become free, use it rather."
1 Corinthians,7,22,"For he that was called in the Lord, being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman: likewise he that was"
1 Corinthians,7,23,Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of
1 Corinthians,7,24,"Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God. The Unmarried and Widowed"
1 Corinthians,7,25,"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that"
1 Corinthians,7,26,I think therefore that this is good by reason of the
1 Corinthians,7,27,Art thou bound unto a wife? seek
1 Corinthians,7,28,"But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I"
1 Corinthians,7,29,"But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none; 30and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not; 31and those that use the world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away."
1 Corinthians,7,32,"But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord: 33but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he"
1 Corinthians,7,34,"And there is a difference also between the wife and the virgin. She that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she"
1 Corinthians,7,35,"And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin daughter, if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry."
1 Corinthians,7,37,"But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching his own"
1 Corinthians,7,38,So then both he that giveth his own virgin daughter in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.
1 Corinthians,7,39,"A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be"
1 Corinthians,7,40,"But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God."
1 Corinthians,8,1,Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth
1 Corinthians,8,2,"If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know; 3but if any man loveth God, the same is known of him."
1 Corinthians,8,4,"Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the"
1 Corinthians,8,5,"For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many; 6yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him."
1 Corinthians,8,7,"Howbeit in all men there is not that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as of"
1 Corinthians,8,8,But meat will not commend
1 Corinthians,8,9,But take heed
1 Corinthians,8,10,"For if a man see thee which hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be"
1 Corinthians,8,11,"For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth,"
1 Corinthians,8,12,"And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their"
1 Corinthians,8,13,"Wherefore, if meat maketh my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I make not my brother to stumble."
1 Corinthians,9,1,Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?
1 Corinthians,9,2,"If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,9,3,My defence to them that examine me is this.
1 Corinthians,9,4,Have we no right to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians,9,5,"Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the"
1 Corinthians,9,6,"Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?"

1 Corinthians,12,7,But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.
1 Corinthians,12,8,"For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit: 9to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit; 10and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits: to another divers kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues: 11but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will. The Body of Christ"
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are"
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am"

1 Corinthians,12,20,"But now they are many members, but one body."
1 Corinthians,12,21,And the eye cannot say to
1 Corinthians,12,22,"Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary: 23and those parts of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness; 24whereas our comely parts have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honour to that part which lacked; 25that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another."
1 Corinthians,12,26,"And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it. The Greater Gifts"
1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then"
1 Corinthians,12,29,Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? 30have all gifts of healings? do all speak with

1 Corinthians,13,3,"And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 5doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil; 6rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth; 7beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there be"
1 Corinthians,13,9,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part: 10but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done"
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am"

1 Corinthians,13,13,"But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth; but in the"
1 Corinthians,14,3,"But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and comfort,"
1 Corinthians,14,4,He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the
1 Corinthians,14,5,"Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how shall it"
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds"
1 Corinthians,14,11,"If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me."
1 Corinthians,14,12,"So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church."
1 Corinthians,14,13,Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray in a tongue,"
1 Corinthians,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding"
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the"
1 Corinthians,14,17,For thou verily givest thanks
1 Corinthians,14,18,"I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all: 19howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brethren, be not children in mind: howbeit in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men."
1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and"
1 Corinthians,14,22,"Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that"
1 Corinthians,14,23,"If therefore the whole church be assembled together, and all speak with tongues, and there"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all; 25the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed. Orderly Worship"
1 Corinthians,14,26,"What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a"
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If any man speaketh in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and that in turn; and let one interpret: 28but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and"

1 Corinthians,14,30,But if a revelation
1 Corinthians,14,31,"For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted; 32and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets; 33for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace; as in all the churches of the saints."
1 Corinthians,14,34,Let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them
1 Corinthians,14,35,"And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own"
1 Corinthians,14,36,What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone?
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which"
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues."
1 Corinthians,14,40,But let all things be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand, 2by which also ye are saved; I make known, I say, in what words I preached it unto you, if ye hold it fast, except ye believed in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures; 5and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve; 6then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep; 7then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles; 8and last of all, as unto one born"
1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be"
1 Corinthians,15,10,But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I laboured more abundantly than
1 Corinthians,15,11,"Whether then it be I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed. The Resurrection of the Dead"
1 Corinthians,15,12,"Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised: 14and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain."
1 Corinthians,15,15,"Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ:"
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised: 17and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins."
1 Corinthians,15,18,Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable. The Order of Resurrection"
1 Corinthians,15,20,"But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep."
1 Corinthians,15,21,For since
1 Corinthians,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, so also"
1 Corinthians,15,23,But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are

1 Corinthians,15,25,"For he must reign, till"
1 Corinthians,15,26,The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.
1 Corinthians,15,27,"For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is"
1 Corinthians,15,28,"And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then"
1 Corinthians,15,30,Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?
1 Corinthians,15,31,I protest by that glorying
1 Corinthians,15,32,"If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink,"
1 Corinthians,15,33,Be not deceived: Evil company doth corrupt good manners.
1 Corinthians,15,34,"Awake up righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak this to move you to shame. The Resurrection Body"
1 Corinthians,15,35,"But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come?"
1 Corinthians,15,36,"Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened, except it die: 37and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind; 38but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its"

1 Corinthians,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory."
1 Corinthians,15,42,So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 43it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: 44it is sown a

1 Corinthians,15,55,"O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?"
1 Corinthians,15,56,"The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law: 57but thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,15,58,"Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not vain in the Lord."

2 Corinthians,1,8,"For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life: 9yea, we ourselves have had the answer of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: 10who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us; 11ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf. Paul’s Change of Plans"
2 Corinthians,1,12,"For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to"
2 Corinthians,1,13,"For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge, and I hope ye will acknowledge unto the end: 14as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that we are your glorying, even as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus."
2 Corinthians,1,15,"And in this confidence I was minded to come before unto you, that ye might have a second benefit; 16and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and of you to be"
2 Corinthians,1,17,"When I therefore was thus minded, did I shew fickleness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yea"
2 Corinthians,1,18,"But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yea and nay."
2 Corinthians,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was"
2 Corinthians,1,20,"For how many soever be the promises of God, in him is the yea:"
2 Corinthians,1,21,"Now he that stablisheth us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God; 22who also sealed us, and gave us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
2 Corinthians,1,23,"But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I forbare to come unto Corinth."
2 Corinthians,1,24,"Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand."
2 Corinthians,2,1,"But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow."
2 Corinthians,2,2,For if I make you

2 Corinthians,2,4,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you."
2 Corinthians,2,5,"But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too"
2 Corinthians,2,6,"Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many; 7so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should"
2 Corinthians,2,8,Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love toward

2 Corinthians,2,10,"But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the person of Christ; 11that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices. Triumph in Christ"
2 Corinthians,2,12,"Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the"
2 Corinthians,2,13,"I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia."
2 Corinthians,2,14,"But thanks be unto God, which always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through"
2 Corinthians,2,15,"For we are a sweet savour of Christ unto God, in them that are being saved, and in them that are perishing; 16to the one a savour from death unto death; to"
2 Corinthians,2,17,"For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ."
2 Corinthians,3,1,"Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation"
2 Corinthians,3,2,"Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men; 3being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables that are hearts of flesh."
2 Corinthians,3,4,"And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward: 5not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God; 6who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. The Glory of the New Covenant (Exodus 34:10–35)"
2 Corinthians,3,7,"But if the ministration of death, written, and engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which glory was"
2 Corinthians,3,9,For if the ministration

2 Corinthians,3,11,"For if that which passeth away was with glory, much more that which remaineth is in glory."
2 Corinthians,3,12,"Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech, 13and are not as Moses, who put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away: 14but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old"
2 Corinthians,3,15,"But unto this day,"
2 Corinthians,3,16,"But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the"
2 Corinthians,3,17,"Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
2 Corinthians,3,18,"But we all, with unveiled face reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit."
2 Corinthians,4,1,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we faint not: 2but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in"
2 Corinthians,4,3,"But and if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that are perishing: 4in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the gospel of the glory of"

2 Corinthians,4,6,"Seeing it is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. Treasure in Jars of Clay (Romans 6:1–14)"
2 Corinthians,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves; 8we are pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not unto despair; 9pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed; 10always bearing about in"
2 Corinthians,4,11,"For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our"
2 Corinthians,4,12,"So then death worketh in us, but life in you."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore did I speak; we also believe, and therefore also we speak; 14knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus"
2 Corinthians,4,15,"For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound unto the glory of God."
2 Corinthians,4,16,"Wherefore we faint not; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed"
2 Corinthians,4,17,"For our light affliction, which is for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory; 18while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a"
2 Corinthians,5,2,"For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven: 3if so be that being clothed we shall not be found"
2 Corinthians,5,4,"For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be"
2 Corinthians,5,5,"Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit."
2 Corinthians,5,6,"Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord 7(for we walk by faith, not by sight); 8we are of good courage, I say, and"
2 Corinthians,5,9,Wherefore also we

2 Corinthians,5,11,"Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and"
2 Corinthians,5,12,"We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but speak as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to"
2 Corinthians,5,13,"For whether we are beside ourselves, it is"
2 Corinthians,5,14,"For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died; 15and he died for all, that they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again."
2 Corinthians,5,16,Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the

2 Corinthians,5,18,"But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation; 19to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech"
2 Corinthians,5,21,Him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him.
2 Corinthians,6,1,"And working together with him we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain 2(for he saith, At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee, And in a day of salvation did I succour thee: behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation): 3giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed; 4but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 5in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; 6in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Ghost, in love unfeigned, 7in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 8by glory and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; 9as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; 10as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."
2 Corinthians,6,11,"Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged."
2 Corinthians,6,12,"Ye are not straitened in us, but"
2 Corinthians,6,13,"Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as unto my children), be ye also enlarged. Do Not Be Unequally Yoked"
2 Corinthians,6,14,Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or
2 Corinthians,6,15,And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever?
2 Corinthians,6,16,"And what agreement hath a temple of God with idols? for we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
2 Corinthians,6,17,"Wherefore Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, And touch no unclean thing; And I will receive you,"
2 Corinthians,6,18,"And will be to you a Father, And ye shall be to me sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."
2 Corinthians,7,1,"Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
2 Corinthians,7,2,"Open your hearts to us: we wronged no man, we corrupted no man, we took advantage of no man."
2 Corinthians,7,3,"I say it not to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die together and live"
2 Corinthians,7,4,"Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying on your behalf: I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction."
2 Corinthians,7,5,"For even when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every"
2 Corinthians,7,6,"Nevertheless he that comforteth the lowly, even God, comforted us by the coming of Titus; 7and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted in you, while he told us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I"
2 Corinthians,7,8,"For though I made you sorry with my epistle, I do not regret it, though I did regret;"
2 Corinthians,7,9,"Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye were made sorry unto repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly sort,"
2 Corinthians,7,10,"For godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation, a"
2 Corinthians,7,11,"For behold, this selfsame thing, that ye were made sorry after a godly sort, what earnest care it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what longing, yea, what zeal,"
2 Corinthians,7,12,"So although I wrote unto you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong,"
2 Corinthians,7,13,"Therefore we have been comforted: and in our comfort we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus,"
2 Corinthians,7,14,"For if in anything I have gloried to him on your behalf, I was not put to shame; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so our glorying also, which"
2 Corinthians,7,15,"And his inward affection is more abundantly toward you,"
2 Corinthians,7,16,I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.
2 Corinthians,8,1,"Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia; 2how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty"
2 Corinthians,8,3,"For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord, 4beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints: 5and this, not as we had hoped, but first"
2 Corinthians,8,6,"Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he had made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also."
2 Corinthians,8,7,"But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all earnestness, and"
2 Corinthians,8,8,"I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love."
2 Corinthians,8,9,"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became"
2 Corinthians,8,10,"And herein I give my judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will."
2 Corinthians,8,11,"But now complete the doing also; that as there was the readiness to will, so there may be the"
2 Corinthians,8,12,"For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according as a man"
2 Corinthians,8,13,"For I say not this, that others may be eased, and ye distressed: 14but by equality; your abundance being a supply at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become a supply for your want; that there may be equality: 15as it is written, He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that gathered little had no lack. Titus Commended (Titus 1:1–4)"
2 Corinthians,8,16,"But thanks be to God, which putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus."
2 Corinthians,8,17,"For indeed he accepted our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own"
2 Corinthians,8,18,"And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is spread through all the churches; 19and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in the matter of this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and to shew our readiness:"
2 Corinthians,8,20,"Avoiding this, that any man should blame us in the matter of this bounty which is ministered by us: 21for we take thought for things honourable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of"
2 Corinthians,8,22,"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many"
2 Corinthians,8,23,"Whether any inquire about Titus, he is my partner and my fellow-worker to you-ward; or our brethren, they are"
2 Corinthians,8,24,"Shew ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf."
2 Corinthians,9,1,"For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: 2for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been prepared for"
2 Corinthians,9,3,"But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, ye may be prepared: 4lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia, and find you unprepared, we (that we"
2 Corinthians,9,5,"I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion."

2 Corinthians,9,8,"And God is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work: 9as it is written, He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor; His righteousness abideth for ever."
2 Corinthians,9,10,"And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness: 11ye being enriched in everything unto all"
2 Corinthians,9,12,"For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto God; 13seeing that through the proving of you by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution unto them and unto all; 14while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of"
2 Corinthians,9,15,Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.
2 Corinthians,10,1,"Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you: 2yea, I beseech you, that I may not when present shew courage with the confidence wherewith I count to be bold against some, which"
2 Corinthians,10,3,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh 4(for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the casting down of strong holds); 5casting down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ; 6and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be fulfilled."
2 Corinthians,10,7,"Ye look at the things that are before your face. If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ’s, let"

2 Corinthians,10,11,"Let such a one reckon this, that, what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present."
2 Corinthians,10,12,"For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves: but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with"
2 Corinthians,10,13,"But we will not glory beyond our measure, but according to"
2 Corinthians,10,14,"For we stretch not ourselves overmuch, as though we reached not unto you: for we came even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ: 15not glorying beyond our measure, that is, in other men’s labours; but having hope that, as your faith groweth, we shall be magnified in you according to our province unto further abundance, 16so as to preach the gospel even unto the parts beyond you, and not to glory"
2 Corinthians,10,17,"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the"
2 Corinthians,10,18,"For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth."
2 Corinthians,11,1,Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: nay indeed bear with me.

Galatians,1,15,"But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, even from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace, 16to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: 17neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus."
Galatians,1,18,"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days."
Galatians,1,19,"But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother."

Galatians,2,6,"But from those who were reputed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth not man’s person)—they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me: 7but contrariwise, when they saw that I had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the gospel of the circumcision 8(for he that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the Gentiles); 9and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision; 10only they would that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do. Paul Confronts Cephas"
Galatians,2,11,"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned."
Galatians,2,12,"For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they came, he drew back"
Galatians,2,13,And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.

Galatians,4,29,"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now."
Galatians,4,30,Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.

Ephesians,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ: 4even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love: 5having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 6to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved: 7in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, 8which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 9having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him 10unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth; in him, I say, 11in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will; 12to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ: 13in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,—in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 14which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of God’s own possession, unto the praise of his glory. Spiritual Wisdom (1 Corinthians 2:6–16)"
Ephesians,1,15,"For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and which ye shew toward all the saints, 16cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; 17that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; 18having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, 19and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might 20which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places, 21far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: 22and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church, 23which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all."
Ephesians,2,1,"And you did he quicken, when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins, 2wherein aforetime ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience; 3among whom we also all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:— 4but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 5even when we were dead through our trespasses, quickened us together with Christ (by grace have ye been saved), 6and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus: 7that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus: 8for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:"

Ephesians,2,11,"Wherefore remember, that aforetime ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands; 12that ye were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the"

Christ Our Cornerstone (Isaiah 28:14–22; 1 Corinthians 3:10–15; 1 Peter 2:1–8)"
Ephesians,2,19,"So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God, 20being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone; 21in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord; 22in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit."
Ephesians,3,1,"For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,— 2if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward; 3how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote afore in few words, 4whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ; 5which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; 6to wit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow- partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, 7whereof I was made a minister, according"

Ephesians,3,20,"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 21unto him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen."

Ephesians,4,7,But unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Ephesians,4,8,"Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, And gave gifts unto men."
Ephesians,4,10,"He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)"
Ephesians,4,11,"And he gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the building up of the body of Christ: 13till we all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a fullgrown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 14that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error; 15but speaking truth in love, may grow up in all things into him, which is the head, even Christ; 16from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in due measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love. New Life in Christ (Colossians 3:1–17)"
Ephesians,4,17,"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind, 18being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart; 19who being past feeling"
Ephesians,4,20,"But ye did not so learn Christ; 21if so be that ye heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus: 22that ye put away, as concerning your former manner of life, the old man, which waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit; 23and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 24and put on the new man, which after God hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth."

Ephesians,5,24,"But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything."
Ephesians,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it; 26that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, 27that he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should"
Ephesians,5,28,"Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself: 29for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church; 30because we are members of his body."
Ephesians,5,31,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the twain"
Ephesians,5,32,This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.
Ephesians,5,33,Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.

Ephesians,6,5,"Servants, be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; 6not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 7with good will doing service, as unto the Lord, and not unto men: 8knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth, the same shall he receive again from the Lord, whether he be bond or free."
Ephesians,6,9,"And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, and forbear threatening: knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him. The Full Armor of God"
Ephesians,6,10,"Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might."
Ephesians,6,11,"Put on the whole armour of God,"
Ephesians,6,12,"For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness,"
Ephesians,6,13,Wherefore take up the whole armour

Ephesians,6,19,"And on my behalf, that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, 20for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. Final Greetings (Philippians 4:21–23; 2 Timothy 4:19–22)"
Ephesians,6,21,"But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: 22whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts."
Ephesians,6,23,"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."

Philippians,1,1,"Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with"
Philippians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Thanksgiving and Prayer (1 Corinthians 1:4–9; Colossians 1:3–14)
Philippians,1,3,"I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you, 4always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy, 5for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now; 6being confident of this very thing, that he which began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ: 7even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation"
Philippians,1,8,"For God is my witness, how I long after you all"
Philippians,1,9,"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment; 10so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ; 11being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. Paul’s Trials Advance the Gospel (James 1:2–12)"
Philippians,1,12,"Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel; 13so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest; 14and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident"
Philippians,1,15,"Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 16the one do it of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel: 17but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking"
Philippians,1,18,"What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or"
Philippians,1,19,"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 20according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death. To Live Is Christ"
Philippians,1,21,"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
Philippians,1,22,"But if to live in the flesh,—if this is the fruit of my"
Philippians,1,23,"But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better: 24yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your"
Philippians,1,25,"And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith; 26that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again. Worthy of the Gospel"
Philippians,1,27,"Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you or be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel; 28and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God; 29because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf: 30having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me."
Philippians,2,1,"If there is therefore any comfort in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions, 2fulfill ye my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind; 3doing nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself; 4not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others. The Mind of Christ (Isaiah 52:13–15)"
Philippians,2,5,"Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 6who, being in the form of God, counted it not a prize to be on an equality with God, 7but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; 8and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient"
Philippians,2,9,"Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name; 10that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, 11and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Lights in the World (Matthew 5:13–16)"
Philippians,2,12,"So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure."
Philippians,2,14,"Do all things without murmurings and disputings; 15that ye may be blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world, 16holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of"
Philippians,2,17,"Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all: 18and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me. Timothy and Epaphroditus (1 Corinthians 16:10–12)"
Philippians,2,19,"But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort,"
Philippians,2,20,"For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state."

Philippians,2,23,"Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me: 24but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly."
Philippians,2,25,"But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow- soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need; 26since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick: 27for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow."
Philippians,2,28,"I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that"
Philippians,2,29,"Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honour: 30because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me."
Philippians,3,1,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe."
Philippians,3,2,"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision: 3for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh: 4though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more: 5circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; 6as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless."
Philippians,3,7,"Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ."
Philippians,3,8,"Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may gain Christ, 9and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, even that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: 10that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death; 11if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead. Pressing on toward the Goal"
Philippians,3,12,"Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may"
Philippians,3,13,"Brethren, I count not myself yet to have apprehended: but one thing I do, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward"
Philippians,3,14,I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God
Philippians,3,15,"Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, even this shall God reveal unto you: 16only, whereunto we have already attained, by that same rule let us walk. Citizenship in Heaven"
Philippians,3,17,"Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them which so walk even as ye have us for an"
Philippians,3,18,"For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: 19whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and whose glory"
Philippians,3,20,"For our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: 21who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself."
Philippians,4,1,"Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved."
Philippians,4,2,"I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord."
Philippians,4,3,"Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life."

Colossians,1,3,"We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, 4having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have toward all the saints, 5because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel, 6which is come unto you; even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing, as it doth in you also, since the day ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth; 7even as ye learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf, 8who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit."
Colossians,1,9,"For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray and make request for you, that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, 10to walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; 11strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, unto all patience and longsuffering with joy; 12giving thanks unto the Father, who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; 13who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love; 14in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins: The Supremacy of the Son (Hebrews 1:1–14) 15who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; 16for in him were all things created, in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and unto him; 17and he is before"

Colossians,1,21,"And you, being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works, yet now hath he reconciled 22in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him: 23if so be that ye continue in the faith, grounded and stedfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; whereof I Paul was made a minister. Paul’s Suffering for the Church (2 Corinthians 11:16–33)"
Colossians,1,24,"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church; 25whereof I was made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which was given me to you-ward, to fulfill the word of God, 26even the mystery which hath been hid from all ages and generations: but now hath it been manifested to his saints, 27to whom God was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: 28whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ; 29whereunto I labour also, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily."

Colossians,2,13,"And you, being dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, you, I say, did he quicken together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses; 14having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he hath taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross; 15having put off from himself the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it."

1 Thessalonians,3,1,"Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone; 2and sent Timothy, our brother and God’s minister in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith; 3that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know"
1 Thessalonians,3,4,"For verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we"
1 Thessalonians,3,5,"For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labour should be in vain. Timothy’s Encouraging Report"
1 Thessalonians,3,6,"But when Timothy came even now unto us from you, and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also to see you; 7for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your"
1 Thessalonians,3,9,"For what thanksgiving can we render again unto God for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; 10night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
1 Thessalonians,3,11,"Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way unto you: 12and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you; 13to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints."

1 Thessalonians,4,9,"But concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another; 10for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that ye abound more and more; 11and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you; 12that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing. The Return of the Lord"
1 Thessalonians,4,13,"But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that ye sorrow not,"
1 Thessalonians,4,14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them"
1 Thessalonians,4,15,"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall in no wise precede"
1 Thessalonians,4,16,"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 17then we that are alive, that are left, shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in"
1 Thessalonians,4,18,Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
1 Thessalonians,5,1,"But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you."
1 Thessalonians,5,2,For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians,5,3,"When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman"

1 Thessalonians,5,26,Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians,5,27,I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.
1 Thessalonians,5,28,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
2 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord"
2 Thessalonians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians,1,3,"We are bound to give thanks to God alway for you, brethren, even as it is meet, for that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all toward one another aboundeth; 4so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which ye endure; Christ’s Coming 5which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God; to the end that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer: 6if so be that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to them that afflict you, 7and to you that are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power 8in flaming fire, rendering vengeance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus: 9who shall suffer punishment, even eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might, 10when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at in all them that believed"
2 Thessalonians,1,11,"To which end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and every work of faith, with power; 12that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,1,"Now we beseech you, brethren, touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him; 2to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of the Lord is now present; 3let no man beguile you in any wise: for it will not be, except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, 4he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God."
2 Thessalonians,2,5,"Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"
2 Thessalonians,2,6,And now ye know that
2 Thessalonians,2,7,"For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only there is one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the"
2 Thessalonians,2,8,"And then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming; 9even he, whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 10and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that are perishing; because they received not the love of the truth, that they"
2 Thessalonians,2,11,"And for this cause God sendeth them a working of error, that they should believe a lie: 12that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. Stand Firm"
2 Thessalonians,2,13,"But we are bound to give thanks to God alway for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: 14whereunto he called you through our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,15,"So then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye were taught, whether by word, or by epistle of ours."
2 Thessalonians,2,16,"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father which loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, 17comfort your hearts and stablish them in every good work and word."
2 Thessalonians,3,1,"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also it is"

2 Thessalonians,3,6,"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves"
2 Thessalonians,3,7,"For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you; 8neither did we eat bread for nought at any man’s hand, but in labour and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you: 9not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves"
2 Thessalonians,3,10,"For even when we were with you, this we"
2 Thessalonians,3,11,For we hear of some that walk among you
2 Thessalonians,3,12,Now them that are such we command and exhort
2 Thessalonians,3,13,"But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing."
2 Thessalonians,3,14,"And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with"
2 Thessalonians,3,15,"And yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. Signature and Final Greetings (1 Corinthians 16:19–24; Colossians 4:15–18)"

1 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope; 2unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Correcting False Teachers (Titus 1:10–16)"
1 Timothy,1,3,"As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine, 4neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies,"
1 Timothy,1,5,"But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned: 6from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking; 7desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm."
1 Timothy,1,8,"But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully, 9as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 10for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine; 11according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust. God’s Grace to Paul"
1 Timothy,1,12,"I thank him that enabled me, even Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to his service; 13though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief; 14and the grace of our Lord abounded"
1 Timothy,1,15,"Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief: 16howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ shew forth all his longsuffering, for"
1 Timothy,1,17,"Now unto the King eternal, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen."
1 Timothy,1,18,"This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that by them thou mayest war the good warfare; 19holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith: 20of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered unto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme."
1 Timothy,2,1,"I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men; 2for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all"
1 Timothy,2,3,This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 4who willeth that
1 Timothy,2,5,"For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus, 6who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony to be borne in its own times; 7whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth."
1 Timothy,2,8,"I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing. Instructions to Women"
1 Timothy,2,9,"In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment; 10but (which becometh women professing"
1 Timothy,2,11,Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.
1 Timothy,2,12,But I permit
1 Timothy,2,13,"For Adam was first formed, then Eve; 14and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression: 15but she shall be saved through the childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety."
1 Timothy,3,1,"Faithful is the saying, If a man seeketh the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work."
1 Timothy,3,2,"The bishop therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, soberminded, orderly, given to hospitality, apt to teach; 3no brawler, no striker; but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money; 4one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; 5(but if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) 6not a novice,"
1 Timothy,3,7,Moreover he must have good testimony from them that are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. Qualifications for Deacons (Acts 6:1–7)
1 Timothy,3,8,"Deacons in like manner must be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of"
1 Timothy,3,10,And let these also first be proved;
1 Timothy,3,11,"Women in like manner must be grave, not"
1 Timothy,3,12,"Let deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their children"
1 Timothy,3,13,"For they that have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. The Mystery of Godliness"
1 Timothy,3,14,"These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly; 15but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness; He who was manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, received up in glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,"But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, 2through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron; 3forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats,"
1 Timothy,4,4,"For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving: 5for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer. A Good Servant of Jesus Christ"
1 Timothy,4,6,"If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed until now: 7but refuse profane and old wives’ fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness: 8for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is,"
1 Timothy,4,9,"Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation."
1 Timothy,4,10,"For to this end we labour and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe."
1 Timothy,4,11,These things command and teach.
1 Timothy,4,12,Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to
1 Timothy,4,13,"Till I come, give heed to"
1 Timothy,4,14,"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by"
1 Timothy,4,15,Be diligent in these things; give thyself
1 Timothy,4,16,"Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee."
1 Timothy,5,1,"Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brethren: 2the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity. Honoring True Widows (Ruth 1:1–5)"
1 Timothy,5,3,Honour widows that are widows indeed.
1 Timothy,5,4,"But if any widow hath children or grandchildren, let them learn first to shew piety towards their own family, and to requite their parents: for this is acceptable in"
1 Timothy,5,5,"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, hath her hope set on God, and"
1 Timothy,5,6,But she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead
1 Timothy,5,7,"These things also command, that they may be without reproach."
1 Timothy,5,8,"But if any provideth not for his own, and specially his own household, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever."
1 Timothy,5,9,"Let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, 10well reported of for good works; if she hath brought up children, if she hath used hospitality to strangers, if she hath washed the saints’ feet, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath diligently followed"
1 Timothy,5,11,"But younger widows refuse: for when they have waxed wanton against Christ, they"
1 Timothy,5,13,"And withal they learn also to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and"
1 Timothy,5,14,"I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, give none occasion to the adversary for reviling: 15for already some"
1 Timothy,5,16,"If any woman that believeth hath widows, let her relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed. Honoring Elders"
1 Timothy,5,17,"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially those who labour in the"
1 Timothy,5,18,"For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out"
1 Timothy,5,19,"Against an elder receive not an accusation, except"
1 Timothy,5,20,"Them that sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear. A Charge to Timothy"
1 Timothy,5,21,"I charge thee in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these"
1 Timothy,5,22,"Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure."
1 Timothy,5,23,"Be no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities."
1 Timothy,5,24,"Some men’s sins are evident, going before unto judgment; and some men also they follow after."
1 Timothy,5,25,In like manner also there are good works that are evident; and such as are otherwise cannot be hid.
1 Timothy,6,1,"Let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the"
1 Timothy,6,2,"And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but let them serve them the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. These things teach and exhort. Reject False Doctrines"
1 Timothy,6,3,"If any man teacheth a different doctrine, and consenteth not to sound words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; 4he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but doting about questionings and disputes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 5wranglings of men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain. Godliness with Contentment"
1 Timothy,6,6,"But godliness with contentment is great gain: 7for we brought nothing into the world, for neither can"
1 Timothy,6,9,"But they that desire to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown"
1 Timothy,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows. Fight the Good Fight"
1 Timothy,6,11,"But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love,"
1 Timothy,6,12,"Fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal, whereunto thou"
1 Timothy,6,13,"I charge thee in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession; 14that thou keep the commandment, without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: 15which in its own times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; 16who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power eternal. Amen. A Charge to the Rich (Proverbs 23:1–5; James 5:1–6)"
1 Timothy,6,17,"Charge them that are rich in this present world, that they be not highminded, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; 18that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate; 19laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life which is life indeed. Guard the Faith"
1 Timothy,6,20,"O Timothy, guard that which is committed unto thee, turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called; 21which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you."
2 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, 2to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Faithfulness under Persecution (Matthew 10:16–25)"
2 Timothy,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day 4longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; 5having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also."
2 Timothy,1,6,"For the which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee"
2 Timothy,1,7,For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.
2 Timothy,1,8,"Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God; 9who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, 10but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel, 11whereunto"
2 Timothy,1,12,"For the which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day. Holding to Sound Teaching"
2 Timothy,1,13,"Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ"
2 Timothy,1,14,That good thing which was committed unto thee guard through the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.
2 Timothy,1,15,"This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and"
2 Timothy,1,16,"The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; 17but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me 18(the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well."
2 Timothy,2,1,"Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,2,"And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be"
2 Timothy,2,3,"Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,4,No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a
2 Timothy,2,5,"And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully."
2 Timothy,2,6,The husbandman that laboureth must be the first to partake of the fruits.
2 Timothy,2,7,Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.
2 Timothy,2,8,"Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel: 9wherein"
2 Timothy,2,10,"Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
2 Timothy,2,11,"Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him: 12if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us: 13if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself. The Lord’s Approved Workman"
2 Timothy,2,14,"Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they strive"
2 Timothy,2,15,"Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth."
2 Timothy,2,16,"But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness, 17and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 18men who concerning the truth have erred,"
2 Timothy,2,19,"Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."
2 Timothy,2,20,"Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth;"
2 Timothy,2,21,"If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, meet for the master’s use, prepared unto every good work."
2 Timothy,2,22,"But flee youthful lusts, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the"
2 Timothy,2,23,"But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender"
2 Timothy,2,24,"And the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing, 25in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth, 26and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by the Lord’s servant unto the will of God."
2 Timothy,3,1,"But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come."
2 Timothy,3,2,"For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good, 4traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; 5holding a form of godliness, but having denied"
2 Timothy,3,6,"For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts, 7ever learning, and never able to come"
2 Timothy,3,8,"And like as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also"

Hebrews,1,1,"God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners, 2hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds; 3who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; 4having become by so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they."
Hebrews,1,5,"For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee? and again, I will be to him a Father, And he shall be to me a Son?"
Hebrews,1,6,"And when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him."

Hebrews,2,13,"And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children which God hath given me."

Hebrews,3,7,"Wherefore, even as the Holy Ghost saith, Today if ye shall hear his voice,"

Hebrews,4,15,For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of
Hebrews,4,16,"Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help us in time of need."
Hebrews,5,1,"For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: 2who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity; 3and by reason thereof is bound, as for the people,"
Hebrews,5,4,"And no man taketh the honour unto himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron."
Hebrews,5,5,"So Christ also glorified not himself to be made a high priest, but he that spake unto him, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee: 6as he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,5,7,"Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear, 8though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered; 9and having been made perfect, he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation; 10named of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.

Hebrews,6,7,"For the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from God: 8but if it beareth thorns and thistles, it is rejected and nigh unto a curse; whose end is to be burned."

Hebrews,6,11,"And we desire that each one of you may shew the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end: 12that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. God’s Unchangeable Promise"
Hebrews,6,13,"For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he sware by himself,"
Hebrews,6,15,"And thus, having"
Hebrews,6,16,For men swear by the greater: and in every dispute of
Hebrews,6,17,"Wherein God, being minded to shew more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath: 18that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us; 19which we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil; 20whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,7,1,"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; 3without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually."
Hebrews,7,4,"Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the"
Hebrews,7,5,"And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priest’s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham: 6but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of"

Hebrews,7,11,"Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek,"
Hebrews,7,12,"For the priesthood being changed, there is made of"
Hebrews,7,13,"For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe,"
Hebrews,7,14,For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung
Hebrews,7,15,"And what we say is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest, 16who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life: 17for it is witnessed of him, Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,7,18,"For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness 19(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope,"
Hebrews,7,20,"And inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath 21(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, The Lord sware and will not repent himself, Thou art a priest for ever); 22by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant."
Hebrews,7,23,"And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing: 24but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable."
Hebrews,7,25,"Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; 27who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself."
Hebrews,7,28,"For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, appointeth a Son, perfected for evermore."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now in the things which we are saying the chief point is this: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, 2a minister of the sanctuary, and"
Hebrews,8,3,For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this high priest also have somewhat to offer.
Hebrews,8,4,"Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law; 5who serve that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned of God when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was shewed thee in the mount. The New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:26–40)"
Hebrews,8,6,"But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second."
Hebrews,8,8,"For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;"
Hebrews,8,9,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt; For they continued not in my covenant, And I regarded them not, saith the Lord."
Hebrews,8,10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, And on their heart also will I write them: And I will be to them a God, And they shall be to me a people:"
Hebrews,8,11,"And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them."
Hebrews,8,12,"For I will be merciful to their iniquities, And their sins will I remember no more."
Hebrews,8,13,"In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away."
Hebrews,9,1,"Now even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service, and its sanctuary, a sanctuary of this"
Hebrews,9,2,"For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, wherein were the candlestick, and the table,"
Hebrews,9,3,"And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies; 4having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; 5and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally."
Hebrews,9,6,"Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services; 7but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the errors of the people: 8the Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest, while as the first tabernacle is yet standing; 9which is a parable for the time now present; according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot, as touching the conscience, make the worshipper perfect, 10being only (with meats and drinks and divers washings) carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation. Redemption through His Blood"
Hebrews,9,11,"But Christ having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation, 12nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having"
Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh: 14how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
Hebrews,9,15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may"

Hebrews,9,24,"For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us: 25nor yet that he should offer himself often; as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own; 26else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away"

Hebrews,10,17,And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
Hebrews,10,18,"Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. A Call to Persevere (Jude 1:17–23)"
Hebrews,10,19,"Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus, 20by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 21and having a great priest over the house of God; 22let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our body washed with pure water: 23let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised: 24and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works; 25not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh."

Hebrews,11,2,For therein the elders had witness borne to them.

Hebrews,12,18,"For ye are not come unto a mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, 19and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them: 20for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned; 21and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake: 22but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels, 23to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, 24and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than that of Abel."

1 Peter,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, 5who by the power"
1 Peter,1,6,"Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief in manifold temptations, 7that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold that perisheth though it is proved by fire, might be found unto praise and glory and honour at the revelation of Jesus Christ: 8whom not having seen ye love; on whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory: 9receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."
1 Peter,1,10,"Concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: 11searching what time or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point unto, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that"
1 Peter,1,12,"To whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced unto you through them that preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Ghost sent forth from heaven; which things angels desire to look into. A Call to Holiness (Hebrews 12:14–17)"
1 Peter,1,13,"Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 14as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance: 15but like as he which called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living; 16because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy."
1 Peter,1,17,"And if ye call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to each man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear: 18knowing that ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers; 19but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, even the blood of Christ: 20who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of the times for your sake, 21who through him are believers in God, which raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God. The Enduring Word (Isaiah 40:6–8)"
1 Peter,1,22,"Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another from the heart fervently: 23having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth."
1 Peter,1,24,"For, All flesh is as grass, And all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth:"
1 Peter,1,25,But the word of the Lord abideth for ever. And this is the word of good tidings which was preached unto you.
1 Peter,2,1,"Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, 2as newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation; 3if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious: 4unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious, 5ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,2,6,"Because it is contained in scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame."
1 Peter,2,7,"For you therefore which believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; 8and, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed."
1 Peter,2,9,"But ye are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, that ye may shew forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light: 10which in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy."
1 Peter,2,11,"Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 12having your behaviour seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. Submission to Authorities (Romans 13:1–7)"
1 Peter,2,13,"Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; 14or unto governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well."
1 Peter,2,15,"For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:"
1 Peter,2,17,Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
1 Peter,2,18,"Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to"
1 Peter,2,19,"For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering"
1 Peter,2,20,"For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted for it, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. Christ’s Example of Suffering (Isaiah 53:1–8)"
1 Peter,2,21,"For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps: 22who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: 23who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: 24who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins,"
1 Peter,2,25,For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
1 Peter,3,1,"In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behaviour of their wives; 2beholding your chaste behaviour"
1 Peter,3,3,"Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel; 4but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the"
1 Peter,3,5,"For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands: 6as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror."
1 Peter,3,7,"Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honour unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered. Turning from Evil"
1 Peter,3,8,"Finally, be ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded: 9not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing."
1 Peter,3,10,"For, He that would love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile:"
1 Peter,3,11,"And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it."
1 Peter,3,12,"For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears unto their supplication: But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil."
1 Peter,3,13,"And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good? Suffering for Righteousness"
1 Peter,3,14,"But and if ye should suffer for righteousness’ sake, blessed are ye: and fear not their fear, neither be troubled; 15but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: being ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear: 16having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your"
1 Peter,3,17,"For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-"
1 Peter,3,18,"Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit; 19in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison, 20which aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water: 21which also after a true likeness doth now save you, even baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ; 22who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him."
1 Peter,4,1,"Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye yourselves also with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; 2that ye no longer should live the rest of your"
1 Peter,4,3,"For the time past may suffice to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles, and to have walked in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings, and abominable idolatries: 4wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them into the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you: 5who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the"
1 Peter,4,6,"For unto this end was the gospel preached even to the dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."
1 Peter,4,7,"But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore of sound mind, and be sober unto prayer: 8above all things being fervent in your love among yourselves; for love covereth a multitude of sins: 9using hospitality one to another without murmuring: 10according as each hath received a gift, ministering it among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God; 11if any man speaketh, speaking as it were oracles of God; if any man ministereth, ministering as of the strength which God supplieth: that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, whose is the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen. Suffering as Christians"
1 Peter,4,12,"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you, which cometh upon you to prove you, as though a strange thing happened unto you: 13but insomuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s"
1 Peter,4,14,"If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are ye; because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God"
1 Peter,4,15,"For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a meddler in other men’s matters: 16but if a man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify"

1 Peter,5,6,"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;"
1 Peter,5,8,"Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 9whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world. Benediction and Farewell"

2 Peter,1,12,"Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things, though ye know them,"

2 Peter,1,21,"For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Ghost."
2 Peter,2,1,"But there arose false prophets also among the people, as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought them, bringing"

2 Peter,2,3,"And in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose sentence now from of old lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not."
2 Peter,2,4,"For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; 5and spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; 6and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly; 7and delivered righteous Lot, sore distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked 8(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their lawless deeds): 9the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment; 10but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion. Daring, selfwilled, they tremble not to rail at dignities: 11whereas angels, though greater in might and power,"
2 Peter,2,12,"But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed, 13suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing; men that count it pleasure to revel in the day-time, spots and blemishes, revelling in their love-feasts while they feast with you; 14having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness; children of cursing; 15forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the hire of wrong-doing; 16but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a dumb ass spake with man’s voice and stayed the madness of the prophet."
2 Peter,2,17,"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness"
2 Peter,2,18,"For, uttering great swelling words of vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from them that live in error; 19promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is"
2 Peter,2,20,"For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome,"
2 Peter,2,21,"For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment"
2 Peter,2,22,"It has happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire."
2 Peter,3,1,"This is now, beloved, the second epistle that I write unto you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by putting you in remembrance; 2that ye should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour through your apostles: 3knowing this first, that in the last days mockers shall come with mockery, walking after their own lusts, 4and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for, from the day that the fathers fell asleep,"
2 Peter,3,5,"For this they wilfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the word of God; 6by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: 7but the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. The Day of the Lord (Zephaniah 1:7–18; Malachi 4:1–6; 1 Thessalonians 5:1–11)"
2 Peter,3,8,"But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a"
2 Peter,3,9,"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some count slackness; but is longsuffering to you-ward, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
2 Peter,3,10,"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up."
2 Peter,3,11,"Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy living and godliness, 12looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?"
2 Peter,3,13,"But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Final Exhortations"
