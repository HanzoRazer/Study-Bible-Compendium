It ended exactly 6 24- hour days later, with the chaotic earth made perfect a second time and inhabited as it was in Lucifer's kingdom, before Adam's time. Everything was ""very good,"" at once, proving that there was no long process of evolution from a few molecules seeking to improve themselves (1:31) 4 divine acts in day 7 (2:2) 1 God ended - divine completion and perfection (2:1-2; Dt. 32:4; Eccl. 3:11) 2 God rested - divine repose (2:2-3; Ex. 20:11; 31:17; Heb. 4:4) 3 God blessed -divine invocation(2:3) 4 God sanctified - divine separation and dedication (2:3: Ex. 20:8-11) ""Let"" defined (1:3) Let is used 13 times in this chapten 17564 times elsewhere, and in no case is an original creative actimpUed.The sense is made appear or made visible. expressing permission and purpose in connection with already existing things. The light, firmanent, waters, earth, darkness and all other things mentioned here were already in existence, but had been thrown into chaos and the laws which previously governed them had been made void. The very purpose of their existence had been annulled because of sin. Now, in the restorationtoperfection and original usefulness,God merely commands and the sun again gives light on"
Genesis,50,2,"Pet. 3:5-8). Thus the light of days 1, 2 and 3 camefrom thesunashasbeen the case every day since.Cp. let in Gen, 13:8; 18:4; 24:14-18; Mt. 7:4; 13:30; 27:22; Jn. 14:1; Phil, 2:5 for the true sense 2 divisions by God (1:3): 2 times (v 4,7). Here division is made by God, Himself because He is the only one who could restore day and night. In v 14-18 God commands the sun, moon and starstodivideday and night forever, of themselves, by natural law without a daily divine command. Both light and darkness had been created with the universe i n the beginning. Here they are not created but divided as before the chaos in v 2; Jet. 4:23-26-Ps. 104:6-9; 2 Pet. 3:5-8 ""Firmament"" defined (1:6) Heb. shamayim. expanse, something ^read out (Job 37:18; Isa .40:22; 44:24: Jer. 10:12; 51:15). It is called heaven (v 8); clouds (Job 26:8; Ps. 77:17: Pr. 8:28). It was created in the beginning as one of the heavens of v 1. It had served its purpose of retaining water above the earth throughout Lucifer's reign, hue upon his overthrow the earth was cursed by the firmament pouring out its waters and"
Genesis,50,2,"Pet. 3:5-7.The heaven of heavens and the clouds are distinguished in Scripture Qudg. 5:4; Ps. 147:8; Isa. 14:12-14; Dan. 7:13). See Heaven In Index Division of the waters (1:6) In the judgment on the original earth the vapoun condensed and fell upon the earth; and because the sun was withheld from shining on the earth the waters could not be vaporized again until the restoration of the sunlight. Hence, the waters did not naturally abate from the earthinthe first universal flood of Gen. 1:2, as they did continually in the flood of Noah (Gen. 7: 24; 8:3, 5, 8, 12). Because the waters were then divided again asbefore Gen, 1:2, natural laws took care of flood conditions on earth in Noah's time. Waters and firmament were both created in the beginning , and now were merely being restored as before the chaos of v 2 Earth restored (1: 9) Note that in day 2 part of the waters were placed in the clouds to give rain upon earth(v 6-8; Job 38:4-30; Amos 5:8; 9:6). Now the rest are commanded to return to the bowels of the earth, to river beds and low places of the earth created forthemand where they were before being commanded to assist in causing the flood of Gen. l:2.Cp. 7:11; 8:2; Ps, 104:8. Earth (dry land) then, could immediately appear asbefore when it w a s originally created and inhabited (1:1, 9; Isa. 45:18) Asah - made"" defined (1:7) Heb. asah ,to m ake out of already existing material. It is the opposite of bara, to create.See note g,l: l.It is translated made 659 times; m a ke 449 times; maker 16 times; makcth 59 ti ir es; makest 16times; maker 13 times; and madest 3 times. When Scripture reads ""in six days the Lord made heaven and earth"" it refers to their restoration in the 6 days after the curse of Gen. 1:2, and not to their original creation in the beginning (Ex. 20:8-11; 31:17) 2 gjeat lights (1:14): Heb. mawore, lightholders or lumi-naries(Ex. 25:6; 27:20; 35:8, 14, 28; 39! 37; Lev. 24; 2; Num. 4:9,16; Ps. 74; 16; 90:8; Pr. 15:30). The object of the 2 great lights is mentioned; that of the stars is not. They were to be the rulers of day and night - regulating their length, the amount of light and darkness and the intensity of their heat and cold. Here, the lights ate made not created. They were originally created with other parts of the universe in the beanning , while now they are made to fulfill their creative purposes again, in the newly restored earth. The work of day 1 proves the existence of these lights at that time, for we have merely the introduction of light and the division of day and night. Not only do we have the fact that the sun existed, but also that the diurnal motion of the earth on its axis was in operation The light of the first 3 days came from the same source asthe light of the lasts days and 2,261, 990 (or more) daysofthe6,193(or more) years from the restoration to 1959 A .D.See lengths of the 7 dispensations more) years from the restoration to 1959 A .D.See lengths of the 7 dispensations , p. 59 The lights shone upon the waters on days 1 and 2, but not upon the earth, for it was under water until day 3. With earth restored, permanent regulation of the planets in connection with it, as before chaos, was the next natural step 7fold purpose of lights (1:14) 1 Divide day and night; Ught and darkness (v 14, 18) 2 Be for signs (v 14) 3 Be for seasons (v 14) 4 Be for days (v 14) 5 Be for years (v 14) 6 Give Ught on earth (v 15, 17) 7 Rule day and night eternally (v 16, 18; 8:22) Source of lig ht (1:17) Here is proof that the light of days 1, 2, and 3 came from the sun, which was created before the 6 days of Gen. 1:3-2:25, and which had given light on earth all throughLucifer's kingdom before Adam's time and before being commanded not to give light on the cursed earth of Gen. 1:2; Jer. 4:23-26. Here we have merely the regulation of the sun, moon, and stars in connection with the earth which is restored to a second habitable state in day 3(1:9-13) The Solaric covenant is now made guaranteeing the present life on earth forever. See 15 great covenants , p. 57 Created - not made (1:21) Here the wexd created is used for the first time since v 1 (see note g, v 1). All that wasdonein the interval was a re-anangement and restoration of matter. Now, Ufe is introduced, which requires not simply constructive, but creative power. All forms of animal Ufe in the air and in the waters are embraced in the statements of this verse. In the first creative acts of God in v 1, the universe was brought into existence; in the second creative acts the multipUed thousands of bodies which were formed by God out of the ground are given self-existent and bodies which were formed by God out of the ground are given self-existent and self-productive Ufe, each after his kind (v 21; 2:19).Invl we have the origin of thepre-Adaroic world and inv 3-31 we have the restoration of the earth to a second habitable state and the origin of the Adamite world First blessing (1:22) First blessing - 3 gifts from God: 1 Fruitfulness. Heb. parah ,bear fruit, the power of pro-creation (1:28; 8:17; 9:1, 7; Ps. 128:3) 2 MultlpUcation. H e b. rabah , t o increase 3 Occupancy of suit able places . Heb. mala , to replenish (note b,1:28).There no doubt had been fish and fowl when Lucifer ruled (Jer. 4:23-26), but they were destroyed because there was no sunUglit during the flood of 1:2; Jer. 4: 23- 26.Therefore,Gen.l:2 was a longer period than thatof Noah's flood which did not destroy sea creatures Creation of man (1:27) In the third creative act of God the beasts and man were brought into be: ng (v 24-28. Cp. 1:1. 2). Their bodies were formed but their Ufe was created. Man's creation alone was not merely accompUshed by a divine fiat, but was also the subject of a divine council (v 26-28). So (as had been decreed by divine council) God created man in His own image (v 27). Man was a work oT God. not of molecules and monkeys. See IS factsdispro vingevo lutio n.r. 55 God's sabbath (heading. 2:1) God's sabbath could not be the same day as roan's, for Adam was not created until day 6 and had worked only one day.naming the animals (1:24-31; 2:7, 19- 25). There is no record of any sabbath for man for at least 2, 513 years after God rested on the 7th day. The first sabbath for man is mentioned in Ex. 16:23-29. It was a sabbath forlsrael only, as a sign between them and God (Ex,31:12- 18;Ezek. 20:12-24) tocom-memorate the deUverance of Israel from slavery - not to commemorate God's rest day of over 2,513 years before (Dt. 5:15) Shebii - seventh (2:2) Heb. shebii , seventh. God ceased work on this day of the week of recreation, not from fatigue, but from achievement (2:2-3). He had completed His work, and was refreshed (Ex. 31:17). Men were told to rest Ukewise and refresh was refreshed (Ex. 31:17). Men were told to rest Ukewise and refresh themselves on the 7th ddy after 6 days of work (Ex. 20:8-11; 23:12; 34; 21). This was a mere shadow or temporary picture of eternal rest (Col. 2: 14-17; Heb. 4:1-11) God's day of rest (2:3) Had rested. God rested on that one day, not on every 7th day from then until now. It was necessary for Him to work again when roan sinned (3:8-24), and not only for G days a week. The redemption program is carried on 7 days a week. Therefore, the 7th day was not sanctified or set apart for God's rest very long; and there is no statement here or elsewhere showing that man was commanded to rest, or that he rested every 7th day from this time forward. On the contrary, no roan was commanded to rest every 7th day until 2, 513 years later. See 22 facts about the sabbath, p. Ill 16 Jehovah titles (2:4): Jehovah-Elohim. The first occurrence of this title in hundreds of tiroes used. It roeans the self-existent or Eternal Creator theElohim in covenant relationship with His people. Jehovah really means the Eternal, the Immutable One, He who WAS. and IS, and IS TO COME (21:33; Ex. 3:13-14; 6:3; Ps. 83: 18;Isa.l2:2;26:4).ThenameJehovahis combined with other words winch form what we know as the Jehovah titles 1 Jehovah-Elohim - the Eternal Creator (2:4- 25) 2 Adonai-Jehovah - the Lord out Sovereign; Master Jehovah (15:2. 8) 3 Jehovah-Jireh - the Lord will see or provide (22:8-14) ner (Ex. 17:15) 4 Jehovah-Nissi - the Lord ourban— 5 Jehovah-Ropheka - the Lord our healer (Ex. 15:26) peace (Judg, 6:24) 6 Jehovah-Shalom - the Lord our 7 Jehovah-Tsidkeenu - the Lord our righteousness 0er. 23:6; 33:16) 8 Jehovah-Mekaddishkem -theLord our sancUfier (Ex. 31:13; Lev. 20:8; 21:8; 22:9, 16. 32; Ezek. 20:12) 9 Jehovah-Saboath - the Lord of hosu (1 Sam. 1:3; etc.. 281 times) 10 Jehovah-Shammah - the Lord is present (Ezek. 48:35) 11 Jehovah-Elyon - the Lord most high (Ps. 7:17: 47:2; 97:9) 11 Jehovah-Elyon - the Lord most high (Ps. 7:17: 47:2; 97:9) 12 1 eh oVa h-Rohi - the Lord my Shepherd (Ps. 23:1) Maker (Ps. 95:6) 13 Jehovah-Hoseenu - the Lord our 14 Jehovah-Eloheenu - the Lord our God (Ps. 99:5. 8, 9) 15 Jehovah-Eloheka - the Lord thy God (Ex. 2a2, 5, 7) (Zech. 14:5) 16 Jehovah-ElohaytheLord my Cod NOTES ON GENESIS C ON TIN UE D 53 1 B efon pUou ot the field were in tbe~e<nb (v S).

With the words, iii the day that God made the earth and the Heavens(v4), we have the commencement of anew section and a new narrative, cofuplete in itself, to a great extent. V 1:3-2; 4 are the summary of the 6 days' work: '2:4-25 are a mote de-uiledaccount of the workof days 2,3, 5, and 6. The first narrative states what God did and embraces the universe and all things tberein.The second is mainly a description of how the work of days 2,3, 5, and 6 was done. In the first , the Divine Being is called Elohi m. indi-cadng creative relationship and infinite power. In thc_second^ He ii called Jchovah-Flohim, indicating covenant relationship and infinite power, so as to inpdre man with implicit faith Original creations of God (1:1) The original creations of God include the heavens, the earth and all things The original creations of God include the heavens, the earth and all things therein as first brought into being. They were made perfect the first time. Cen. 1:1 refers to the dateleu past or the beginningof the creative ages (Job 38: Ps. 8:3-8; 19tl-6:Pr. 8:22-31;John 1:3.10; Acu 17:24-26; Col. 1:15-18; Heb. 1:1-12; 11:3: Rev. 4:11), The 6 days of re-crealioo (Cen. 1:3-2:25 ate a part of and the end of the creative ages, and have nothing to do with the original creations of the heavens and Cod in ttic eternal past ThatGod existed from all elemity is very clear in Scripture (Ps. 9a2; 93:2: Pr. 8:22-31; Mlc. i2: Jn. 1:1-3; Heb. a 14; Rev. 1:4-8: 4:8; 22:5.13).

The Bible is very clear as to there being 3 separate, distinct and eternal persons In the Godhead. See 8'J proofs of a Trinity, p. '280 of the FTiI God's plan is revealed in 3 distinct paru being carried out by these 3 persons. One, now known as the F ather holds the headship in the plan orcrea-tion and redemption of all things (1 Chr.29:Il: lCot.3:23: 11:3).Another, now called the Son , carries out the representative duties of the plan. God, the Father, creates and redeems BY Jesus Christ On. 1:3; Eph. 3:9: CoU I: 15-18: Heb.

Genesis,50,2,"Pet.3:13:Rev.21-22) The ptc-Addinite world (1:2) 18 proofs of a pre-Adaroite world: 1 In Gen, LI we have the orianal creation of the heavens and the earth. This is certainly pre-AJamite, for Adann was created rruch later as is clear Regarding the original creation, the following facts rrake it clear chat the term in the bezinnine used in Gen. h 1-2 does not refer to the tirre or woik of the 6 days of Gen. 1:3-2:26: (1) Tbc word and (a^ stated in note p. 51) is used 148 times in Gen. 1-2 to separate the 102 different acts of God. These acu are all independent and imporunt. The and of 1:2 proves that the work of v 2 is entirely independent of the work of v 1. While V1 records the original creation of the heavens and the earth, v 2 records the original dryland, or earth, made chaos and flooded through a great catastrophe which destroyed all life on a pre-A da mite earth (2) The word was in v2is from the verb to become, not the verb to be, which proves that the earth became waste and empty since its original creation and habitation in the beginning. See note 1, 1:2 (3) The phrase without form in v 2 is from the Heb. tohu, meaaing~wa8te, desolation.Itis trans.waste (Dt. 32:10); without forrr. ( Gen. 1:2; Jer. 4:23); vain (Isa. 45:18: 1 Sam, 12:21): cogfuaoo (Isa. 24:10; 34:11: 41:29): empcy Qob 26:7); vanity Qsa. 40:17.23; 44:9; 59: 4); nothing Qob 6:18; Isa. 40:17): and wilderness Qob 1-2:24: Ps. 107:40). It can be seen from these passages what the condition of the earth was, in v 2 of Gen. I.God did not originally create the earth in such a waste and ruined condition. It is stated in Isa. 43:18 that He did not create the earth tohu (vain, waste, desolate), yet in v 2 it is this way. Therefore, we are to conclude that the earth was made perfect, dry land, beautiful, and inhabited originally, and that later it became etr.pty, waste and a ruin because of sin (Dt. 32:4; Eccl. 3:11) (4) The Heb. for voij is bohu. emp-ty, ruin, void. It is trans, void (v 2; Jer.4:23): and emptiness (Isa. 34:11). The Heb. phrase tohu va bohu , waste and empty, describes the chaotic condition of the earth at the time it was cursed and made flooded because of the sins of Lucifer and the pre-Adaraitesjtcould not refer to the earth as originally created - beautiful, perfect, dry land 2 The earth was created to be inhabited (Isa. 45c 18), and was inhabited before the flood of Gen. 1:2 and the work of the 6 days of Adam's time (Gen. L-3-2:25; Isa. 14:12-14: Jer. 4: 23-26: Ezek. 28:11-17; 2 Pel. 3:5-8). See note 1 (3) above 3 The earth is called dryland (Gen. l:10)whichmeansGen,l: 1 could read, ""In the beginning God created the heaven and dry land."" Since it was created dry (not wet and flooded as in Gen. l:2)tnen it was immediately inhabited; and the flood of Gen. 1:2 was a curse, not a creative was immediately inhabited; and the flood of Gen. 1:2 was a curse, not a creative act. According to Ps. 136:6 the earth was originally created dry and ""stretched above the waters,"" not the waters stretched upon the earth (note g, Ps. 136:6). This requites a pre-Adamite race whose sin brought such a curse 4 In Gen. 1:2 the earth is not only flooded with water but covered with total darkness , the sun. moon, and stars having withdrawn their light, causing all life on earth tobe totally destroyed. This requires a pre-Adamito world with vegetation, birds, animals, and men as proved in Jer. 4:23-26, notes 5 We have the fact recorded in Gen. 1:2 that the earth, the waters, and the darkness Wire already in existence before the work of the 6 days wtnch began in Gen. 1:3 and continued until the earth was restored to a second habitable state in Gen. 2:25. Thus, it is clear from Gen, 1:1-2 (and related scriptures) thac (1) In the begintriTiB. the dateless past, and not in 6 days about 6,000 years ago, God created the heavens, including the sun, moon, and stars -all the heavenly bodies in space. See note h, Ps. 136:7 (2) In the beginning or the dateless past, as in point (1) above. God created the earth or dry land (3) The heavens and the earth were created b y God , a personal and an eternal Being; they were not the nrod-uct of molecules deciding to produce innumerableoffspringof heavenly and earthly things (4) The heavens were created before the earth was. Cp, Job 38:4-'7~ (5) Both the heavens and the earth were created before the earth was flooded (6) The earth was created dry land. not wet and flooded (v 1,10;Isa.45:18) (7) The waters that flooded the dry land or earth were created in the beginning along with the earth, to cause tne dryland to become productive (Job 38:4-30), and not to curse the eartti as in Gen. 1:2 (8) The darkness was also created in the beginning with day. or light, to help sustain life on the earth Qch 38: 4-41) (9) The earth only was cursed, flooded, and filled with darlaiess, not the heavens (v 2) We. therefore, conclude that Gen. 1:1-2 proves a pre-Adamite world that wasdestroyedina flood, which necessitated the making of the present A damite world so that the original purpose of God concerning the earth could be realized (Isa. 45:18) 6 It is further revealed in Gen. 1:2 that the Spirit of God began to (Isa. 45:18) 6 It is further revealed in Gen. 1:2 that the Spirit of God began to move upon the flooded earth and in the darkness to restore the dryland as before it was flooded. This also confirms the factof a pre-Adamite world which was destroyed, making it necessary to restore the earth to a second habitable state as inthe6days of Gen. 1:3-2:25 7 In Scripture, aU instances of obscuring the sun and bringing consequent darkness, and the two past cases of universal floods are revealed to be the result of judgment, not creation (Gen. 6:8-8:22; Ex. 10:21-23: Isa. i 30; Jer. 4:23-26). All predictions of such future darkness depict judgment (Mt.8:12: 24:29-31; Rev. 6:12-17; 8: 12; 9:2; 16:10; Isa. 13:10; Joel 2:30-3:16; A roos S: 18- 20).Could we say that Gen. 1:2 is an exception and the only place in Scripture where darkness and universal flood on the earth are not an act of judgment? If then, as in other cases, these are the result of judgment. Gen, 1:2 definitely proves there was a pre-Adamite world which was destroyed by darkness and flood No one questions the flood of Noah's time being an act of judgment passed upon free moral agents because of sin. No one doubtsthe existence of the free moral agents before the flood actually came. Why, then, doubt the existence of a pre-Adamite world which was destroyed by the darkness and flood of Gen, 1:2? That this was even a worse flood than the one of Noah's time, and an act ofgreater judgment in punishment of more horrible sins is clear from the outline of contrasts below Wefindproof of two universal floods on earth, one in Lucifer's day and another in Noah's, in Gen, 1:2; Isa. 14: 12-14; Jer. 4:23-26: 2 Pet. 3:5-8 20 contrasts between the 2 floods L u:ifer's Noah's lEatthmade waste-Not made waste (1:2; Jet, 4:23) (8:11-12,22) 2 Earth made empty-Not made empty"

But, in Lucifer's flood the fruitful place became a wilderness Qei. 4:23-26). New vegetation had to be planted in the 6 days, for the earth was totally desolate (1:11-12: 2:5, 8-17). This proveslhatLucifer's flood was on earth longer than (1:11-12: 2:5, 8-17). This proveslhatLucifer's flood was on earth longer than Noah's and without doubt, as judgment for a mote serious rebellion - a complete rebellion of the pie-Adamite world 8 The command for Adam to replenish the earth (fill it again) - not g lenish it, proves that the earth had een filled before this (Gen. 1:28). God gave the same command to Noah, after the second universal flood (ftl-2). Should we conclude from His command to Noah to replenish the earth that He meant to fill it Tor the first time, and not refill it? Substitute the word Ml (meaning supply for the fijst time) in Gen. 9:1; Isa. 2:6; 23:2; Jer, 31:25; Ezek, 26:2: 27:25, as some do inGen. 1:28 and see if it makes better sense. Whatever we conclude in these other places where replenish is used, let us be consistent and give the same meaning to Gen, 1:28 9 The fact that Lucifer had already ruled the earth and become a fallen creature before Adam's time is proof that Adam and his race were not the first ones on earth. We ate required to acknowledge thatSatan's fall was before Adam's time because he was al-readya fallen creature when he came into A dam's Eden (Gen. 3: 2 Cor.ll :3). Hence, he roust have fallen with a pre-Adamite creation 10 According to Isa.14:12-14 J-udfer actually invaded heaven from earth, hoping to defeat God and take His kingdom: but J.ucifer,hirnself was defeated and his kingdom cursed. Before his defeat he had a throne and therefore a kingdom and subjects to rule over. His kingdom was under the clouds, under the stars, and under heaven; therefore, on earth. Having weakened the nations over whom he ruled, and wanting to be UkeGod and take His place in heaven, Luciferled the invasion of heaven, AU this had to be before Adam's day, for no such things have occurred since Adam was created 11 In Ezek. 28:11-17 we have a picture of Lucifer before he fell, as the anointed cherub or protector o f the earth, asbeing full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, as rulingin a garden of Eden (before Adam), as being created of God and perfect in his ways up to the time of his falL The passage gives the reason for his fall and the result of it. The only time this could have been true of Satan was before the days of Adam, thus proving a pte-Adamite world 12 In Jer. 4:23-26 we have a full description of the earth under a total curse, as in Gen. 1:2. It was desolate and empty, the heavens had no light, the hills and mountain'! were undergoing convulsions, there was no roan, no bird, no animal,no fruitful place,and no city left standing because of God's fierce anger. The only time Jeremiah could have seen the earth without form and void and totally dark and desolate of all life was at the same time Moses saw it thus, and as recorded by him in Gen. 1:2.Thereneverhas been a time from Adam until now when the earth wasin such a state (not even at the time of Noah's flood), and there will never bea timeof suchacurse in the eternal time of Noah's flood), and there will never bea timeof suchacurse in the eternal future. The only time Jet, 4:23-26 could be fulfilled wasbefore Adam, for the earth was in such a condition when the Spirit began the 6 days' work of restoring it to a second habitable state (Gen. 1:2-21), Regarding the future, such will never be the condition of the eanhagain,foratthe2nd advent Christ will begin to reign over aU nations on earth forever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end (Gen. 3:22; ft 12; Isa. 9:6-7: 5*21; Dan. 2:44-45:7:13-14, 18. 27; Zech. 14; Lk. 1:32-"
Genesis,50,11,"J.5; 20:4-10; 22:4-5),Even the renovation of the heaven and earth at the end of the Millennium will not make the earth desolate as pictured in Gen. 1:2 and Jer. 4:23-24 (see notes, Rom.8:19-25;Heb,l: 10-12; 12:25-28; 2 Pet,3:10-13).Therefore. Jer, 4:23-26 must refer to the same judgment as pictured in Gen. 1:2, thus proving furthti that a real social system - men, birds, fruitful places, cities - existed before Adam. 13 Ps. 104:5-9 speaks of God sending a flood on the earth after its creation, at which time the waters stood above the mountains. V 7 identifies this as Lucifer's flood, saying ""At thy rebuke they fled."" InthecaseofNoah'sflood, the watcn slowly and naturally abated. Furthermore, v 9 makes it clear that this flood was at a time when God set a bound for the waters ""that they turn notagaintocovcrtheearth,"" and that is what happened in the 6 days' work of Gen. 1:3-2:25. Thus,Ps. 104:5-9refers tothe same flood asGen.l:2 and proves the existence of a pre-Adamite woild which was overthrown by a flood 14 Turning to the N. T. we find that Jesus taught the fall of Satan from heaven, in Lk. 10:18. When did he fall? Before A dam's time, for he was already a fallen creature when he came into Adam's Eden (Gen. 3). Why did he faU? Because of pride and wanting to exalt his earthly kingdom above God's (Isa. 14:12-16: Ezek, 28:11-17). What was the result of his fall? All of Satan's earthly subjects as well as over one-third ofCod'sown angels fell with him (Rev. 12:3, 7-12); and aUearth-nadoos were totally destroyed, alont; with vegetation, fish, fowls, and animals (2 Pet. 3:5-8), Thus, Lk. 10:13 substantiates the teaching of 0,T.passages regarding a pre-Adamite world 15 Jesus funhei uughi the overthrow of the pre- Adamite world by plainly stating that the world had been overthrown. See note i, Mt, 13:35 16 Paul also taught the overthrow of the pre-A damite world (Eph. 1:4: Heb. 1:3; 9t 26. See not^ at these scriptures and note i.Mt. 13:35). In Col, 1:15-18 he made it clear that there are thrones, principalities, and powers in heaven and in earth, visible and invisible. It should not be difficult then, to believe that Lucifer was given one of these thrones and a kingdom to rule over,before he feU, That his kingdom was on earthin a pre-Adamite period is indicated by the fact that he kingdom was on earthin a pre-Adamite period is indicated by the fact that he returned t o the earth after his fall, and moving with envy and jealousy brought about the downfall of thj new earth-ruler, Adam, Why all this desire to usurp man's dominion on earth if the earth was not one time Lucifer's place of rulership? Even liis eternal punishment wUl be in the lake of fire under the earth, which further proves his sin was in connection with the earth - and if so, when, if not at ttie time of a pre-Adamite world? 17 Peter was very definite in his stateroems regarding a social system overthrown before Adam, Sec Pre -Adaraites, p, 274 of the N,T, 18 John referred to the overtlirow of the pre-Adamite world (Rev, 13:3: 17: 3, notes; also note i, Mt, 13:35) Thus, itis clear that both testaments Continued.nctt page NOTES ON GENESIS CONTINUED 55 live proof of 3 rrc -». ji; ii woclJ.r':c | in an of » v»v».>uf, hejwen q» lieU. u: 1 ptUloMpliy - uo( « (clutiaflc Ucl :to iicavcn Stan T of I •i p. 0 foe t - in Mu.i^t. >^- ricatl) till U)- Wh.

Nor can be be neuuaU He must uke a sund either forCod and the Bible or for evolution and guesses 15 facts disproving evolutiocr 1 The Bible In iuenurety condemns the theories ofboth costiiic and organic evolution. It declares in no uncertain tenris that God created (brought into existence)all the material and moral creations: the aaimate and inanimate things, and that He it the flist and lag cause of allexiiting universes and the things therein The Bible declares Cod created the heavens and the earth (Cen, 1:1; Ps, 3: 1-*, 13tl-7; 10-2:25-27;Isa.45d8);God created great whales and every Uviag creature (Gen. 1:20): Cod created roan in His own image, in the Image of God c reated He him; male and female rteated He them (Cen. 1:26-28; 2:7, 19-25: 5:1- 2; 3t6); All things were made by Him; and without Hiro was not any thing made that was made Qt-L3); Cod created all things by Jesus Christ (Eph. 3:>. Col. 1:15-18); The , holding of all things by the word of is power (Heb. l:3); Tbou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they ate and were treated (Rev. 4:11) 2 It is a law of nature that nothiag reproduces anything greater than itself. If this is true of all species today, of which we have millions of examples, then it was true originally. The vaa creations of matter and Ufe had to come into existence by a superior power, not an inferior force. One thing is certain: all intelligence and matter could not have come from one or any number of molecules of uaiotclli-gencc. The most that has ever been done or can possibly be done IS to demonstrate the law of improvement of a species through bteedin.;and cultivation. No new species has been ot can be produced by suchUw. If left alone the planu and animals would deiiener-ate, not improve themselves in any de^iree, as seen in point 8 below Therefore, we must conclude that no amount of unintelligent matter could produce intelligence or intelli,;e:it beings - anything higher than itself. The intelligent and ir, numerable self- producing species of creatures, each with iu own eternal and consistent traits, disti:ict flavors, and infinite combinations of chemicals, could .levet be the disti:ict flavors, and infinite combinations of chemicals, could .levet be the product of unintelligent matter. Each one of the millions of creatures that reproduce their own kind by fixed and eternal laws must be the work of an all- powerful and all-wise Creator 3 The Bible declares (10 times in Gen. 1) that everythin*; created by God was given power to reproduce its own ki -■ .'.

NOTES ON GENESIS CONTINUED always will be All this is quite remarkable in view of the fact that there are over 2,00(\000 different species of plant and animal life. Each species proves the law of reproduction established by God - after his own kind. It is claimed that there are more than 1, 000, 000 species of insects. Species of beetles number 250, -000: buncrflies and moths 110,000; shellfish80,000; snails80,000; arachnids 60, 000; flies 40, 000; barnacles, crabs, lobsters, and shrimp 25, 000; fish 20,000; bees 10,000; wasps 10. 000; worms 9, 000; ants 5, 000; birds 1,200; and cockroaches 1,000. Besides these, there are many species of larger animals, and over 180,000 species of plants. Species of fungi number 100,-000; algae 20.000; mosses 20,000; corals 5,000;and sponges 3,000,besides many other species of living things All species exist in great variety, and the so-called proofs of evolutionists things All species exist in great variety, and the so-called proofs of evolutionists are merely variations, or minor changes within the same spccies.Outof billions of living organisms and fossils there is no evidence of the slightest tendency to evolve out of the original kind to which each belongs. There is only evidence o f development and normal growth ;but these arc not evolution. Improvement of a species and new varieties within the species ate not evolution. The theory of evolution teaches transm utation, a change in nature, substance, form, and alteration of essence by a slow and gradual processed mutancin from onespeciesto an-othcr. and from the lower to the tiigher. This has never been done, nor can it be done. In nature we find endless variety within each species or kind.but no change from one species to another. Without a change of species there can be no evolution. God has made life so that it interbreeds in closely related variations; and when interbreeding is attempted between different kinds of species it is found that there is an impassable gulf which cannot be crossed Life multiplies abundantly. Onebac-tetium in 24 hours can produce281.-500.000.000,000 descendents. A fly can lay 500 eggs in a season, each of which can develop into a fly capable of layingSOOeggsofitsown. If alleggs hatched and survived the original fly would have enough descendents in 6 months to covet the earth with flies, to a depth of about 50 feet. A common potatobugissaid tobe capable of producing 60. 000 offspring in a season; a single sunfish lays 30. 000. 000 eggs a seasoii;an oyster 100.000.000;a codfish 10,000,000;atoad20,000;spidersliave 2, 000 babies in one cocoon; a loggerhead turtle lays 1, 000 eggs at a time; and a pair of meadow mice could produce 1,000, 000 offspringin a year.An elm tree produces 1, 584,000,000 seeds and a barley seed 18,000 grains. But, out of the billions of yearly reproductions of nature, not one monkey's tail has been produced by anything except a monkey. There isnoproof of man in various stages from a molecule to a monkey, or from a monkey to a man! 4 There can be no evolution without the power o f reproduction in living things. Since reprod^jiction is a prior condition to evolution.it cannot be a product of it. Hence, we face the logical necessity for the creation of life and its powerof continued reproduction. The power of reproduction is not in the embryo, but only in the mature parent. An egg cannot produce an egg. It is also true that the egg is not improvable by itself. Improvement can come only in and tiuough the mature form. Therefore, the parent-form of life must have been created in the beginning to have produced an egg from which offspring alone can come 5 Science has proved that dead matter cannot generate Ufe; and that only life can come from pre-existing Ufe. When test tubes were filled with hay and other organic matter, when all life-germs were completely destroyed, when the tube organic matter, when all life-germs were completely destroyed, when the tube was hermetically sealed to exclude outer air. and while it was absolutely free of living germs, not one vestige of life appeared. The attempt to get the living out of the dead completely failed. The theory of spontaneous generation of evolutionists has had tobe given up. It is now recognized that life can only come from life. All life is dependent upon other life; the lower upon the highen the simple upon the complex; the powerless upon the powerful; the impersonal upon the personal; the unintelligent upon the intelligent; the non-existing upon the existing; the natural upon the spiritual; the temporary upon the eternal. Nothing can come from nothing or be produced by nothing 6 The argument of evolution from embryology - that embryos of different forms of me are somewhat alike so theymust have come from a common ancestor - has utterly failed, as have the theories of natural selection, and the survivalof the fittest. The similarity of embryos and their fast development to full growth are contrary to the principles of the evolutionary hypothesis. The chief foundation of evolution is that of a slow and tedious process over miUions and millions of years. This, the evolution teachers have to argue due to the fact that no single example of evolution from one species to another can be cited. Human and other embryos pass through various stages of growth very rapidly. In the case of some the progress of growth is so rapid that it is miraculous. Thus, evolutionists are forced to believe in miracles, which they deny, in other fields, but sustain in their own, in the effon to prove their claims. It is now known that there are radical differences between the embryos of vertebrates(backboned animals) and invertebrates (animals without backbones) i which we would not have if all things \ had a common ancestor. Some similarity among embryos of all forms of life should be expected, since all start ( individually from a single life-germ or a combination of two If a botanist would be asked the difference between an oak, a palm-tree, and a lichen, he would declare that they are separated from one another by the broadest line of classification. But if the germs of tliese plants were placed before him. to choose one from the other,he could not doit.Undet the most powerful microscope they would yieldnoclue.If analyzed by the chemist they would still keep their secret. The same is true of the life-germ of various animals and man.No one can teU which is which. What makes the little speck grow in the millions of different kinds of creatures? What is there which the eye cannot see that determines which of the many creatures it shall be? Only a personal and an infinite intelligent Being could make such unfailing laws of reproduction -after his kind 7 It is further argued that man and monkey are so similar that they must have come from a common ancestor. This is neither sound logic nor sound have come from a common ancestor. This is neither sound logic nor sound science. Resemblance proves nothing but resemblance. Similarity proves nothing but similarity. Resemblance and similarity run throughout aU natiue in things that have no connection with each other. Resemblance or similarity on some points is to be expected even though we accept creation by God. Such only magnifies the fact of an intelligent operator. This is true whether it is the Creator or a manufacturer as in every factory of man.The wheel, for example, is the same in the wagon, the car, locomotive.and plane. But such similarity (Joes not prove that the wagon evolved into an automobile, then into a locomotive, and finally into a plane All animals and men have the same kind of faculties to breathe, eat food, and perform other bodily functions, but no such similarity proves close rela-tioiiship. r.od made them thus so that all could exist alike in the same air and on similar foods. The dissimilarities between man and lower animals. not only in body, but also in brain, spirit and soul faculties prove that they are NOT vitally related. The differ-encesbetween man and monkey are so wide that any single bodily part is sufficient in itself to prove whether it is a part of mnn or monkey Evolutionists them selves confirm this fact by their promptness in deciding whether a bone is from a monkey or a man. There are hundreds of differences between the bodies of men and apes, and thousands of differences bctwee.i these two in mental.moral, spiritual, and habitual matters which prove evolution of man from apes or lower life an impossibility 8 Degeneration. The similarities between man and lower animals could be used to prove a process of degeneration from man more than a process of evolution to man. The Bible teaches that God made man before He made land animals - on day 6. Therefore, man came first, and then the monkey (Geji. 2:7, 19-25). Darwin's argument that plants and animals have within themselves tendencies to vary of their own accord in many and all directions to an unlimited degree, has been disproved many times. Mendel's experiments prove conclusively that plants and animals, even under man's selective skill in breeding, do not tend to vary in all directions and to an unlimited degree; but that the variations are within strict limits and work according to fixed laws producing unvarying results. The theory of natural selection and of inheritance of acquired characters has failed of proof. The forms of vegetables, plants, and animals that man succeeds iniraprov-ing by human selection and cultivation revert rapidly to type as soon as man's directing skill is removed. In all roan's selection and cultivation he can work only within the limits of the species. No change into new species has been pto-duced either by natural or artificial selection. The lionlaw of st erili ty stands guard at the far frontiers of the species and everything continues to reproduce after his kind There is a certain potency of development implanted in all things, but such potential powers are led out into actual development or improvement, not potential powers are led out into actual development or improvement, not through resident forces , as evolution teaches, but only through outside intervention and intelligent helpTMan can develop the wild rose into the American Beauty, or the wild pony into the Kentucky thoroughbred,by selection, better environment, breedirvg, etc.,but it is most significant that these improvements do not continue to increase, or even persist, when things are left to themselves. The rose reverts to a wild rose if left alone, and the horse begins to go back to its degenerated type the very minute man's skill is omitted If one takes a flock of highly developed pigeons, with all their shades of color and variety of mar kings.and turns them loose in the forest to see if they willimprove or degenerate he will find in a few years that they have all returned to one type. Compelled by an unfailing natural law. all will revert to common colors instead of being a variety with beautiful markings. Improvements brought about by care and selection in breeding will be gone, proving the law of evolution a failure The same thing will happen to man. If he neglects himself he will revert to a worse and lower type of man - like those who have been discovered on desert islands orin jungles. If the mind is neglected it will degenerate into irobeciUty and ignorance. Solitary confinement has the power to unmake men's minds and leave them idiots. If the conscience is neglected it will run off into lawlessness and sin. The soul that is neglected will go into ruin and depravity Only 3 possibilities are before us; bal-ance . improvement only to a certain degree, or degeneration. The Bible question is: How shall we escape if we neglect ? (Heb. 2:1-4). These 3 possibilities face every man. He has a desire to better himself and yet he is constantly beset with a gravitation to sin and the law of death working in his very being. We say that nature is full oflife, but in reality it is full of death. Plant life and animal life are kept alive by a temporary endowment which gives power over the elements that cause death. Withdraw the elements of life and the true nature will be revealed. Life is merely the suspension of these destructive powers - the sum total of the functions that resist death. Spiritual Ufe is the same - the sum total of the functions that resist sin. If we neglect the use of these powers death will result. The man who does notproperly use the powers toTive is as much dead as a man falUng 500 ft. is as good as dead the first foot of the faU. Unless he is stopped he isa dead man. One who continues to neglect Ufe is dead. If we neglect, degeneration sets in. If we use the powers of Ufe to resist sin, we Uve To use the argument that the savages of heathen darkness are more Uke monkeys than men in the civiUzed world is no proof of evolution; it is proof of degeneration. Man feU from original sinlessness and the highest degree of intelUgence to the present status. Adam had more intelUgence the day he was created than all men together have now. He could name all things and aU men today who learn all their Uves cannot yet do this (Gen. 2:19) Degeneration today who learn all their Uves cannot yet do this (Gen. 2:19) Degeneration explains the present unci viUzed parts erf the world, and the so-called cave-men -the Peking man. the Heidelberg, the Neanderthal, the Cro-Magnon roan and others. A11 problems between true science and the Bible can be solved by the facts of degeneration, or with the Bible truth of a pre-Adamite world.BeUef in the pre-Adamite system allows that the eanh could be milUons of years old. Pre- historic animals could have been a part of that system, as well as any different type of man, if such is ever excluded from Adam's race by estab-Ushed proof. See notes on the pre-Adamite wodd,p. 54 9 Fossil remains have been refened to as one of the strongest proofs of evolution.But evolutionists themselves acknowledge that this proof is extremely fragmentary, Umited, and obscure due to the fact of only a few fossil remains. Hence, they are forced to guess without proof. The m issing Unks between man and monkey have never been found. The manufactured bones of pre-historic men are fakes. The Piltdown man, for example, was no man at all. The story is that in a gravel pit in Sussex.Eng, .near Piltdown Common. 2 or 3 bits of a skull bone, a piece of jaw-bone, and a tooth were found by different persons in different places in different years. From these few scraps so-called scientists c onstructed the Piltdown man and named it the Dawn-man of the dateless past. From thesamebones another later type was made by another team of scientists. Finally it was acknowledged that the jaw-bone and tooth did not belong to the skull, but were those of a chimpanzee. The Java-man was built in Java from a skull bone.leg bone. 2 molars, and plaster-of-Paris; the Heidelberg-roan wasbuilt in Germany from ajaw-bone which was unquestionably human; the Peking-rnan of China was made from human skuU fragmenu found in a cave, in 1929; the Swanscornbe-man of England was made from the back and one side of a woman's skuU; the Fontechevade-man of France was made from a part of a skuU; the first Neanderthal-man was made from a skuU cap inCermany, which one great Germanpathologist declared to be the cranium of an idiot; the A usnalopithe-c usAfricanus-rnan of Africa was made from an ape skull found in a number of other ape skuUs and bones in Africa; and the Hesperopithecus Haroldcooku. the Nebraska-man, was made from a single pig tooth said to be 1, 000,000 years old,Pictures of these, the man-made specimens, have been the so- caUed proof shown in school textbooks. Such are the hoaxes which are being passed upon our innocent boys and girls by some educators in the name of science! 10 The old geological scheme to prove evolution has also been repudiated. Instead of the older rocks being found at the bottom and the younger rocks at the top, as would be the case if evolution were true, it is now found that top, as would be the case if evolution were true, it is now found that theoppositeisoftenthecase.This explodes the evolution-theory of natural building up of the strata 11 The fact of two universal floods instead of one (one in Lucifer's day and one in Noah's day) and a later division ofthe earth can easily explain the fossil remains being where they are.

Heb.11:3 says ""we understand that the worlds were framed by the WORD of GOD. so that things whichareseen werenotroade of things which do appear."" It is reasonable to believe that He used the same infinite care in original creation as in the recreation during the 6 days of Gen. 1:3-2:25. However, in the 6 days God FORMED with His hands, each of the livingcreaturesout of already existing material (1:20-27; 2:7-25; Job 26:13; Rom. 9:20; 1 Tiro. 2:13); whereas, originally, it was necessary for Him to bring material into existence as He needed it to form things, which He did by His WORD. Cp. Rom. 4:17; 2 Pet. 3:5 needed it to form things, which He did by His WORD. Cp. Rom. 4:17; 2 Pet. 3:5 with Heb. 11:3 God formedicreated; made with hands (1) Both light and darkness (Isa. 45:7) (2) Heavens (Ps. 8:3; 19:1; 102:25; Isa. (3) Earth(Ps.8:3.6; 90:2; 95:5) 40:12) (4) Planets (Ps.8:3; Isa. 40:26; 45:12;"
Genesis,50,4,"S:13) 2 When did God create and make the material universes '^ In the beginning is all the Bible says regarding this (1:1). It was in the dateless past , and not in the6days of 1:3-2:25, for the heavens and earth were already in existence by that tim e.The Bible does not say 6,000; 6, 000,000; 6, 000, 000, 000; or 600, -000, 000, 000 years ago, but we know definitely that original creation of universes tookplace more than 6,000 years agowhen Adam was created. See The pre- Adamite world , p. 54 3 HowlongwasGodcreatingihema-terial universes' ^ Though this is not stated in Scripture, we do have some facts in Gen. 1:3-2:25 concerning the recreation which a re very interesting. God took one day to divide darkness and light on the planet earth (1:3-5); anotherdayto divide the waters (1:6-8); a day to restore dry land (1:9-13); a day to regulate the sun, moon, and stars in connection with the restored earth(1:14-19); another day to create fish and fowl(l-20-23);and still another onetomakeman and land animals (1: ■24-31). With this in mind, let us consider how long it could have taken Him to create the 40, 000, 000. 000, 000, -000. 000,000 (40 sextilUon) stars which astronomers say are out in space They tell us that each one of these stars is a sun to other planets like our sun is to our planetary system. We have 9 major planets and 31satellites which, counting the sun, make 40 great bodies of material substance in this one system. If we suppose that eachofthe stars (40 sextillion) has the same in its planetary system, then there are 1, 520. -000.000.000,000,000. 000. 000 (1,520 sextillion) such bodies which took that many days (or more) to create.Reduced to years we should have the astonishing figure of 4,164,383,561,643,836.164.-383 years to create these systems alone 4 Why did G od c reate and make the materialuniverses'^ The answer is tohe inhabited with intelligent, free moral agents, to whom He could reveal Himself, and who would enjoy His infinite blessings and goodness.We are told that the earth was created to be inhabited andnodoubt the same is true of other habitable planets (Isa. 45:18; Eph. 1:3- andnodoubt the same is true of other habitable planets (Isa. 45:18; Eph. 1:3- ll;2:7;3:9-ll;Col.l:15-19;Rev.4:ll; 12:12; 13:6; Dan. 4:35).

This age took in all the period of the dateless pa St, the original creations, Lucifer's reign in perfection (E-zek. 28:15), the period of rebellion by Lucifer and pre-Adamites, the actual war between heaven and earth, culminating in the defeat of Lucifer and his armies astheyinvaded heaven Osa.14:12-14; Lk. 10:18), and the chaotic period on earth astheyinvaded heaven Osa.14:12-14; Lk. 10:18), and the chaotic period on earth after the defeat of Lucifer's kingdom (1:2; Jer. 4:23-26; 2 Pet. 3:5-8). These periods were of unknown length, and could be called the Eternal Past (2) The ante-diluvian age - from thebeginningof the 6 days of restoration of the heavens and earth to-a second habitable state (1:3-2:25) to the flood of Noah'stime; or, from theTlood of Lucifer (1:2) to the flood of Noah (6:8-8:14). This age included the dispensations of I nn o c e n c e and Conscience - 1,656 years (5:1- 32) (3) The present or post-diluvian agefrom the flood ofNoah(6:8-8:14) tothe Millennium (Rev. 19:11-20:7). Tins age takes in 4dispensations Human Government, Promise, Law, and Grace - already over 4,505 years by 1960 A.D. (4) The age to come - from the 2nd advent of Christ (Rev. 19:11-21) to the New Heavens and New Earth (Rev. 21-22). This age will last 1,000 yean (Rev. 20:4- 10) (5) The age of the ages from the end of the Millennium (Rev. 20:4-10) into all eternity to come whenGod will move His capital city from the planet heaven to the planet earth to reign for ever and ever (Rev. 11:15: 21:1-22:5; Gen. 9:12,16; 17:1-8; 2 Sam. 7; Ps. 89; Isa. 9:6-7; Ezek. 43:7; Dan. 2:44-45; 7:13-14. 18. 27; Lk. 1:32-33; 1 Cor. 15:24-28).

If voluntary righteousness was rejected, then God planned to add laws and punishments to enforce obedience for man's own good.God wanted roan to see that, in his fallen state, he could not choose the best good of being and of the universe, in himself, and that he was powerless to cope with the innumerable fallen angels and demons whom he had now entered into voluntary union with through sin, and who sought his eternal damnation. God wanted man to b e brought to helplessness in himself so that he would tum to Him for help, grace, and power against sin, Satan, fallen angels, demons, sickness, and suffering in lie struggle to overcome thecurse. He wanted man to know that He was the only true friend and helper, and that only through Him was there a way out of sin and the curse, and an opportunity for restoration to original dominion 6 Means ofGod in accomplishing His purpose. The conscience, freedom of the will, without restraint and compulsion to choose the right or wrong, and the malice of the devil were all the means ofGod to bring man to a place of uner dependence upon Him for help and redemption from the curse. The conscience demonstrated how exceedingly sinful man would become if he chose evil instead of good; the full freedom of action demonstrated how far man would go in his rebellion against God before it would be necessary for Him to Interfere for the good of His own eternal plan; and the malice of Satanic forces demonstrated the contrast between the two masters whom roan might serve while on probation. Such freedom o f the wiU and conscience was what man chose in the fall; and soGod permitted him to go to the full limit of wickedness that he might leam the folly of his own choice, and that all coming generations might profit thereby 7 Failure - 6fold (4:1-8:7): (1) Failure of Adam (6:3, notes) (2) Failure of Cain(4:1-16, notes) (3) Failure of Cain's descendants (4:17-24,notes) 25-5:32, notes) (4) Failure of Seth'sdescendants(4: (5) Failure of thedaughtetsof men, who sinned with fallen angels seeking to do away with pure Adamite stock through whom the seed of the woman was to come (6:1-7, 11-13, notes) (6) Failure of all men in general (4: 1-26; 6:1-7; 7:1;"

His grace and mercy in sparing roan to liave another chance and to continue in God's eternalplanforhira on the earth (6:8-22; 7:1; 1 Pet. 3:18-21). and preservation of clean animals for sacrifice so as to continue faith in the coming Redeemer (7:2; 8:20-22) were provisions of redemption for man after the flood. Men in those days were actually saved by grace through faith in the coming Redeemer, as we are now saved bygrace through faith in the Redeemer who has already come (6:8; Heb. 11; Eph, 2:8-9) III Dispensation of Human Government (8:15-11:32) Present oi post-diluvian age (Gen. 8:15-Rev. 19:10) 1 Name . So-called because human laws and human government wete instituted to regulate man's life after a long age of freedom of-conscience.God now gave Noah certain laws to govern the race by; and man was held responsible for self- government The first civil laws since Adam (1) Be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth (9:1, 7) (2) Rule over animals (9:2) (3) Allow animal food, instead of grains, herbs, vegetables only (9:3) (4) Eat no blood of animals (9:4) (4) Eat no blood of animals (9:4) (5) Do not murder (9:6) (6) Execute men who muider(9:6) (7) KeepMycovenanteternally(9: 8-17) Some of these laws have formed the basis of human laws in all ages since. It is necessary to punish criminals, individuals, and nations (Rom. 13:1-6; lPet.2:13- 14);hence.law enforcement is needful as well as war under cenain circumstances - when nations become criminal asa. 11:4-9; 65:20-25; Dan. 2:21; 4:17-25; 5:21; 7:1-25:8:20-25; 9:24-27; 11:2-45; Zech. 14; Rev. 19: 11-21) Human govemmetKs are part of the moral government of God and are needed for the preservation of human society on earth. Without law enforcement and punishments no government could long endure. The chief aim of moral and civil government is the highest good of all. Civil and family governments are necessary in securing this end. It is the duty of all people to help establish, maintain, support, and take part in human government for the preservation of society 2 Length - from Noah's flood to the call of Abraham when75-years-old - in all, 427 years (11:10-32; 12:5) 3 Favorable beginning. Man was rich in experience and wisdom, had true worship, new laws, new covenant, promises of blessing, dominion of the earth, and responsibility to rule himself forever (8:15-9:17) 4 Test . To obey the laws of human government, rule faithfully, punish criminals, consecrate to God and worship Him (8:20-9:17) 5 Purpose of God. To test man under a new standard of conduct. He had failed to live right without laws and restraint by punishment of civil rulers, now he wasforced toobeythe rightand reject the wrong (9:1-7) 6 Means of God in accomplishing His purpose. V ari ous laws of hum an gov em - ment were given and government was established by God, with man now being responsible to rule for the good of all 7 Failure - 4fo ld (9:18-11:9): (1) Failure of Noah (9:20-24) (2) Failure of Ham (9:22-27) (3) Failure of the daughters of men at the second eruption of fallen angels in their efforts to do away with pure Adamite stock through whom the seed of the woman wastocome (9:1-6; 11: 1-9; 6:1-4, notes) (4) Failure of men in general. Instead of scattering abroad on the earth according to God's repeated command for men to ""be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth"" (Gen. 1:28; 8:17; for men to ""be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth"" (Gen. 1:28; 8:17; 9:1). men united in an ungodly fashion (11:1-9). Pride, self-giatification, and hero-worship became prevalent in this age. Seecom-ments on Nimrod and his rebellion (note n. 10:8; p. 309ofN.T.) (8) ludgement for sin . During this dispensation God confused and multiplied the languages of men. This forced them to scatter abroad over all the face of the earth before it was divided (Gen. 11:1-9). Then, about 340 years after the flood. He divided the earth's land mass into continents and islands—just as we find it today (Gen. 10:25; 1 Chr. 1:19). This resulted in a far more effective and permanent separation of the different peoples. Furthermore, it explains how the American Indians and various other races came to be in different parts of the earth 9 God's provision of redemption. It was faith in the coming Redeemer and the gospel, and sacrifices typifying these truths (8:20; 12:8:Gal. 3:8; Heb, 4:2) IV Dispensation of Promise (12:l-Ex. 12:37) Present or post-diluvian age (Gen, 8:15-Rev. 19:10) 1 Name . So-called because of the promises and covenants made with Abraham and his seed. In this period God began to predict and emphasize the coming of the seed of the woman tobe through a particularbranch of the race. There had been a few predictions before, as in 3:15; 4:25; 9:24-27, but now Abraham's seed was designated as the special line through whom Christ should come.In this age many promises and predictions were made to this end (12:1-3; 17:7-8,19; 18:18; 21:12-13; 22:17; 26:3-4; 28:3-4, 13-15; 35:11-12; 49:10) I 2 Length - from Abraham's call at 75 years of age to the exodus from Egypt -430years(Ex. 12:40;Gal. 3:14-17).See twte o, 15:13 3 Favorable beginning. God now began to deal with a special branch of the race (Abraham's seed) in the fulfillment of His plan. Not only did He promise that the Messiah shonld come through them, but that the promised la nd would be given to them eternally, asabasefor world missionary and governmental operations (12:1-3, 7; 13: 14-18; 15:18-21; 17:7-19),and thatthe revelation ofGod should come through them(12:l-3; 15:13-21; 17:l-21;Rom. 3:1-2; 4:1-25: 9:4-5; Gal. 3:8; Heb. 11:8-19) 4 Test. For Abraham and his seed the test was to have faith in God .obey Him, remain segregated from all other nations, and evangelize the God .obey Him, remain segregated from all other nations, and evangelize the world (12:1-3; 15:4-6; 17:1-21; 26:3-4; 28:13-15) 5 Purpose ofGod. To choose one roan through whom Messiah should come, to use him and his seed as His representatives in the earth, and to give them C anaan as a base of operation concerning Hisprogram amongmenin the gospel and in government eternally. The second eruption of the sons of God among men had already begun and giants werebeingbom. They were beginning to possess the very land God had in mind for His own headquarters on earth (12:6).ItbeingHisplan to use the sword of Israel to destroy these giants so as topreserve a pure line for Messiah to come through, God allowed Abraham's offspringtobecomeagreat and mighty nation down in Egypt.It was His further purpose toshow the heathen, through Abraham, the difference between serving Him and other gods, and to make Israel an example to all men physically, mentally, morally, spiritually, and financially, as a nation enjoying theblessings of the trueGod, so that others should be won to Him by suchbenefits.Neverwasthepurpose of God expressed more fully atrd clearly to any people; and never before did a nation have intheir power such means of blessing all nations and bringing about universal peace, prosperity, and eternal salvation as Israel (12:1-3; 15: 4-6; 17:1-21; 26:3-4; 28:13-15; GaL 3:8- 14; Dt. 7:6-9) 6 Means ofGod in accornplishing His purpose. The call ofGod, the covenants and promises.and the personal dealings of God were His means in fulfilling His plan withlsrael(12:1-3; 17:l-21;Roro. 2:1-2; 9:4-5) 7 Failure - 5fold (12:l-Ex. 12:40): (1) Failure of Abraham (11:31-12: 6; 12:10-20; 16:1-16; 17:18; 20:1-18) (2) Failure of Isaac (26:6-35; 27: 1-4) (3) Failure of Jacob (25:27-34; 27: 1-33; 31:1-42; 33:14; 37:3) (4) Failure ofthe sons of Jacob (37: 4-6; 38:1-30) (5) Failure of Israel after the death of Jacob and sons (Ex. 2:11-14; 5:21) 8 Judgment for sin (Ex.1: 7-6:30).The judgment upon Israel was bondage in Egypt "" thebeginning of oppression by Gentiles to be carried on eventually by 8 world kingdoms. See 8 mountain kingdom s and Israel, p. 311 of N.T. and The tiroes of the Gentiles, p. 873. The judgment upon Egypt was the 10 plagues. See p. 110 9 God's provision of redemption. Israel had the gospel (Gal. 3:8; Heb. 4:2) and the typical program of sacrifices which, in shadow, taught them of redemption the typical program of sacrifices which, in shadow, taught them of redemption through the Messiah (Ex. 12; 25:1-40:38; Lev. 1:1-10:20; 23:1-44) V Dispensation of Law (Ex. 12:38-Mt. 2:23) Present or post-diluvian age (Gen. 8:15-Rev. 19:10) 1 Name. So-called because of the law given to Moses, which became part ofthe rule of faith and practice during the period between Moses and Christ.

No passage even hints that these kingdoms will be made up entirely of bom-again people or that the new birth is the necessary qualification for continuing to live on the earth after God sets up His kingdom among men. \v'hatwedo read of these kingdoms is that there will be sinners here at that time (65:20), men wiU need to be judged and rebuked (2:2^; 11:3-5; Mic. 4:3), kingdoms diat wUl not submit will be destroyed (60: 12), men will still need the gospel of salvation (11:9; 52:7), diey will sail disobey ( Zech, 14:16-21), there wiU be enemies here to put down (1 Cot. 15:24-28), and that the final act of putting them down and bringing aU things to the complete obedience of God wiU take place at the end of die 1,000 years (Rev. 20: 7-10) 7 Zech. 8:23 speaks of heathen submitting be cause of hearing about God reigning in Zion-when Jewish missionaries go out from Zion and Jerusalem to win them (cp. 52:7).

For this reason He told them that they did not fast unto Him, but for themselves (7:5-C).

This much we can rely upon, that the change will be made as quickly as possible, that wars and banles will be avoided wherever they can be, that much will be accomplished by miraculous powers being demonstrated in the hcalingof the heathen and other -wise winning them over by the gospel program, and that Christ's rule will DC one of patience and as much peace as possible until the plan of God is fully realized and all rebels are destroyed (Isa.

It was predicted here that they would finally remember God in aU countries where they lived with their children; and when they would return to their own land (v 9). They were to be brought again to Pal- esUne-gathered from all parts of the earth. In the complete fulfillment of this diere would be 30 many returning that there would be no room to receive them (v 10). This certainly suggests a great boom in Palestine and the East when the Messiah reigns.

The sword was to touch the life of One who was a Man and a Fellow of Jehovah (v 7). TheHeb. for fellow is awmceih, from a primitive root meaning to associate with;companionship; comrade; kindred man; another fellow of the same kind and nature. It proves that diere is more than one person in the Godhead. This Shepherd is a fe llow-God, another -God, a comrade-God, an associate-God, a kindred -God. Only here is the viord trans. fcliow;cLsc.vhcre it is trans. another fLev. 19:11; 25:17); and neighbour (Uv. 6:2; 18:20; 19:11. 15, 17; 24:19; 25:14,15); but even these renderings uplxoldie idea that the reference is to another person of the same kind and nature. In this idea that the reference is to another person of the same kind and nature. In this passage both persons arc called Lord fv 7; 14:9). In V 6 -7 Jehovah speaks of what Israel will say concerning the Messiah; in v 7 Jehovah calls the Messiah My Shepherd, tlie Man that is My Fellow, and says: smite the Shepherd (My shepherd, not Me) and the sheep shall be scattered: and I (the Lord of hosts) will turn Mine hand upon the little ones. If ihe Lord calls another persor. My Shepherd, and My Fellow , then there must be two persons referred to One Father (MaL 2:10) AllmenhaveonefatJierindie original created parent; God is not the creator ofeach person after diat, as reproduced by maruTechnically, Cod only created one man and one woman; all others are reproductions of the original pair. God gave man and all other creatures power in themselves to reproduce themselves. To be a child of^ God and have the authority tocaUHira Father, onesftould be born again of the Holy Spirit and be adopted into His family (In. 3:3-5; Rom. 8:14-16). Sinners ate not children cf God. The doctrine of tfie universal brotherhood of men and the universal Fatherhood of God is foreign toScrip-ture. Men are either children of the devilby choice and nature or children of God by choice and nature. Cp. Jn, 8:44; Eph. 2:1-3; IJn. 3:8. This principle not only holds true in sonshipand fathediood, but also in creation. One has to be created anew in Christ to be considered created of God as an individual; otherwise he is a Creadon of God only duough the creation of the first parents (2 Cor. 5:17-18; Eph. 2: 10; 4:24). Ine sinner, being a child of the devil, and destined to wrath (Eph. 2:1-3; 1 Jn. 3:8-10) becomes the creation of God only dirough choice and consecration to the same end to which God is consecrated I change not (Mai. 3:6) Icb-arpenot. This could only refer to basic character, and to keeping cove - nant,nottoactsof judgment or mercy when needed. God has repented or changed His mind when it became necessary because of free moral agents rebelling to the point of judgment; andthiswasin keeping with His character. He is absolute in holiness and justice, and is morally and divinely obligated for the good of all to judge the few or all if need be-or to show mercy to one and all should they meet the conditioiu of mercy, God does not and cannot change His original and eternal plan and purpose, but He can and does change some ways and means of fulfilling the plan. See Repent in Index The minor prophets: The 12 prophets (Hosea through Mal-achi) are called the lesser or minor prophets, not.because they are less ira-portant or less inspired, but only because the prophecies are considered shorter. This is not technically true al -together, for the book of Zechariah, having only 211 verses compared to Daniel's 357, has 6,444 words compared to Daniel's 5,175. Regarding the major prophets there are 6,444 words compared to Daniel's 5,175. Regarding the major prophets there are others not so recognized which could have been c lassed as such if we regarded the nimi -ber of predictions made. Moses and David made many more predicuons than Daniel, for instance. In the Hebrew Bible the O. T. profrfiets were divided into two groups: 1 The former prophets (Joshua to 2 Kings. See Zech. 1:4; 7:7, 12) 2 The latter prophets (Isaiah to Mal-achi, with the exception of Daniel) The book of Daniel was placed with the Hagiograt^a . Sacred '■""■'riters in the Hebrew Bible, which included Psalms, Proverbs,Job, Ruth, Lamentations,"
Genesis,50,2,"Chronicles. Besides this division and the above two the only odier one was die Law , or the 5 books of Moses. The 12 minor Mophets were considered one nation. Of die 12 books, 6 are dated; and they may be divided thus: 9 before the captivity, and 3 after it r'vsev'-i BETWEEN THE TESTAMENTS Between the testajrents. Igael continued In her strjg^ej for existence and restoration d unag the penod between Mala-chi and the events of the N. T. Ezra and Nehemiah left a settled form of government in Palestine, ruled by a council of elders and priests who forrr.ed an ecclesiastical court,and who interpreted the law and en forced obedi • eoce. Triey were the Great Sypagogue of 120 memben which ruled for 150 years, until Simon the Just, about 292 B.C. They held that the law was given in a2foldform: the written law consisting of brief official enactments, and the oral law ofmoie copious details passed down fiom Moses to Joshua and the elden that outlived him, and on to the prophets, being conveyed by Jeremiah toEzxa who gave it to theGreat Synagogue,to whom Nehemiah gave a complete library of the sacred books (2 Mac. 213).TotheGreat Synagogue (of which Ezra wasthe founder and president) the Jews owe acknowledgement for the 613 Precepts, and the oral tradition w ic . may be coosidered the groundwork of the Talmud -referred toby Christ (Mt. 5:21, 27, 31, 33, 38, 43: 15:2-6; Mk. 3-li) and the apostles (Gal. l:14;Col. 2:8; 1 Pet. 1:18) as the tradition of the elden and doctrines and commandments of men Ezra and Nehemiah set up synagogues in many towns for worship, schools of Instruction, and local courts where rr.en were tried for crimes against the state and society. Attached to each synagogue was a body of rulers - civil magistrates and ecclesiastical preiyters. During this time Palestine was ruled by Persia and formed only a part of a province under the Satiap of Syria In 331 B.C., after the victories of Alexander theGreat, of Greece, over Persia, he took possession of victories of Alexander theGreat, of Greece, over Persia, he took possession of Syria, allowing the Jews to retain self-government and their own religion. When he built Alexandria in Egypt, he invited manyjews to settle there, giving ihem equal rights with his other subjects. It was here that the famous Septuagint"

Both Greece and Macedonia became a part of the Roman empire In all this time (331-165 B. C.) the Syrian and Egyptian divisions of Alexander's empire fought with each other, off and on, over the possession of Palestine. It was during this time that Dan. 11:1-34 was fulfilled, ending with the reign of AntiochusEpiphanes who took Jerusalem about 170 B. C. and polluted the temple, compelling the Jews to sacrifice to idols. He erected the statue ofjupitetonthe altar ofbumt offerings, sacrificed swine, burned the Scriptures, and prohibited the worship of Jehovah. At tUs time the Maccabees arose - an Asmoruan family. Under them the Jews became victorious. Jerusalem was liberated and true worship of God was re-established in December, 165 B. C. It was then the Feast of Dedication was instituted: and it continued until the time of Christ, The Maccabean family were able to hold the main sway in Judea, but were forced to make some terms with the Romans under whose protection they retained considerable freedom In 47 B.C.JuliusCaesargave Hyrcanus and his heirs aU rights of the high priesthood, and the right of appeal to Caesar for all Jews. Exemption from all tribute every 7th year was also granted to the Jews because they neither sowed nor reaped in that year. Furdiermore, they received freedom from military service, and were given the right to meet and assemble together according to their own customs and laws. All this was ratified by the Roman senate In 44 B.C. For maintenance of order and general polineal government a Rxjman official presided over all Syria In 37 B.C. Herod die Great, by the aid of Roman troops, deposed the last Asmonian prince, Antigonus, and became the nominal sovereign of the Jews, subject to Rome. He betrayed his people to the Rom.ans, fostered im-m.orality,cultivated alien customs, encouraged mistrust.corrupted the priesthood, and tTiassacred many nobles. He built the temple on a magnificent scale.This loss of temporal power nobles. He built the temple on a magnificent scale.This loss of temporal power drove the Jews to a state of pride over the past and made them rebellious in heart against the Romans. Pharisees, scribes, and lawyers became more esteem.ed than priests and Levites. From the much confusion and conooversy among the Jews over interpretations of the law and prophecy came ttie two great sects -the Pharisees and Sadducees.

His line in Lk . 3:23-38 is through Nathan, another son (2 Sam. 5:14), and Iteli, the father of Mary. Both lineswere necessary in fulfilling prophecy.

God had also sworn to David that his line through Solomon would forever dt on his throne(2 Sam. 7).

The idea here is to demand somediing that is due one because of family and redemptive rights. Five times it is found in V 7-11. The first letters of ask, seek, and lyiock ^lell ""ASK."" It is God's will that we ask and get what we want (Ps. 23:1; 34:9-10; 84:11; Mk. 11:24; Jn. 15:7. 16) V Seeking must be with the whole heart (Dl. 4:29; 2 Chr. 7:14; 11:16; 15:2; Pr. 8:17: Lk. 15:8; Col. 3:1; Heb. 11: 6; Jas. 1:5-8; 1 Pet. 3:11) 7:14; 11:16; 15:2; Pr. 8:17: Lk. 15:8; Col. 3:1; Heb. 11: 6; Jas. 1:5-8; 1 Pet. 3:11) w The third way of getting an answer to prayer (Lk. 11:5-13; 18:1-8) . To ask implies want; seeking implies loss; and knocking impUes need. One must ask with confidence and humility; seek with care and application; and knock with earnesmess and penevet-ance (Lk, 11:4-8) X No exception to the rule for anyone. If there is it is because of the failure to ask in faith, nothing wavering(Jas. 1:5-8), to seek diligently (Heb. 11: 6), and to knock with importunity (Lk. 11:5-13; 18:1-8). The only reason for unanswered prayer to a Christian is ""unbelief"" (Mt. 17:17-21; Jas, 1: 5-8; Heb. 11:5). Unbelief is caused by wrong teaching (Rom. 10:17). The promises are unlimited (Ps. 34:9-10; 84:11; 91:1-12; Mt. 17:20; 21:22; Mk. 9:23: 11:22-24; Jn, 15:7, 16), so if ST.

Even later He forbad His disciples to make it known (Mt. 16:13-20). He made no public claim of it at first. but simply did tlie works that the prophets had predicted the Messiah would do (Ml. 11:1-6) 2 He wanted people to fulfill the law and offer the testimony that Moses commanded in sucU cases (Lev. 14:4, 10, 21-22). Ineachcase it would have to be known to thepnestshowone was cleansed and tills should be sutti-cicnt proof of His Messialiship to the priests. The Jewisli rabbis taugtit that cleansing lepers should be characteristic of the Mesaali, so His very works proved it before He was forced by opposition to make such claim for Himself 3 He wanted to shun popularity and human acclaim and the evil effects of mob clamour to make Him King. When this did happen He got away from it all(Jii. 6:15-21). By tills time He knew it was lime to declare Himself to the people, so never again did He say, ""Tell no man,"" as in Mu 8: 4; Mk. 8:26, 30; Lk. 5:14; 3:56; 9:21 Lk. 5:14; 3:56; 9:21 4 Jcsiis set an example of putting healings to the test before testimony is given for them.

What was it He bore away by taking upon Himself''The case before us is not sins, but our griefs (sicknesses), and sorrows (pains, Isa. 53:4; Mt. 8:17% He did not bear them merely to eater into the fello.vshipof our sufferings, but to deliver us from them. It would be useless for Him tobear them in our stead if He stiUleftustobeat them. Naturally, sins were borne, but so were all sicknesses and diseases and all evil which sinbrouglii intothe world (Rom. 8:17-24; 1 Pet. 2:24). Such were not mere types o f spiritual diseases, a s some teach, but actual diseases bome by Christ alona.with sin. The ultimate redemption by atonement is not only to remove aU sins, but also all sicknesses with complete redemption of body as well as soul (Rom. 8:11, 17-24;Phil. 3:21; Eph.5:27). If God deals with sin now. He also deals with disease as clearly revealed in the whole truth (Isa. 6:10; 61:1; Mt. 13:15: Jn, 10:10). "" With His stripes we are healed "" (Isa. 53:5; Mt. 8:17; 1 Pet. 2:24) f Feebleness of mind and body, malady, frailty, disease, sickness, weakness. All this Christ bore on the cross, fulfilling Isa. 53. Every infirmity is not a disease or sickness but all these are infirmities(Lk. 5:15; 7:21; 8:2; 13:11-12; Jn, 5:5). Priests had infirmities (Heb. 5:2; 7:28), but not diseases or physical imperfections, for they had to be perfect physically (Lev. 21:17-24). All saints have infirmities or weaknesses of various kinds (Rom. 8: 26), but not necessarily sickness and disease (Rom. 14:1-2; 15:1). Paul had infirmities or weaknesses in body because of the sufferings of 2 Cor, 11: 24-30; 12:5-10; GaL 4:13, but there is no indication that he had acknesses and diseases that Christ died to take from him. His "" thorn"" was ""a messenger (angel) of Saun"" who caused these beatings, stonings, etc. (2 Cor. 12:7). Any weakness in body, soul, spirit, faith, ability, etc. is an infirmity. The sameGr. word astheneia is tr^ns. weakness (1 Cor. 2:3; 15:43; 2 Cor, 12:9; 13:4: Heb. 11:34) and infirmity (Rom. 8:26; 15:1; 2 Cor. 11: 24-30; Rom. 6:19; Heb. 4:15; 5:2; 7:28) g Used only 4 times and always of bodily diseases (Dt, 28:59; 29:22; Mt. 8:17; Mk.3:15). The word "" sickn es?"" isused 20 times and "" sick "" 88 times and not once of spiritual sickness so often referred to by modem teachers.

Being one of the most important doctrines of the HolyBible, this isreferred to manyhundredsofiimesin both testaments. In some Bible statistics it is claimed that there are 33,000 promises in Scripture.But it must be remembered that there are not this many verses in the Bible. See N.T. promises, p. 316 There are 750 promises in the N. T., but only 250 separate benefits due to the There are 750 promises in the N. T., but only 250 separate benefits due to the fact that many of the promises ate repeated in different books. Some are not in the form of a promise, but the truths they contain make the basis of our claims for gospel benefits, so they are listed as promises.Genetally,verses are Listed with the book wherein the promise is found first Tribulation not world-wide ( 6:8) 1 The first 4 seals apply only to a 4th part of the earth (v 8) 2 The martyrdom ofthe saints in 6:9-11 is primarily Inside the Roman Empire territory where the great whore of Rev. 17 dominates the 10 kings 3 The 144. 000 Jews of Rev. 7:1-8 are sealed from the nation of Israel in Palestine, for the woman, national Israel, brings forth the raanchild (Rev. 12). since the nation is notmadeupof all the Jews still scattered, then the whole prophecy centers around Palestine 4 The great tribulation saints of 7:9-17 are martyred onlyin that pan ofthe earth where the tribulation will be -the old Roman Empire territory, a s proved in Rev. 13 dealing with the extent of Antichrist's reign 5 The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th trumpets are over only a third pan of the earth (8:7-12) 6 The 6th tru mpet causes only a third pan of men to be killed (9:18) 7 Jerusalem and Israel are the ones affected in the troubles of 11-1-13: 12:1-17 8 The Antichrist rule will be only over the 10 kingdoms ofthe old Roman Empire territory (Rev. 13, notes) 9 The events of 14:8-20 concern Babylon, beast ■■•'orshippers, manyts, and Armageddon in Palestine 10 The vial judgments are also limited to thekingdomof Antichrist (16:2, 10,12; 18:1-24).

Revelation,22,12,"V 1 Under the 6th seal in the first 3 1/2 years of the 70th week (v \ZS 2 Between the 7th seal and the first trumpet in the first 3 1/2 years (8:5) 3 Under the 7th trumpet in the middle of the week (11:19) 4 Under the 7th vial at the end of the week (11:13; 16:18) Zech. 14:4-8) 4 Under the 7th vial at the end of the week (11:13; 16:18) Zech. 14:4-8) Jesus predicted many earthqtiakes for the last days as a sign of lis second advent (Mt. 24:7; Mk. 13:8; Lk. 21:11). Several are mentioned in Bible history (Amosl:l;Zech.l4:5;Mt,8:24; 27:51; 28:2; Acts 16:25).The greatest earthquake of all will take place at the end of the Millennium (Hag, 2:6-7.21-22; Heb. 12:25- 29; 2 Pet. 3:10-13; Rev. 20:11). This will residt in the renovation of the heavens and eanh. making the 3rd perfect earth, and the end ofthe earth's 2nd sinful career (Rev. 21-22; Isa. 66:22-24) Why Dan not sealed (7:4) AU, except Dan. The names of Dan and Ephiaim ate not mentioned here. The names of Levi and Joseph take their places.To explain the omission of Dan, manyuse Dt. 29:18-21.but which one of the tribes did not go into idolatry'' The real reason for none of Dan being sealed here is that none are savants of God (v 3) at that time. Dan will be restored with the other tribes in the Millennium, so the idolatry of Dan is no reason for the tribe being left out here(Ezek. 4«:30-35; Rev. 21:12) NOTES ON R E V E L A TION CONTINUED 10 proofs of the rapture taking place in Rev. ~. 1: Gr. metatauta, after these lIungs(note m.Jn. 5:1). TWs Gr. phrase is usej at thebeginning and at enJ of this verse thus: "" Afterthese things (after writing the things concerning the churches of Rev. 2-3), I lookcJ. ..a doot was opened in heaven: and the first voice... said.Coine up hither, and I will show thee things which must be a fter these things"" , that is.aftet the churches(4:l). This confijrT:s and settles the question as to the time of the fulfill::'ent of all the events of Rev. 4-22. They MUST BE after these things of the churches, or after the rapture of the church. The church is no longer on earth when the events of Rev. 4-22 take place 1 Christ said the things of Rev. 4-22 MUST BE hereafter, that is, after the churches, as proved above and also in note r,Rev. 1:19. If this is true, then the church is raptured before these things of Rev. 4-22, and after t he things of the churches of Rev.2-3. It the things which are (Rev. 2-3) con ce tn the church, then the things which must be hereafter the things which are must concern events after the churches. The church must be here during the time of the fulfillment of the things concerning the churches, and it must not be here during the fulfillment the things concerning the churches, and it must not be here during the fulfillment of the things after the churches. The church then is raptured in Rev. 4:1 petween the thing; ■''tach are (Rev. 2-J) and the t hings >.hich MUST BE hereafter, iEat is, after the churches (Rev. 4-22) 2 The words church and churches mentioned in the book up to the last verse of Rev. 3 are found 19 times in Rev. 1-3 and tiotone time in the third division of Revelation which contains the things which MUST Bt after the churches f4:l-22:5). They are found again in me conclusion of the book (Rev.22:6-21), but only a fter the things whichMUST BEafterthe churches are fully revealed. If the church were on earth during the fulfillment of Rev. 4-22 it certainly would be mentioned 3 The enthroned elders are representative of the raptured saints and they are always seen in heaven after Rev, 4:1. See note a. Rev. 4:4 4 The 70th week of Daniel will be the last seven yean of this age, during whichtimeallofRev. 4-19; Mt. 24-25 will be fulfilled. This week concerns Israel, not the church, therefore, the church must be raptured before this week,asinRev.4:1.See Rapture. 230 5 There is noplace for the rapture of the church and O. T .saintsother than in Rev. 4:1. The manchild and the great tribulation saints are the only com- paniestobe saved and raptured during Daniel's 70th week and these are distinct companies from the church and O.T. saints, as proved in notes on Rev. 4:4. Therefore, the church is either caught up in Rev. 4:1 - after the churches of Rev. 2-3 and before the events coming after the churches of Rev. 4-22, or it is never micntioned in Revelation as to its rapture. If it were to be caught up any time during this week it surely would have been men-tiooed. The church could not be the manchild or the tribulation saints, as proved in notes on Rev. 7, 12, and 14 6 InLk.21:34-36 wehave the promise of Jesus that the saved ^111 be ac= counted worthy to escape all t hese things , and to stand before the Son of Man. The things they will escape are those of Mt. 24;4-26; Uk, 21:4-19 and Rev. 6-19 7 In 1 Th. 5:1-11 we have another definite promise assuring us that saints will escape the wrath of God (of Rev. 6-19). God has not appointed us to this wrath, but to obtain deliverance through JcsusChrist so we canlive with Christ(lTh, 5:9- 11). Itow could saints comfort one another as stated in this scnptute and in 1 Th. 4:16-17; Tit. 2: 13 if the only hope they had was the coming wrath of God in the future tribulation"" 8 In 2 Th. 2:6-8 it is definitely shown that the rapture takes place before the 8 In 2 Th. 2:6-8 it is definitely shown that the rapture takes place before the revelation of the a ntichrist and before the 70th week of Daniel. The events of Rev. 4-19 will take place during this week, so the rapture must take place in Rev. 4:1 9 There is a rarkeJ chanecin God's attitude toward humianity in general, from that of mercy (Rev. l-i)tothaiof judgmient (Rev. 4-19). The seals, trumpets, and vials all picture judgment throughout Daniers70thweek. If the church does nut go through any of these things, as proved already, then the rapture must take place in Rev. 4:1 10 An individual or a body of individuals can be identified by peculiarities and characteristics. If the church is to be on earth and isthe subject of Rev.4-19, then its earmarks should be seen. But such are not to be found. On the other hand, earmarks of Israel are seen throu^out the book after Rev. 4:1. The earmarks of the church are seen up to this point only. This proves that two different institutions arc dealt with in different parts of the book: first, the church until its rapture in kev. 4:1; secondly, Israel a fter the rapture of the church to the second advent of Christ (Rev. 4-19) 20 earmarks of Israel after Rev. 4:1: (1) In Matthew, the Hebrew Gospel, there are 92 references to the O. T.; in Hebrews there are 102; but in Revelation there 285. This proves the Jewish character of the book after Rev. 4:1 (2) The word Lamb is used 27 times in Rev. 4-22 and not once in the church section of Rev, 1-3. It is never used in the Pauline epistlesto the churches. It is used only 4 other times in theN. T. and always in connection with Israel (Jn. 1:29, 36: Acts 8:32; 1 Pet. 1:19) (3) The terms the Lion of Juda h and the Root of David are Jewish (Rev. 6:5) (4) The 144, 000 of Rev.7:1-8; 14:1-5 are Jewish. They will be saved during the events after the rapture (5) The eventsof the seals, trumpets, and vials are a partial repetition of the plagues upon Egypt and are for the same purpose-that of judgjngGentiles fortheir mistreatment of Israel. They fulfill many O.T. prophecies of punishments upon Gentiles because of their oppressions of Israel (Isa. 24:21; 26:20-21; 29:6-8;jer.30:6-9;Ezek.38-39; Dan. 12:1; etc.). Not one such prediction is ever made concerning the church (6) Thetribulationof Rev. 6-19 concerns Israel (Jer. 30:6-9; Dan. 12:1; Mt. 24:15-22) (7^ Daniel's 70th week concerns Israel and Jerusalem only(Dan. 9:24,27) (8) The church age comes between the 69th and 70th weeks of Daniel, proving that Israel is dealt with during the 70th week. See notes, Dan. 9:24-27 (9) The only saved Gentiles in Rev. 4-19 are the tribulation saints and they are not the church (Rev. 6:9-11; 7:9-17; 15:2-4; 20:4-6). This confirms the Jewish aspect of Rev. 4-10 flO) Theminisiryof the angelsaround me altar (8:2-5) is familiar to Israel only (11) The mystery of God promised by me prophets is Jewish (10:7) ^12) The temple, altar, temple worship, court of the temple, holy city, olive trees, ark of the covenant, etc. of Rev, 11 are all Jewish, not Christian (13) The kingdoms of this world becoming Christ's is the fulfUlment of Jewishptophets(ll: 15; isa. 9:6- 7;Dan. 7:13-14; Zech. 14:1-21; Lk. 1:32-33) (14) The woman an^ iranehild are Jewish, as proved in Rev. 12, notes (15) A dragon with 7 heads and 10 horns, showing rulershipof the nations that have persecuted Israel in the times of the Gentiles, also proves a Jewish connection(Rcv. 12). It could not be a fit symbol in connection with the church (16) Michael (12:7) always stands for Israel (Dan. 10:13-21: 12:1) (17) The remnant (12:17) is Jewish nsa. 1:9, note) (18) Literal Babylon (16:17-21; 18:1-24) provesa Jewish connection,as seen in Isa. 13-14; Jer. 50-51. The church has no relationship with 3abylon (19) Armageddon and the iccond advent (16:13-16; 19:11-21) prove a Jewish connection. Neither subject is ever used of the church (20) The Millenniu;-.' and the New rarth were predicted in connection withlsrael hundreds of times(Rcv. 20-22; Isa. 2; 65; 66; etc.), but not once with the church 63 post-rapture events (4:1): The beginning of the 3rd and last division of Levelation - the things which MUST BE AFTER THE CHURCHES (4: 1-22:5). These events arc from Reve- v lauon only.iithcrs could be added from the prophets; Mt. 24; Lk. 21; etc. ,but these arc enough to serve as an outline of post-rapture events 1 1st scab rise of A ntichrist (6:1) 2 2nd seal: war (6:3-4) 3 3rd seal; famine (6:5-6) 4 4th seal: death and hell (6:7-3) 5 5th scaL first r.anyrs (6:9-11) 6 6th seal: wrath of God (6:12-17) 7 144,000 Jews sealed (7:1-8) 3 Tribulation mart>Ts worship (7:9-9 7th seal: silence in heaven(8:1) 17) 10 7 angels given 7 uumpets (8: J) 11 Priestly angel ministers (3:3-5) 12 7 angids prepare to sound (8:6) 13 1st trumpet: hail, fire, blood(8:7) 14 2na trumpet: sea to blood (8:8-9) 15 3rd trumpet: waters poisoned (8: 10-11) 16 4th trumpet planets darkened (8: 17 Angel announces 3 woes(8:13) 12) 18 5th trumpet: the first woe - loosing of denx)ns to torncnt men (9:1-12) 19 6th trumpet: the second woe - loosing of 200,000,000 demons to slay 1/3 of men (9:13-21) 20 Temple and city defiled (11:1-2) 21 2 wimesses appear on earth (11: 3-12) 22 Great earthquake in Jerusalem (11:13) 23 7th trumpet: announcements (11: 15-18) 24 Heavenly temple opened (11:19) 24 Heavenly temple opened (11:19) 25 Sun-clothed woman travails (12: 1-2) 26 Dragon attacks the manchild (12: 3-4) 27 Manchild caught up to heaven (12:5) 28 The woman flees for 3 1/2 years 29 .Var in heaven (12:7-12) (12:6) 30 Satan attacks the woman (12: 13-16) 31 Saun attacks the remnant (12:17) 32 Beast out of sea; Antichrist given power over nations (13:1-10, 18) 33 Beast out of earth; false prophet begins beast worship (13:11-17) 34'The 144,000 Jews, the manchild, presented to God (14:1-5) 35 Everlasting gospel preached by an angel (14:6-7) 36 Fall of Baoylon announced by angel (14:8) 37 Doom of beast worshippers announced by an angel (14:9-12) 38 Blessing to martyrs announced (14:13) 39 Harvest: Armageddon (14:14-16) 40 Vintage: Armageddon (14:17-2m 41 7 vial judgments prepared (15:1, 6-7) 42 Tribulation martyrs worship (15: 2-4) 43 Heavenlytaberaacleopcned(15:5— 44 lstvial:soreson n'en(16: 2) 16:1) 45 2nd vial: sea to blood (16:3) 45 2nd vial: sea to blood (16:3) 46 3rd v-ial: rivets to blood (16:4-7)"

This excludes Moses or any other man who has already died as one of the wimesses 17 rhey wiU remain dead for 3 1/2 days and then be resurrected(v 8-11). This ftither proves that jhey are two men who have never died and that they will not be resurrected, immiortal men when they come from heaven to begin their ministry 18 There would seem to be only two men in the Bible who could fulfil these facts about the two wimesses. They are Enoch and Elijah. That Elijah will be cncofthem is clearly predicted in Mai. 4:5-6. John theBaptist was never Elijah, fulfiUi nil this prophecy. Hesaidthathe wasnotElijah(Jn. 1:21). He only came in the same spirit and power of Elijah to prepare the hearts of men for the Messiah's first advent in the way that Elijah wiU prepare their hearts for the Messiah's first advent in the way that Elijah wiU prepare their hearts for the second coming of the Messiah (Lk. 1: 17). Enochisthc onlyotherman translated that he should not see death in his lifetime on earth (Gen. 5:21-24; Heb. 11:5; 2 Ki. 2). Both were prophets of judgirent (Jude 14-15; 1 Ki. 17-18). Both must come back and die their own appointed death on earth as aU men must who livebcfore the rapture (Heb. 9:27; 1 Cor. 15:51-58). If either Enoch or Elijah had been translated in immortal, glorified bodies they would have been the first- fruits of the lesui-rcction instead of Christ( 1 Cor. 15:20-23). This proves they are in heaven in meir natural bodies. They will continue there until their return to fulfil Rev. 11. The lives ofEnochand Elijah are parallel in every sense, so their cases rise or fall together as to being the two witnesses NOT ES ON REVELATION CONTINUE D 307 The sun-clothed woman (12:1) 1 Israel isoften spoken of as a woman rratried toGod under the terms of the old covenant (Isa, 54:1-6; Jet. 3:1-14: Hos. 2:14-23) 2 The church is not once symbolized by a woman, married or unmarried. It is never called the bride of Christ (see p. 312). The church is spoken of as a man (note g.Eph. 2:15). Therefore, the cESch could not be the sun-clothed woman of Rev. 12 3 The false church is spoken of as a woman, a great whore(Rev.l7),butthis could not be the sun-clothed woman 4 The Bible mentions only 3 classes of people today: the church,the Jews, and the Gentiles( 1 Cor. 10:32). A t the middleofDaniel's 70th week when the woman travails and brings fonh the manchild, the church has been gone from the earth for at least 3 1/2 years (notes t and y. Rev. 4:1). This leaves only 2 classes after the rapture: Jews and Gentiles. The woman could not symbolize the Gentiles, because they are the ones persecuting the woman. Therefore, the woman must symbolize national Israel 5 Israel is the one primarily dealt with in Rev. 4-19, not the church (see point 10, p. 306, col. 2) 6 The sun, moon, and 12 stars symbolize Israel, as proved in Gen.37:9-11 6 The sun, moon, and 12 stars symbolize Israel, as proved in Gen.37:9-11 7 The Jews are the only people in Scripture spoken of as going through travailin the last Jays(v 2-5; Mt. 24.8; Mk. 13:8; Isa. 66:7-8: Jer. 30:6-9; Mic. 5:3; Zech. 12:10-13:1) 8 Israelis identifiedasthewomanby the wars against.her and her seed. The same predictions of this woman are found in connection with Israel in the 0,T,solheymustbethesaroe(Dan. 7: 21: 8:9-14,24-25; 9:27; 11:40-45; 12: 1, 7; Joel 3; Zech, 12:1-9; 13:8-9; 14:1-21) 9 The whole 70th week of Dairiel 9: 27 concerns Israel and Jerusalem,as did the first 69 weeks (Dan. 9:24-27). The church is not once mentioned in connection with these last day events 10 The persecution, flight, and protection ofthe woman in the wilderness prove her to be Israel (v 6, 13-16): (1) Isaiah (16:1-5) predicts the fUght of Israel into Moab and Edom, and m ention s S ela or P etra, the a ncient capital of Edom as their headquarters during the tribulation. The church is not the subject of any O. T. prophecy (2) Isaiah (26:20-21) predicts the protecQon of Israel until the indignation (tribulation) be past (3) Isaiah (63:l-5)picturesChristln His second advent as descending from the direction of Edom where the Israelites are to be protected. Cp, Mt. 24:27 (4) Isaiah (42:11-13) spe a k i n g of the Lord coming to earth to prevail over His enemies predicts that the Jews in the wilderness and the rock (Sela) wUl sing of Him (5) Psalms( 6>.6-12; 108:8-13)predict that God will reserve Edom fto:Ti the Antichrist and refer to the leading of Israel into the strong city (Sela or Petra). See notes k-r, Ps. 60:8-10 (6) Ezekiel(20:33-44)speaks of Israel Deing gathered back from the nations in the last days and of her going into the wilderness where God will plead with her as He did when she came out of Egypt, The two w'tnessesof Rev. 11 will be the "".Moses and Aaron"" of those days (7) Daniel (11:36-45) reveals the conquest of manycountries, including Palestine, but predicts that Edom, Moab, and Ammon wiU escape him (the Antichrist). This is the place reserved of God for Israel to be protected in the wilderness 3 1/2 years (Rev. 12:6, 14) (8) Hosea (2:14-23) speaks of the wilderness where Israel wUl flee from the Antichrist (9) Matthew ( 24:15-22) predicts the AntichriSt brealdnghis 7-year covenant (9) Matthew ( 24:15-22) predicts the AntichriSt brealdnghis 7-year covenant with Israel (Dan. 9:27), the setting up of the abominationofdesolationinthe temple at Jerusalem, and the flight of Israel fro mjudea into the mountains ot wilderness during the great tribulation (10) Revelation (12:6,13-16) makes the final prediction of Israel going into the wilderness to be protected 3 1/2 years from the Antichrist The manchild (12:5) 15 proofs 144, 000 are the manchild: 1 It has been proved that the sun-clothed woman is national Israel. The manchild then, could not be either the Gentiles or the church which is made up mainly of Gentiles (Acts 15:13-18), The woman would have to produce her own kind, according to the law of reproduction given by God (Gen, 1:21-28), Therefore, if the woman is Jewish the manchild must also be JewisfuT he woman represents a company of people. The manchild must also represent a companyofpeople.Thereisnoother company in the events of Rev.4-19 that could possibly be symbolized by the manchild other than the 144,000 Jews of Rev. 7 and 14 2 The manchild cannot be Christ because everything from Rev, 4:1 on MUST BE after the cr.urcries of Rev. 2:1-3:22. How could John see the historical ascension of Christ as happening among the things tobein the middle of Daniel's 70thweekor 3 1/2 years before the second advent of Chrisf! 3 The manchild cannot be the church as a whole, or in part, as some teach, because the church is raptured in Rev. 4:1 before the events of Rev. 4-22 which MUST BE after the churches (see 10 proofs of the rapture , p. 306) 4 The manchild represents a company of all living people who will be translated without seeing death. The woman brings forth either a dead or a living child, not one partly dead and partly aUve. The dragon could not kill one already dead at birth (12:4), The childis caught up toGod aUve as soon as it is bom (12:4-5). The 144,000are the only ones in all of the events of Rev, 4-22 (WHICH MUST BE AFTER THE CHURCHES)that couldpossibly be the manchild whose life the dragon tries to take (7:1-8: 14:1-5). Since the O.T. saints and church saints are all resurrected to immortality by this time, it would be impossible for the dragon to kill them. See p. 227, 230 5 Rev. 7:1-8; 9:4; 12:5; 14:1-5 give a complete revelation of the 144^000 -their number, salvation, sealing in the forehead, protection through the first 6 trumpets, rapture under the 7th trum -pet as the manchild, and their destiny and position inheaven after their rapture. If one of these passages is taken awaythe position inheaven after their rapture. If one of these passages is taken awaythe revelation about them is incomplete, ve have them on earth all throughthe first 6 trumpets(7:1-3,9:4), and in heaven immediately after the catching up ofthe manchild in the 7th trumpet(14:l-5), soiftheyare not the manchild who is he and how did the 144,000 get to heaven?' in Rev, 14:1-5 it is stated that the 144, 000 are before God's throne in heaven, having been redeemed FROM the earth and FROM among men. They are an heavenly people the la St 3 1/2 yearsof the tribulation. How and when were they translated if not as the manchild of Rev. 12:5'' 6 The time of the rapture of the 144,000 proves them to be the manchild. The time of their translation is identical with tliat of the manchild (12:5; 14:1-5) 7 We have seen that the church and O.T. saints are to be raptured before Daniel's 70th week and the tribulation (note r. Rev. 1:19: p. 227. 230, 306), We have also seen that the great multitude of tribulation saints will be killed mainly after and raptured after the 144, 000 are in heaveD<notes, Rev,6:9-11; 7:9-17). The only other company caught up besidesthese is the 144,000 and the only place for their rapture is in Rev, 12:5.Therefore, the manchild and the 144,000 roust be the same, if they are not the same, then we do not know whom the manchild represents or how the 144, 000 get to heaven. Where is the revelation of their rapture if not in 12:5^ 8 Theplacewherethel44, 000 are, in 14:1-5 proves they will be inheaven duringthelastS 1/2 yearsof the tribulation, so they must be raptured before then, when, if not as the manchUd':' The Mt, Sionistheheavenlyone (Heb, 12:22-24; Rev, 14:1, note f) 9 The 144.000 are flfSt-fruits toGod from Israel after the rapture of every saved Jew and Gentile ofthe church in 4:1. They are not saved when the church is raptured or they would gs up also (1 Th.4:16; 1 Cor. 15:23). Since they are saved after that - in the first 3 1/2 yearsofthetribulationand since they are in heaven the last 3 1/2 yean of the tribulation, their translation must bethe same as that of the manchild in Rev. 12:5, which isin the middle of the tribulation. If the manchild, which represents a company of Jews from Israel, were to be saved and raptured before the 144,000, then the manchild would be the first-fruits to God from Israel and t»ot the 144, 000. But since the 144,000 are to be the ffrst-fruits, then it is clear that they are the first Jews saved and raptured from Israel during the tribulation of 7 years between the rapture of the church and the second advent. Thisprovesthatthe 144,000 are the ones symboli zed by the manchild 10 There is only one company saved and raptured between the rapture ofthe church There is only one company saved and raptured between the rapture ofthe church at the beginning of Daniel's 70th week and the raptureofihe tribulation saints at the end of this week. That company is symbolized by the manchild and clearly revealed to be 144, 000 Jews(7:l-8; 9:4; 12:5; 14:1-5). Iftheyare not the same,then there are two translations in the roiddle-of the week-one revealed and the other not; the history of one given after reaching heaven and the other not; the identity of one clearly stated and the other not. Thus, mystery after mystery appears i f there are two companies instead of one 11 The 144,000 are specifically sealed for protection to go through the trumpet judgments only (7:1- 3; 9:4).

Even if we ignores all the O.T. prophecies above, we should be forced to believe in a literal city for the fulfilment of Rev. 14:5; 16:17-21: 13:1-24 NOTES ON REVELATION CONTINUED 309 Mystery Babylon (17:11 13proofs the whorea religjous system : 1 playing the whore in symbolic language alwa ys refers to religious fornication and idolatry (v 1-4; Isa. 23:17; 57:3-7; Jar. 3:2-9; Ezek. 16: 1-63: 20:30-32; 23:7-49;Hos.4:12-19; Nah, 3:4. Literal fornication must also be understood in some of these) 2 Her caudng the many nations to commit fornication with her, proves that idolatrous reUgious practices are being referred to, as in passages above 3 She is not a political power for she is not classed as one with ""the kings of the earth"". She only causes the kings andinhabitantsof the earth tobe drunk with the wine of her fomication(v 2,4^. Since fornication here refers to religious harlotry then her influence over the nations is through religion 4 The beast which the woman rides is the 8th kingdom, made up of the many waters or peoples inside the old Roman Empire territory(v 1,3,11,15). Since the beast itself is the kingdom, the woman must be reUgion dominating the kingdom until she is destroyed by it (V 12-17) 5 Theattireofthegreatwhoreiden-tifies her as a religious system or as a whore committing spiritual fornication, duping political powers by her whoredoms and idolatries (v 4). The purple, scarlet, precious stones, pearls, and golden vessels indicate the wealth of the system. Cp. Ezek. 23:40-41 6 The golden cup in her hand, full of her uncleanness, spiritual fornication, and abominations by which she dupespoliticalpowersprovesher to be a religious abominations by which she dupespoliticalpowersprovesher to be a religious power.Gp. Ezek. 23:29-31 7 Her name MYSTERY BABYLON indicates she is not Uieral Babylon.The word mystery identifies her with the religiousntesand mysteriesof ancient Babylon A ccording to Hi slop's"" The T wo Babylons"" which quotes 260 sources, the ancient Babylonian cult, started b y Nimrod and his queen, Semiramis, spread among all nations. The objects of worship were the Supreme Father, the Incarnate Female, or Queen o f Heaven, and her Son. The cult claimed the highest wisdom and the most divine secrets. Besides confession to priests there were many mysterious rites. Julius Caesarbecame head of the R07 man branch of the Babylonian Cult in 63 B.C. Other emperors held the office until 376 A.D. when the emperor Gratian, for Christian reasons refused it because he saw that Babylonianism was idolatrous. Demasus, bishop of the Christian church at Rome, was elected to the headship in 378 A.D.and from here on Babylonianism and organized Christianity became one. the rites of Babylon were soon introduced into the Christian church. Heathen temples were restored, beautified, and their rituals encouraged. Worship and veneration of images,saints,relics, private confessions, penances, scourgings, pilgrimages, sign of the cross,Christmas, Lady Day.Easter.Lent, and otha pagan rites and festivals, little by httle, became a part of Christian worship 8 The name MOTHEROF HARLOTS identifiesthe whore as a religious system (V 5). The harlots refer to many branches which have sprung from her and have become as muchapostate as the great whore herself. She is a symbol of apostate religions being linked together after the rapture of the church to dominate the 10 kingsof the Revised Roman Empire until Antichrist comes to full power over the 10 kingdoms by the middle of Daniel's 70th week (v 1, 3. 9-17) 9 The name MOTHER OF ABO MINATIONS OF THE EARTH IdenUfies her to be a religious system fostering and tolerating aU the abominations that go with idolatry and spiritual fornication. The word abominatio ns i s used manytimesof idolatry and whoredoms associated with pagan worship (Dt.18:9-12; 29:17-18: 32:16-17; 1 Ki. 14:24; 2 Ki. 16:3-4; 21:2-11; Ezek. 16: 22-58; etc.). The great whore of the future tribulation will be the mother of abominations in God's sight because she will exceed all others in wickedness 10 Her drunkenness - being drunken with blood of the martyrs of Jesus, provesbeyond doubt that she is a religious institution. Only religion has Wiled the martyrs of Jesus in all ages, Govemmentshave carried out the dictates of leaders in religion, doing the Govemmentshave carried out the dictates of leaders in religion, doing the actualkillingofsaintsbecauseof religion. Although ttiis prophecy speaks of the future drunkenness of mystical B abylon after the rapture of the church, who among us does not know of the martyrdom of 200,000, 000 people in the past because they would not conform to organized religion? 5 classes tliat have martyred saints: (1) Jews (Acts 7:61-60; 8:1: 9:1). Their religious prejudice caused many to be put to death (2) Pagans of the old Roman Empire. Historyrecordsihe martyrdom of many Chtistiansby pagan emperors because of religious differences (3) Mohammedans slew Christians in all their conquests (4) Greek Catholics have also penecuted and martyred Christians (5) Roman Catholics have been guilty of martyrdoms in many centuries and many lands Martyrdom of saints will again be revived in the old Roman Empire territory between the rapture and the 2nd advent. In the first 3 1/2 years of Daniel's 70th week, the great whore wiU murder the saintsof Jesus (17:6). In the middle of the week when Antichrist comes to power over the 10 kingdoms the great wliore will be destroyed and martyrdom of Christians will be carried on by the beast and the 10 kings until the 2nd advent (13:1-18; 14:9-11: 17:9-17: 19:11-20:6} 11 The hatred and destruction of the great whore by 10 kings inside the Roman Empireterritoryproveherto be a religious system dominating them until they cLre of her and give 5ieir power to the A ndchrist.Tliey turn on the great whore and destroy her so that the Antichrist might establish beast worsliip the last 3 1/2 years (17:12-17) 12 The woman sitsonthebeast itself, not on the heads and horns in succession (vl.3,7,15).The7headsandlO horns on the beast are a part of him and this istheonlysense in wfiich she rides the heads (v 9). Since the beast is the 8th worldempire(vll),itis clear that she is something separate from the empire, and only rides or dominates the peoples of tfiat empire. What could she b e othei than religion'' 13 The angelic explanation of the great whore proves her to be a religious system reigning over kings spiritually. TheGr.reads, ""Andthe woman whom thou system reigning over kings spiritually. TheGr.reads, ""Andthe woman whom thou sawest istheciiythegreat, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth"" (17:18).Shehasa kingdom within the kingdoms and over them. She is tobe a religious system inside the old Roman Empire territory; one that has headquaners in a great city; and one that has a religious langdom or reign over the kings of the earth We must recogni ze in the symbol two things: a great religious system and a great city where she has headquarters. The great whore will hold power over her loyal subjects, not through superior military forces, but by the deceptions of her spiritual harlotry and abominations 18 reasons Babylon the city: The above facts, together with the mysteries of the Roman part of Christendom of baptismal regeneration, supposed changing of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus Christ, holy wa fers, holy waters, lights, candles, confessions, and other ceremonies, mumbled in a language that tends to mystery, have caused the majority of Bible students in all generations to hold that Rome is the city of the prophecy. But there is another city which could be the intent of the prophecy - literal Babylon itself, for the folio wing 18 reasons: 1 Literal Babylon is definitely the subject of Rev. 16:17-21 and 18:1-24 2 Mystical Babylon is another subject inserted between these two passages, a parenthetical one to explain the religious aspect of Babylon. (See 16 contrasts between the two Babylons, note d, 18:2) 3 The fact that the great whore is called mystery Babylon proves a connection with literal Babylon (17:5) 4 Literal Babylon is the site of the first great rebellion against God after the flood of Noah (Gen. 11) and it will be the site of the last great rebellion (14:8; 16:17-21; 18:1-24) 5 Literal Babylon is always associated with demon religions and idolatry in Scripture (Isa. 21:9; 47:9-10; Rev. 18:2-3, 23) 6 Many prophecies concerning literal Babylon in both testa meats are yet unfulfilled asa,13:l-22; 14:1-27; 43: 14; 47:1-15; 48:20; Jer. 50-51; Zech. 5:5-11; Rev. 14:8; 16:17-21; 18:1-24). On the other hand,the cityof Rome is not once mentioned in any prophecy, fulfilled or unfulfilled 7 Of all the empires taking part In the times of the Gentiles - Egypt, A ssyriaj3abylon,Medo-Persia,Greece, Rome, Revised Rome and Revived Greece, the capital city of only one (Babylon) is mentioned i n prophecy with a latter day fulfillment.Memphis, Ninevah,Shushan,Rome,etc. are completely ignored in prophecy, while the capital city, Babylon is mentioned repeatedly. See scriptures under point 6 above 8 Never has itbeennecessary to re- identify any city named in prophecy. Predictions in Scripture about Sodom, identify any city named in prophecy. Predictions in Scripture about Sodom, Gomorrha, Ninevah, Tyre, Sidon and others have been fulfilled regarding the cities known by the names referred to In the various passages. Why should Babylon be an exception? The word mystery simply defines the religious aspect of the literal city - Babylon 9 Literal Babylon is the only city called the lady of kingdoms (Isa. 47: 5, 7) 10 Babylon is the only city of the last days that will be the headquarters for every demon and unclean spirit(18:2). If this be true, then Rome or no other city will be the center of false religions fulfilling prophecy 11 Babylon is the only city named making all nations drunk with the wine of her fornication (18:3). The great whore unnamed i s the only other Babylon causing nations to be drunk with the wine of her fornication, so the references must be to the same city - mystery Babylon being the religious aspect of Literal Babylon (17:2) 12 Babylonistheonlycityin the last days to be the center of sorceries, enchantments, etc. (18:23; Isa. 47:9-10, 12-13). Rome could not take Babylon's place in this 13 Babylon is the only named city singledoutastheobjectofGod's wrath and plagues (16:19; 18:4, 6). If Rome was to be the great city fulfilling such prophecy it surely would have been mentioned instead of Babylon, for Rome was weU known at the time John wrote the Revelation.The very absence of the name Rome is no mere accident. God never leaves us in doubt as to the true meaning"
Revelation,22,14,"BabylonistheonlycityGod commands His people to come out of, in the la St days(18:4; Jer.50:4-9; 51:4-8,45). The application of this to Rome cannot be proved by Scripture 15 Heaven is commanded to rejoice overthe destruction of literal Babylon because God has taken vengeance on her(18:20). This isthe same as judging the great whore o f Rev. 17, proving that the great whore or mystical Babylon is the same asllteral Babylon as far as a place or a city is concerned (19:2). The only difference is that the great whore is the reUgious aspect of the city of Babylon 16 Babylon Is the only city named which Is 10 be judged in the last days for martyrdoms (18:24). Since both mystery and literal Baoylons martyr the saints there must be some relationship. If two different cities as far from each other as Rome and Babylon were to be guilty ofthe same things after the rapture, then two places would be referred to and not one only as in 18:24 17 The 16 points of contrast, 7 points of similarity (p. 299) and 31 facts about Babylo n (p. 308) ate in harmony with the idea that the oneBabylon, a literal city, is the headquarters of the other, mystery Babylon, a religious system 18 Antichrist will be king of Syria with Babylonashis capital (Isa. 14:4). This wiU fulfil Dan. 8:8-9,20-25:11: 35-45. The great whore will ride the beast fulfil Dan. 8:8-9,20-25:11: 35-45. The great whore will ride the beast (Antichrist's kingdom) in his rise to power overthe 10 kingdoms(17:3,7), It should be recognized then, that die symbolizes a religion in his capital even before he gets power over the 10 kingdoms of Revised Rome(17:12-17) What religion is symbolized by the great whore with headquarters at Babylon? Could apostate Christendom have headquarters inBabylon? That is possible, but not probable due to the fact that the religion predicted is anti-Christian. Could it be Mohammedanism,the religion of the eastern pan of the Roman Empire territory? It could be as there ate about 416,600,000 Moslems compared to 480,000,000 Roman Catholics in the world.Moslems control the northern part of Africa, including Egypt, all of Arabia, Trans-Jordan, Syria, Irak, Iran, Turkey and other parts of the old Roman Empire territory. Catholicism is the prevailing religion in A Ibania 3 ulgaria .Romania, Yugo-slavia, Hungary, Austria, luly, Spainj'ortugal,France,andsome other parts of the old Roman Empire territory. Between the two religions most of the old Roman Empire territory is covered religiously, but this does not prove a thing regarding crfyStery Babylon of Rev. 17 [J Babylon's could bea new religion entirely, or a revival of ancient sorcery, witchcraft, enchantments, and astrology which characterized the ancient city. It is clear that such will be the prevailing religion ofthe whole Roman Empire territory in the last days, as in point 12, above Jesus predicted many false prophets who would show great signs and wonders to deceive men just prior to His coming to eanhagain(Mt.24:24). Paul predicted the coming of Antichrist with allpower,agns, and lying wonders by the power of Satan (2 Thf 2:8-12; Rev. 13:1-18; 19:20). All nations wiU be deceived by the sorceriesand manifestations of demon powers concentrated in future literal Babylon (Rev. 9: 20; 14:8; 16:13-16, 19: 18:23; Isa. 47:9-10, 12-13) If Antichrist can start a religion and martyr millions during the last 3 1/2 yearsofthisage(Rev. 7:9-17; 13:1-18; 14:9-11:16:2,6; 16:13-16; 19:20; 20: 4-6), then itstandsto reason that mystery Babylon as a revival of ancient magism backed by a concentration of demon powers dominating the nations oftheold Roman Empire territory from Babylon could martyr many saints of Jesus during the first 3 1/2 years of Daniel's 70th week and untilAntichrist comes to full power over the 10 kingdoms of Revised Rome (Rev. 17:1-2, 5-6, 12-17) As to Catnolicism and Mohammedanism,both these religions would have to change completely to fulfil prophecies of these events. Neither religion Is anti-God One thing seems certain - mystery and literal Babylons are two aspects of the samecityandpowerthat will fulfil prophecyin die last days after the rapture of the church. Mystery Babylon is a religious system with headquarters in literal Babylon and wiU fulfil Rev. 17 until Antichrist comes to full power overthe 10kingdoms of Revised Rome in the until Antichrist comes to full power overthe 10kingdoms of Revised Rome in the middle of Daniel's 70th week (Rev. 17:12-17). Then Antichrist, who will be king of Babylon (Isa. 14:4) and the A ssynan (isa. 10:20-27; 30:18-33; 31:4-32:20; Mic. 5:3-15), wiU destroy this religious system and stan his own worship the last 3 1/2 years of this age (13:1-18; 14:8-11; 15:2-4; 16:2, 6; 17:12-17; 20:4-6) One thing must be kept in mind, all these events will take place after the rapture of the church, so mystery Babylon need not be some religion now prominent inside the Roman Empire territory any mote than the religion Antichrist wQl start must be some prominent religion now in existence. Religions can begin in one day and so it will be easy for two religions (Antichrist's andBabylon's)bothto start and martyr millions between the rapture and the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ NOTES ON REVELATION CONTINUED 7 headed 10 homed beast (17:8^ The beast is a symbol of 3 things: 1 A supernatural angel out of the abyss, as required in points 1-6 below 2 A rnortal man, as proved in points 7-46 below 3 A kingdom, as proved in points 47-60 below NIany fallacies ha ve come by not recognizing all 3 thi«gs in the samesy^-boL Some passages apply to all three: some to only one 60 facts coDceming the beast: 6 tacts - the beast out of the .'byss: 1 Comesoutoftheabyss(ll; 7:17:8) 2 .ViU war on the 2 witnesses (11:7) 3 Will finaUy kiU the.~ (11:7) 4 Once lived out of the abyss (17:8) 5 Was in the abyssin John's Jay (17: 6 WillgointoperditioiK17:8) 8) 40 facts - the beast out of the sea: 7 WiU be a man (13:1. 18) 8 Has 7 syrriBoirc heads (13:1: 17: 3-11) 3 Has names of blasphemy (13:1; 17:3) 10 Ha5l0hDms;10crowns(13:l;17:3) 11 Is like a leopard, a symbol of the Grecian Empire (13:2; 17:3; Dan. 7:6) 12 Has the feet of a bear, a symbol of Medo-Persia (13:2; Dan. 7:5) 13 Has the mouth of a lioi», a symbol of Babylon (13:2; Dan, 7:4)"

A kingdom could not possibly come from such a place. This would mean that every person in the original kingdom would come back to live on earth again. This is not taught ofonehum.anbeing in Scripture, much less of thousands of people coming out to carryon with their originalUves and kingdom. If only a person can be refened to, then it must be either an angel or a hu—jan being who is no w confined to the abyss and -iU come out to fulflU this prophecy. It is not necessary to hold that the bea st of the abyss must be a man brought back from, the dead, or that the beastout of the abyss andthebeastoutofthe sea must bethe same person 2 The Antichrist or beast out of the sea of humanity miust be an orJinary mortal because he wlU die at Armageddon (Dan, 7:11; 8:8, 22, 25; 2 Th. 2:8-9; Rev. 19:20). This would be impossible if he were some roan resurrected and made imm.ortal during his second Ufetim.e on earth 3 The doctrine of a resurrection of any man from corruption to become a mortalagain anddieagain on earthin his second lifetime is not taught in Scripture(Heb.9:27). Judas, Antiochus Epiphanes, or no other man is an exception to the law of dying only once and after this the judgment .One does not have to make the Bible conuadict itself in order to find an explanation of aU facts 4 ThedocttiDe of a re-incantation is not oiKe mentioned in Scripture,so this would be im. possible for any hum an being who evetUvedonearth(Heb. 9:27; Rev. 20:11-15). To be re-incamated one would have to be bom again in the flesh as a baby.grow to maturity, and go through every process in his previous lifetime. This is utterly unscriptural. The next time men are to live in bo dies is in the remrrection when their own grown bodies will be brought fonh (Dan. 12:2: Jn. 5:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:20-58; 1 Th. 4:16;Phil.3:21;Rev.20:11-15) 5 The abyss is not the place of confinement for humanbeings who die in theit one and only mortal lifetim.e. It is a place forconfinementof demons and certain faUen angels (Lk. 8:31; Rev. 9: 1-21; 11:7; 17:8; 20:3,7). Human souls that ate righteous go to heaven at death"
Revelation,22,2,"Cor.5:8; PhiL 1:21-24; Heb. 12:23; Rev.6:9-ll),The wicked go to heU(Lk. 16:19-31;Rev.20:ll-15,notes).Therefore, no human being could ever come out of the abyss as the Antichrist 6 There is no scripture to prove that Antichrist wiU be different from any other natural man in his lifetime as to his birth, death, etc. He wiU merely be used by satanic powers in the last days.It is not necessary forGod or Satan to caU anyone back from the dead to fulfiU any purpose on earth. If some man in hi story could fulfiU the prophecies then some man who has never died can fulfiU them. No re-incama-tion or resurrectionhasbeen necessary for the operation of supernatural powers ofeitherGodorSatan at any time. The only thing necessary is the complete yieldedness to the operator 7 That the Antichrist wiU be assassinated in the middle of Daniel's 70th week and then rise from the dead as an immortal being and an incarnation ol Satan is unscriptwal. The head wornd-ed to death and revived again has no reference to Antichrist, but to one of the heads on the beast, which are aU kingdoms and not menfl7:9-11).The Antichrist ismerelythenumanheadof the 8th kingdom. He is not any one of the 7 hea js or 10 hoins.T hey symbolize other things before he even com,es (Dan.7:23-24:Rev.l7:9-ll).A ntichrist wUl never be an incarnation of Satan, for we see the dragon as a separate person from the beast in aU Scripture (2 Th.2:8-9; Rev. 13:1-18; 16:13-16: 20: 10). Satan is an angel with his own body and could never be on the inside of any man boiily (note n, Lk. 22:3) Beast out of the abyss identified : The beast out of the abyss is a sacanic angel and not the human spirit of som e dead man. He does not incarnate himself in the hu.man Antichrist or beast outof the sea,but merely uses him as a tool to re'^ ive the -Sth or Grecian kiiy-dom. as the 3ih and last kingdom in iS"" times of the Gentiles. This spirit ruled the old Grecian Empire, the 3th of the 5 kingdoms that had faUen before John's day (17:10). .yhen his kingdom feU he was confined to the abyss where he remained during the 6th kingdom (theRomanEmpire, whichwas the one in existence in Jota's day) and where he has been ever since. He wiU be confined to the abyss until the 10 kingdoms are form, ed inside the Roman Empire to miake the 7tfa kingdom of 17:10.He wiU then be loosed ana use the A ntichrist to revive the olc Grecian Empire as the Sth kingdom of 17:11 This is what the angel meant wbeahe saij the beast was(had existed on earth before John's Jay), and is not (on the earth in John's day); and shaU ascend out of the abyss and go to perdition (17:8) Kingdom/s of this world have always beencontroUedbygodlyor satanic angels and warson earth are Icstot won as a result ofba tiles in the heavenUes between the good and bad angels. God plans the rise and faUof certain kingdom,s and Satan seeks to keep the prophetic ^Jotd from, coming to pa ss (lsa.24:21-23; 25:7;Dan.lO: 13-21: 11: l;12:l;Eph.6:12;Rev. 12:7-^2;16:13-16).InD3n.l0:12-21; 12:1 wehavethe satanic prince of Persia, the prince of Gtecia, Michael, Israel's prince, and other angeUc rulers mentioned He is the prince of Grecia because: 1 The last visions ot Daniel concern the Grecian Emipire, its 4 diviaons, and the rise of A ntictaist out of one of them (8:9. 20-25; 11:1-45) 2 The A ntichrist, the earthlyheadof the Sth kingdom (which is a revival of the 5th kingdom that had faUen before John'sday-17:10). will come from the Syrian division of the old Grecian tm-pire(Dan.8:9,20-25; 11:36-45, notes). If he co,yesfrom theold Grecian Empire and revives it, then it is definite that the spirit out of the abyss is the prince of Grecia of Dan. 10:20 3 In Dan. 7:23-24 a ntichrist uses one of the 10 kingdoms, the Syrian kingdom, to overthrow 3 others, that is, the others divisions of the old Grecian Empire of Dan. 8:9,20-25. This points to the prince of Grecia as the beast out of the abyss 4 The bodyofthe beast of Revelation is like a leopard( 13:2), which, in Dan-iel 7:6, symbolizes the old Grecian Empire, proving that the kingdom of Antichrist wUl be mainly Grecian in character andpoUcy, as the Syrian division in Dan,8:9- 14,20-25; 11:21-45. This identifies the beastoftlieabyss as the prince of Grecia 5 Injoel3:6wiihZech. 9;13we have prophecies of the Grecian Empire in the last days under A ntichrist, proving beyond doubt that the prince of Gtecia is the spirit of the abyss.

The words Egypt and Egypliap are used 731 times in Scripture and in nearly every case with Israel. Even until the Roman Empire"" days, Egypt was Israel's bitter enemy, with the exception of a few periods of friendship. Egypt was the place where Israel became a nation and where they were oppressed over 30 years before Moses led them out of bondage (Gen. 15:13-14; Gen. 37 through Ex. i5).Sheis mentioned many times after this as the oppressor of Israel {1 Ki.l4; 2 Ki. 17: 13:21-19:38; 23:23-37;"
Revelation,22,32,"V A fter having oppressed Israel off ana on for over 3,750 years, Egypt will be subject to Antichrist in oppressingihem again under the 3th kingdom (Dan. 3:21-25; 11:40- 45), She will never be a great world power again (Ezek. 29:15), but will serve the Lord along with Israel in the eternal kingdom (Isa.11:11-16; 19: 23-25; 27:12-13; Zech. 10:10-11; 14:16-21). See note c, Ps. 30:13 2 Assyria was the second great empire to oppress Israel in the_times_ofihe Gentiles .FoundedbyNimrod(Gen. 10: ' 3-12) it was a kingdom inferior to Egypt for 1,300 years. Then God al-i lowed her to chasten Israel (2 Ki. 15-16; 17-19; 23-24). The words A ssyria and A ssyrian are used 175 times and nearly always in CQnnection with Is- ' rael. She oppressed Israel off and on for about 175 years. Antic.rist will be trie last Assyrian to oppress Israel in the times of the Gentiles (Isa. 10:20-27; 14:25; 31:4-9; Mic. 5: 5-6). A ssyria will be blessed in the eternal kingdom along with Israel (Isa. 11:16; 19:23-25). See note c, Ps. 80:13 3 Babylon was the third empire to oppress Isra el in the ri m es of the G entiles. It isthe firstone mentioned in Daniel, and for this reason many Bible scholars start the times of the Gentiles with Babylon. But it must be remembered that both Egypt and A ssyria persecuted Israel before Babylon and much longer. ,vhy start the times of the Gentiles with the third empire to oppress Israel merely because Daniel saw those times from Us day forward'? He naturally could not predict the oppressions o f Israel b y Egypt and Assyria for they were in the past by the time he lived. Nevertheless, were they not oppressions by the Gen-ales'"" If so, then they rightly belong to the times of the Gentiles. Daniel saw them from his day forward, while John saw the whole length of the times of the Gentiles from Egypt to the Revised Roman Empire, the purpose being to identify the 3th kingdom that will complete the tim«s of the Gentiles Babylon as an inferior"

The word Ba pylon is used 284 times m Scripture nearly always in connection with israeL She will have a laner day part in oppressing Israel (Isa. 13-14; Jer. 50-51). See p. 308-309 4 Medo-Persia was the 4th empire to oppress Israel in the times of the Gentiles. It is the 2nd one in Daniel as the breast and arms of silver(2:32,39),the bear(7:5),andtheram (8:20). It is referred to only 53 linresin Scnpture, but in an"

It will fulfill prophecy in the last days under Antichrist (Ezek. 38-39).Medo-Persia persecuted Israel off and on for over 100 years. See note c, Ps. 30.13 5 Greece was the 5th empire to oppress Israel in thetimesof theGentiles and the 3rd one Ln Daniel. It is sym^bolized in Daniel by the belly and thighs of brass(2:32, 33), as the leopard (7:6), and as the he-goat (8:5-9,20-25).It is only mentioned by name 9 times in Scripture, due to the fact it existed between the Old and New Testament times. Sheis mentioned manytimes in the books of Maccabees in the Apocrypha. Practically aU of Dan. 8, 11 an d 12: Rev. 6:1-3; 13:1-13; 17:9-17: 19: 19-21 must be understood in connection with Greece which will be revived again as the ^th kingdom. Greece and the Syrian and Egyptian parts of the empire persecuted laaeloff andon for over 250 yean. The Grecian empire is the 5thhead on the beast of Rev. 17:9-11, which was (before John), is not (In john'sday),andbecomes revived as me 8th and last kingdom to oppress IsraeL She is the head that was wounded to death and madeaUve again (13:3,12) 6 Rom e was the 6th empire to oppress Israel in the times of theGentil (13:3,12) 6 Rom e was the 6th empire to oppress Israel in the times of theGentil es and the 4th in Daniel. It is symbolized in Daniel as the legs ofiron (2:33,40), the non-descript beast (7:7-3, 23-24), and tne 6th head on t.e beast (Rev.l7:9-17). Rome oppressed Israel over 200 years and dispersed the Jews, 70 A. D. (Dan. 9:26-27; Mt. 24:1-3; Lk. 21:20-24. notes). It is from this territory that the next two kingdoms will arise 7 Revised Rome will be the next em-pire m entioned in Scripture as oppress-inglsrael in the times of the Gentiles. Thi' kingdom will be made up ot 10 kingdoms inside t he Roman Empire territory in the last da ys. For this rea son we caU it the Revised Roman Empire, not the Revived. It the Roman Empire were to be revived it would be one kingdom mledby one man from Rome, butinstead 10 separate kingdoms ruled by 10 kings and with 10 separate capitals wUl be formed inside the Roman i Empire territory. This is symboUzed in j Danielbythe 10toes(2:40-45) and 10 i horns (7; 7-8, 19-24), and by 10 horns in Rev. 12:3; 13:1; 17:9-17 | 10 proofs toes and horns the same: (1) The number is the samie (12:3: 13:1; 17:12: Dan. 2:40-45; 7:7-27) (2) They all exist together and fight Christ at Armageddon (17:14; 19:11- 21:Dan.2:34-35,44-45: 7:3-14,21-27) (3) They all exist after Rome and are a revision of it (17:12-17; Dan, 2:44-45: 7:7-3, 23-24) (4) They will aUbe connected with the same beast at the same time (17: 12-17; 19:19-21; Dan. 7:8,11,21-27) (5) The little horn of Dan.7:7-8,19-24, and the beast of Rev. 17:9-17 are the same and will arise after the 10 kings and from among them (17:12-17; Dan. 7:7-8, 23-24) (6) They willbecome subject to the same man at the same time (13:1-8; 17:12-17; Dan. 7:23-24) (7) The kingdom of God and Christ wiUbe set up in the days of their existence (17:14; 19:11-21; Dan. 2:44-45: 7:7-27) (8) They will give their power to the same manforthe samelength of time (13:5; 17:3-17; Dan. 7:23-25; 12:7) (9) The 10 horns are the same astne 7ihkiiigdom of Rev.l7:8-17.They succeed the 6th kingdom ot Rome and precede the 3th or the Antichrist kingdom (17:8- the 6th kingdom ot Rome and precede the 3th or the Antichrist kingdom (17:8- 17). The 10 toes and 10 horns of Dan. 2:40-45; 7:7-3,23-24 also come out of Rome, succeed Rome and precede the kingdom of the little horn or the Antichrist kingdom. Hence, they must be the same (10) The 10 horns in both books reign both before and a fter the beast or Utile horn. Their reign before him is different from that after him. Before he comestheyare independent, but after he comes to power they are subject to him. They control the 7th; he controls the8thkingdom.Therefore,tney must be the same 8 Revived Greece w ill be die 2nd of the future empires to oppress Israel in the times of tiie Gentiles and the last world powet to do so. Antichrist will come out of the 10 kingdoms and overthrow 3 of them. The others wUI submit to him thus formiing the 8th kingdom (Dan. 7:23-24; Rev. 17:8-17). It wtU be defeated byChrist at His second advent. This will end the times of the Gentiles The Millennium (20:6): 50 points about the Millennium: 1 DeStation . Latin . miUe, a thousand ,153152^ year. The phrase thousand years is used 6 times in 20:1-7 2 It is the last aispensation for man before the final removal of the curse (22:3) In Scripture it is called : (1) The thousand years reign of Christ (20:2, 4, 5, 6, 7) (2) The dispensation of the fulness of Draes(Eph, 1:10) (3) Thedayof the Lord(seep.226, col. 4).

T. church 3 It is not the whole N.T. church 4 It is not the 144, 000 Jews 5 It is not the tribulation saints 6 It is not any single individual or any one special group of individuals oui of the redeemed 7 It is not any one denominarion or all the denominations combined What the bride of Christ is: It is "" that geat city , the holy Jerusalem"" (V 2,9-1 Oy This is what the angel pointed out to John when he promised to show him the bride, the Lamb's wife - the Holy City, the heavenly Jerusalem. What a simple revelation! It is unscriptural to speak of any one companyofredeemedasbeingthe exclusive bride of Christ, If the city, the New Jerusalem, is the bride, then all who go to live in the Holy City mal<e up the bride and not just a part of them A11 redeemed will live in the city: 1 The O.T. saints were promised the New Jerusalem (Heb, 11:10-16) 2 The early church was promised the city(jn. 14:1-3: Heb. 13:14) 3 EveryChristian is promised the city (Rev. 3:12: jn. 14:1-3; Heb. 12:23) 4 The 144,000 Jews will b e there (Rev. 7:1-8: 12:5: 14:1-5) 5 The tribulation saints will go there (Rev. 6:9-11: 7:9-17; 15:2-4: 20:4-6j Therefore, we conclude that since all saints in the first resurrection (from Abel to the la St one saved in the future tribulation) will go to live in the New Jerusalem that all such saints will be members of the bride. No one person, group of persons, denomination, mansion, temple or any other building can be called the city, the Lamb's wife. It takes all to be the city - the bride It would be scriptural, however, to say concerning the redeemed,that they are now married to Christ under the terms of the new covenant, that they are citizens of heaven,that they have a hope of going to live in the New Jerusalem, and that because of this they expect to bea partofthebrideofchrist or a part of the heavenly city. But no one is actually a part of the bride until he begins to Uve in the city, which is the bride, the Lamb's wife (v 9-10) Students forcenturieshave called the church the bride of Christ but thisis unscriptural. The church will become a part of the bride when its membersbe-gintolive in the New Jerusalem but it will not be the exclusive bride of Christ, aU the redeemed of all other ages will also be a pan of the bride (V 9-10) The wife of Christ (21:9): Gr, gune , a woman, married or un-marned; a wife. Trans, woman 129 times and wife 92times. That it refers to single women and widows as well as married women is clear from Lk, 4:26; 10:38;jn.l9:26; 20:11-15:1 Tim,5:2, 14. Therefore, the theory based upon ; this word that Israel is the bride of Christ because she is miarricd to God is ] not proved.The Gr.for bride is numphe. , It is trans , bride (jn. 3:29; Rev. 18:23; | 21:2, 9; 22:17) and daughter-in-law (Mt. 10:35: Lk» 12:53). The wife or bride here is the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, and is the same as the wife in 19:7, which is the redeemed of all ages who wUlhave part in the first resurrection and who will live in the New Jerusalem forever. Just because the wife of 19:7is not called a bride is no proof that she is not a bride. Are not all women who marry called brides'!' It is true that Israel is married to God (see p, 307, col. 1), but this is no proof that she is the wife and bride of Rev, 19:7; 21:2, 9; 22:17 8 proofs the Church is now married: 1 Jesus called Himself the bridegroom of Christians (Mt. 9:15; Mk. 2:19-20: Lk. 1 Jesus called Himself the bridegroom of Christians (Mt. 9:15; Mk. 2:19-20: Lk. 5:34-35) 2 John called Christ the bridegroom fJn.3:29).TheGr. word for brideyoom in all these passages is numpmos , a newly married man 3 Christians are married to God and Christ underthe terms of the N. T. as Israel was married to God underthe terms of the O.T. (Mt.26:28; Lk. 22: 20; 2 Cor. 3: Heb. 12:24) 4 Paul taught fliat Christians are married to Christ by the new covenant (Rom. 7:1-6) 5 Paul taught that O. T. saints will notbe perfected apart from N.T. saints fHeb.ll:40).This means that all will De perfected together as those who make the inhabitants of the New Jerusalem, the Lamb's wife 6 Jesus in Rev. 22:16-17, after the ascension, recognized that believers on earth were already His bride or were to be a part of Ftts bride 7 Paul in ICor. 11:3; 12:12-28; Eph, 4:12-16; 5:25- 33 used the marriage relationship to illustrate and teach the relationship of Christ to His church, proving Christians are now married to Christ 8 Paul taught that believers ate now joined to the Lord or married to Him in one Spirit, as Israel was in the O.T. days (Isa. 56:6; Jet, 50:5) Marriage of Christ completed It is clear from the above that Christians are now married to Christ. It is also clear from 2 Cor. ll:l-21:Rev. 19: 1-10that they are to have final marriage festivities. The seeming difference maybe explained by Hebrew custom (note a, Mt. 1:18). The betrothed parties were legallyin the position of a married couple and unfaithfulness in this period was adultery(Dt. 22:23; Mt, 1:19). The concluding festivities took place at the actual time of coming together as man and wife at which time a marriage supper wasgiven. The marriage was consummated by entrance into the wedding chamber. The marriage supper of the Lamb in Rev. 19 is simply the concluding ceremony, not the marriage contract entered into at conversion 7 ""new"" things in Revelation: (2llS) 1 Newnameforovercomers(2:l7; 3: 2 Newnamefot Christ (3:12) 12) 3 New Jerusalem (3:12; 21:2) 4 New songs (5:9: 14:3) 5 New Heaven (21:1; 2 Pet. 3:13) 5 New Heaven (21:1; 2 Pet. 3:13) 6 New Earth (21:1: Isa. 65:17: 66:22) 7 All things new, referring to the renewal of the heavens and earth and all things previously cursed (21:1-22:5) 21 other ""new "" things in Rev, 21-22: 1 New city on earth (v 2-3,10-27) 2 New and visible presence of God the Father on earth (v 3-7; 22:3-5) 3 New earth conditions (v 4-7) 4 New water of life for all men on earth (V 6: 22:1, 17) 5 New realization o f eternal i n-heritances for all men (v 7) 6 Ne w segregation between godly and ungodly (V 8-27:22:15;Isa,66:22)- 7 New and eternal relationship (21: 3-10, 24-27; 22:1-5) 8 New eternal generations of natural people (V 3-7,24-27; 11:15; 22:4-5: Gen. 8:22: 9:12; 13:15; 17:7,19: Ex. 3:15: Dt. 5:29; 29:29; 2 Sam, 7:24-26; 1 Chr. 23:25;Ps. 45:17: 72:5; 89:4; 102: 12,24:106:31; 145:13; 146:10: Isa. 9: 6-7; 51:8: 59:21; Jer, 31:35-36; 32:38-40;Ezek.37:24-28: 43:7; Dan, 2:44-45; 7:13-14, 18, 27; L k, 1:32-33, 55: Heb. 12:28) 9 New traffic in the new city (v 24— 10 New river on earth (22:1) 27j 11 New food for the new natural people (22:1-2, 14) 12 New and eternal health (22:1-14) 13 New earth inhabitants - the resurrected people residing in the new Jerusalem (21:2, 9-10: 22:1-5) 14 New location for the capital of the universe (21:2, 9-10, 24-27: 22:4-5) 15 New method of livingforever (22: 16 New kinds of fruit (22:2) 2) 17 New and eternal King and kingdom on earth(21:3-7: 22:1-5) 18 New unity between heaven and earth(21:3-7,24-27; 22:3; Eph. 110) 19 New and eternal responsibility of man in carrying out the original plan (21:3- 7, 24-27; 22:1-5; Isa. 45:18; Gen. 1:26-28) 20 New future for natural and resurrected men (21:3-7, 24-27: 22:1-5: Eph. 2:7) 21 New and eternal tealization o f God's plan for man fulfilled (21:2-7, 24-27; 22:1-5) NOTES ON REVELATION CONTINUED 313 Restitution of all things (Acts 3:21): The fallof mandoesnot do away with the original plan to replenish the earth with natural people.

A fable is a story or account, especially a fictitious narrative feigned or invented to instruct or amuse, a tale devised to enforce some truth or precept, or to introduce indirectly some opinion, in which imaginary persons or beings as well as animals and even inanimate things are represented as speakers and actors.The minds of Orientals were full of fables; they spoke of beasts, trees, rocks, and other lower forms of creation as If they they spoke of beasts, trees, rocks, and other lower forms of creation as If they possessed human characteristics. Fables rejected by N, T. teaching were the legends,myths,and falsehoods developed perhaps by popular fancy or siiperstition, and such stories as had been fabricated to deceive. The interpretation of (acceptable) fables and allegories must not be carried too far; that Is, details must not be stressed. Only the main lessons must be emphasized - the lessons made clear in the nanatives,as in those of Jotham (Judg. 9:7-20) and Jehoash (2 Ki. 14:9). See Allegory Face (401). Used 12 ways in Scripture: TOf the literalface (Gen.3:19;43:3; Mt. 6:17; Rev. 4:7; 22:4; Jas.l:23) 2 Surface of the eanh (Gen. 1:2, 29; 2:6: 6:1, 7; 7:3-4, 23; 8:9) 3 BodIlypresence(Gen.4:14;Ex.lO:28) 4 Seeking the face, meaning to seek the audience and favor of God or man (Ps. 24:6; 27:8; 105:4; Pr. 7:15) 5 Hiding the face, meaning to with-drawfavor(Dt. 32:20;Job34:29; Ps. 13:1; 30:7; 143:7; Isa.54:8; Jer.33:5) 6 Asking God to hide His face, meaning to overlook (Ps. 51:9) 7 Man hiding the face, signifying humility and reverence (Ex. 3:6; 1 Ki. 19:13) 8 Covering the face with fatness - a sign of prosperity (Job 15:27) 9 A man covering the face of another -a sign of doom, as if he were dead already (Esther 7:8) 10 Turning away the face - a sign of rejection Oer.2:27; 18:17; 32:33) 11 Hardening the face, meaning to harden self against mercy (Pr.21:29) 12 Being afraid of a face, meaning to be afraid of the person himself (Dt. 1:17) When God's face is referred to as being seen, or men are spoken of as speak -ing with Him face to face, it should be understood in the same literal way as we understand like statements regarding men having such experiences with men (Gen. 32:30; Ex. 33:11; Num, 14: 14; Dt. 34:10; Judg. 6:22; Rev. 22:4.

It swept over the church from Syria to Gaul like an epidemic and caused much confusion among Christians from the 1st to the 6th century j main points of gposticism: 1 A claim to a higher and special knowledge of truth, a tendency to regard knowledge as si5)eriorto faith, and an insight into new light which the ordinary believer did not possess 2 The separation of m.atter and qjirit, the flesh being essentially sinful and the source of all evil 3 The attempt in solving the problems of creation, and the origin of evil by a creator as being distinct from the Supreme God 4 A denial of the true humanity of Jesus Christ, looking upon the life of Christ, and especially His sufferings on the cross as unreal 5 A denial of the personality of the Si5)reme God 6 A denial of tiie free wUl of man I 7 A claim that spiritual communion withGod is attained through asceticinr. or denial of pleasures and comforts of life; on the othei hand, an indifference to sin leading to failure and licentiousness 8 A combination of certain Christian doctrines with various pagan philosophies to lone down the distinction between them. This appealed to many in the church who were dissatisfied with the simplicity of the gospel 9 The O.T.Scriptures were tiie product of the Inferior creator of the world, who was the God of the Jews, but not the true and Supreme God It is regretuble that some parts of gnosticism are fostered by certain elements of the church today.

The historic designation of the Roman Catholic dogma and unfortunate fallacy invented by Pope Pius IX, Dec. 8, 1854, that Marywasbom and preserved free from all stain of original sin.Thisis absolutely false and contrary to Scripture which declares that ALL have sinned (Rom, 3: 23; 5:12-21), and to the fact that Mary herself claimed God was her Saviour (Lk.l:47). Mary had a human father and wasbom in sin like all others.
