Matthew,8,25,"The disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!” 26“You of little faith,” Jesus replied, “why are you so afraid?” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was perfectly calm."
Matthew,8,27,"The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey Him!” The Demons and the Pigs (Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39)"

Matthew,8,30,In the distance a large herd of pigs was feeding.
Matthew,8,31,"So the demons begged Jesus, “If You drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.” 32“Go!” He told them. So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters."
Matthew,8,33,"Those tending the pigs ran off into the town and reported all this, including the account"

Matthew,9,2,"Just then, some men brought to Him a paralytic lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.”"
Matthew,9,3,"On seeing this, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!”"
Matthew,9,4,"But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, “Why do you harbor evil in your hearts?"
Matthew,9,5,"Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’"
Matthew,9,6,But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...” Then He said

Matthew,9,14,"At that time, John’s disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast so often, but Your disciples do not fast?”"

Matthew,13,14,In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled: ‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
Matthew,13,15,"For this people’s heart has grown callous; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.’b"

Matthew,13,49,"So will it be at the end of the age: The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous, 50and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Matthew,13,51,"Have you understood all these things?” “Yes,” they answered."

Matthew,21,1,"As they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent out two disciples. 2“Go to the village ahead of you,” He told them, “and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to Me."
Matthew,21,3,"If anyone questions you, tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.”"
Matthew,21,4,"This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: 5“Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘See, your King comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.’”a"
Matthew,21,6,So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.
Matthew,21,7,"They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them."
Matthew,21,8,"A massive crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road."

Matthew,21,19,"Seeing a fig tree along the road, He went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. “May you never bear fruit again!” He said. And immediately the tree withered."
Matthew,21,20,"When the disciples saw this, they marveled and asked, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” 21“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and"

Matthew,21,23,"When Jesus returned to the temple courts and began to teach, the chief priests and elders of the people came to Him. “By what authority are You doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave You this authority?” 24“I will also ask you one question,” Jesus replied, “and if you answer Me, I will tell you"
Matthew,21,25,"What was the source of John’s baptism? Was it from heaven or from men?” They deliberated among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why"

There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’ 29‘I will not,’ he replied. But later he changed his mindi and went."

Matthew,21,33,"Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he rented it out to some tenants and went away on a journey."
Matthew,21,34,"When the harvest time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his"
Matthew,21,35,"But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one, killed another, and stoned a third."
Matthew,21,36,"Again, he sent other servants, more than the first group. But the tenants did the same to them."

Matthew,21,38,"But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let"
Matthew,21,39,And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
Matthew,21,40,"Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those tenants?” 41“He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they declared, “and will rent out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his fruits in their seasons.”"
Matthew,21,42,"Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This is from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’j?"

Matthew,22,1,"Once again, Jesus spoke to them in parables: 2“The kingdom of heaven is like a king"
Matthew,22,3,"He sent his servants to call those he had invited to the banquet, but they refused to come."
Matthew,22,4,"Again, he sent other servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fatlings have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’"
Matthew,22,5,"But they paid no attention and went away, one to his field, and another to his business."
Matthew,22,6,"The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them."
Matthew,22,7,The king was enraged. He sent his troops to destroy those murderers and burn their city.
Matthew,22,8,"Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited were"
Matthew,22,9,Go therefore to the crossroads and invite to the banquet as many as you can find.’
Matthew,22,10,"So the servants went out into the streets and gathered everyone they could find, both evil and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests."
Matthew,22,11,"But when the king came in to see the guests, he spotted a man who was not dressed in wedding clothes. 12‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ But the man was speechless."

Matthew,22,14,"For many are called, but few are chosen.” Paying Taxes to Caesar (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:19-26)"
Matthew,22,15,Then the Pharisees went out and plotted to trap Jesus in His words.
Matthew,22,16,"They sent their disciples to Him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that You are honest and that You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You defer to no"
Matthew,22,17,"So tell us what You think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”"
Matthew,22,18,But Jesus was aware of their evil motives. “You hypocrites!” He said. “Why are you
Matthew,22,19,"Show Me the coin used for the tax.” And they brought Him a denarius.a 20“Whose likeness is this,” He asked, “and whose inscription?” 21“Caesar’s,” they answered. So Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”"
Matthew,22,22,"And when they heard this, they were amazed. So they left Him and went away. The Sadducees and the Resurrection (Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40)"

Matthew,22,27,"And last of all, the woman died."
Matthew,22,28,"In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For all of them were married to her.”"
Matthew,22,29,"Jesus replied, “You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures or the power"
Matthew,22,30,"In the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage. Instead,"
Matthew,22,31,"But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God said to you: 32‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?’c He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”"

Matthew,22,34,"And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they themselves"

Matthew,26,1,"When Jesus had finished saying all these things, He told His disciples, 2“You know that the Passover begins in two days, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”"
Matthew,26,3,"At that time, the chief priests and elders of the people assembled in the courtyard of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, 4and they conspired to arrest Jesus covertly and kill Him. 5“But not during the feast,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.” Jesus Anointed at Bethany (Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8)"
Matthew,26,6,"While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the leper,a 7a woman came to Him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume, which she poured on His head as He reclined at the table."
Matthew,26,8,"When the disciples saw this, they were indignant and asked, “Why this waste?"
Matthew,26,9,"This perfume could have been sold at a high price, and the money given to the poor.”"

Matthew,26,16,So from that time on Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus. Preparing the Passover (Psalm 41:1-13; Mark 14:12-21; Luke 22:7-13; John 13:18-30)
Matthew,26,17,"On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?”"

Matthew,26,19,So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.

Matthew,26,21,"And while they were eating, He said to them, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray Me.”"
Matthew,26,22,"They were deeply grieved and began to ask Him one after another, “Surely not I, Lord?”"
Matthew,26,23,"Jesus answered, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with Me will betray"
Matthew,26,24,"The Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed. It would be better for him if he had not been born.”"

Matthew,26,32,"But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”"
Matthew,26,33,"Peter said to Him, “Even if all fall away on account of You, I never will.” 34“Truly I tell you,” Jesus declared, “this very night before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”"
Matthew,26,35,"Peter replied, “Even if I must die with You, I will never deny You.” And the rest of the disciples said the same. Jesus Prays at Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46)"
Matthew,26,36,"At that time Jesus went with His disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and He told them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”"
Matthew,26,37,And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful
Matthew,26,38,"Then He said to them, “My soul is consumed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me.”"
Matthew,26,39,"Going a little farther, He fell facedown and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You will.”"
Matthew,26,40,"Then Jesus returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. “Were you not able to keep watch with Me for one hour?” He asked Peter. 41“Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”"
Matthew,26,42,"A second time He went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I"
Matthew,26,43,Again Jesus returned and found them sleeping—for their eyes were heavy.

Matthew,26,46,"Rise, let us go! See, My betrayer is approaching!” The Betrayal of Jesus (Mark 14:43-52; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:1-14)"
Matthew,26,47,"While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people."

Matthew,26,56,But this has all happened so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled. Jesus Faces the Sanhedrin (Isaiah 53:1-8; Mark 14:53-65; John 18:19-24; 1 Peter 2:21-25)
Matthew,26,57,"Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest,"
Matthew,26,58,"But Peter followed Him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. And he went in and sat down with the guards to see the outcome."
Matthew,26,59,The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus
Matthew,26,60,"But they could not find it, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward 61and said, “This man declared, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”"
Matthew,26,62,"So the high priest stood up and asked Him, “Have you no answer? What are these men testifying against you?”"
Matthew,26,63,"But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to Him, “I charge You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.” 64“You have said it yourself,” Jesus answered. “But I say to all of you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”g"
Matthew,26,65,"At this, the high priest tore his garments and said, “He has blasphemed! Why do we"
Matthew,26,66,"What do you think?” “He deserves to die,” they answered."
Matthew,26,67,"Then they spat in His face and struck Him. Others slapped Him, 68and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit You?” Peter Denies Jesus (Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:54-62; John 18:15-18)"
Matthew,26,69,"Meanwhile, Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him. “You were also with Jesus the Galilean,” she said."
Matthew,26,70,But he denied it before them all: “I do not know what you are talking about.”
Matthew,26,71,"When Peter had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”"
Matthew,26,72,And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man!”
Matthew,26,73,"After a little while, those standing nearby came up to Peter. “Surely you are one of them,” they said, “for your accent gives you away.”"
Matthew,26,74,"At that, he began to curse and swear to them, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed."

Matthew,27,3,"When Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was filled with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders. 4“I have sinned by betraying innocent blood,” he said. “What is that to us?” they replied, “You bear the responsibility.”"
Matthew,27,5,So Judas threw the silver into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.

Matthew,27,11,"Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, who questioned Him: “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus answered."
Matthew,27,12,"And when He was accused by the chief priests and elders, He gave no answer."
Matthew,27,13,"Then Pilate asked Him, “Do You not hear how many charges they are bringing against You?”"
Matthew,27,14,"But Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge, much to the governor’s amazement. The Crowd Chooses Barabbas (Mark 15:6-11; Luke 23:13-25)"

Matthew,27,17,"So when the crowd had assembled, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release"
Matthew,27,18,For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over.
Matthew,27,19,"While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message: “Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered terribly in a dream today because of Him.”"
Matthew,27,20,"But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death. 21“Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor. “Barabbas,” they replied. 22“What then should I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” Pilate asked. They all answered, “Crucify Him!” 23“Why?” asked Pilate. “What has He done wrong?” But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify Him!” Pilate Washes his Hands (Mark 15:12-15)"
Matthew,27,24,"When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but that instead a riot was breaking out, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “You shall bear the responsibility.”c"
Matthew,27,25,"All the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!”"
Matthew,27,26,So Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged and handed Him over to be crucified. The Soldiers Mock Jesus (Isaiah 50:4-11; Mark 15:16-20; Luke 22:63-65; John 19:1-15)

Matthew,28,9,"Suddenlyb Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him. 10“Do not be afraid,” said Jesus. “Go, tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.” The Report of the Guards"

Luke,8,14,"The seeds that fell among the thorns are those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the worries, riches, and pleasures of this life, and their fruit does not mature."

Luke,8,44,"She came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. 45“Who touched Me?” Jesus asked. But they all denied it. “Master,” said Peter,e “the people are crowding and pressing against You.”"
Luke,8,46,"But Jesus declared, “Someone touched Me, for I know that power has gone out from Me.”"
Luke,8,47,"Then the woman, seeing that she could not escape notice, came trembling and fell down before Him. In the presence of all the people she explained why she had touched Him and how she had immediately been healed. 48“Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”"
Luke,8,49,"While He was still speaking, someone arrived from the house of the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he told Jairus. “Do not trouble the Teacher anymore.”"

Luke,22,14,"When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at the table with His apostles."
Luke,22,15,And He said

Luke,22,21,Look! The hand of My betrayer is with Mine on the table.
Luke,22,22,"Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.”"
Luke,22,23,Then they began to question among themselves which of them was going to do this. Who is the Greatest?

Luke,22,27,"For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is not the one who reclines? But I am among you as the One who serves."
Luke,22,28,You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials.

Luke,22,31,"Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat."
Luke,22,32,"But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” 33“Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death.”"
Luke,22,34,"But Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.”"
Luke,22,35,"Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” “Nothing,” they answered. 36“Now, however,” He told them, “the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag;"

Luke,22,41,"And He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed, 42“Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.”"
Luke,22,43,Then an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him.
Luke,22,44,"And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.c"

Luke,22,48,"But Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”"

Luke,22,54,"Then they seized Jesus, led Him away, and took Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed at a distance."
Luke,22,55,When those present had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down
Luke,22,56,"A servant girl saw him seated in the firelight and looked intently at him. “This man was also with Him,” she said."

Luke,22,66,"At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and scribes, met together. They led Jesus into their council and said, 67“If You are the Christ, tell us.”"

Luke,22,69,But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”
Luke,22,70,"So they all asked, “Are You then the Son of God?” He replied, “You say that I am.” 71“Why do we need any more testimony?” they declared. “We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips.” a 19-20 Some manuscripts end verse 19 after This is My body and do not include verse 20 b 37 Isaiah 53:12 c 43-44 Some manuscripts do not include verses 43 and 44 d 64 BYZ and TR include they were striking him on the face"
Luke,23,1,Then the whole council rose and led Jesus away to Pilate.

Luke,23,3,"So Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied."
Luke,23,4,"Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”"
Luke,23,5,"But they kept insisting, “He stirs up the people all over Judea with His teaching. He began in Galilee and has come all the way here.” Jesus Before Herod"
Luke,23,6,"When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean."
Luke,23,7,"And learning that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself was in Jerusalem at that time."
Luke,23,8,"When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased. He had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had heard about Him and was hoping to see Him perform a miracle."
Luke,23,9,"Herod questioned Jesus at great length, but He gave no answer."
Luke,23,10,"Meanwhile, the chief priests and scribes stood there, vehemently accusing Him."
Luke,23,11,"And even Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked Him. Dressing Him in a fine robe, they sent Him back to Pilate."

Luke,23,22,"A third time he said to them, “What evil has this man done? I have found in Him no offense worthy of death. So after I punish Him, I will release Him.”"

John,4,1,When Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard He was gaining and baptizing more
John,4,3,He left Judea and returned to Galilee.
John,4,4,Now He had to pass through Samaria.
John,4,5,"So He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar,"
John,4,6,"Since Jacob’s well was there, Jesus, weary from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour."
John,4,7,"When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” 8(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) 9“You are a Jew,” said the woman. “How can You ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)"
John,4,10,"Jesus answered, “If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.” 11“Sir,” the woman replied, “You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where"
John,4,12,"Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?”"
John,4,13,"Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again."
John,4,14,"But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a fount of water springing up to eternal life.”"
John,4,15,"The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”"
John,4,16,"Jesus told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.” 17“I have no husband,” the woman replied."
John,4,18,"In fact, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. You have spoken truthfully.”"
John,4,20,"Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where one must worship is in Jerusalem.” 21“Believe Me, woman,” Jesus replied, “a time is coming when you will worship the Father"

John,4,25,"The woman said, “I know that Messiah (called Christ) is coming. When He comes, He will explain everything to us.”"
John,4,26,"Jesus answered, “I who speak to you am He.” The Disciples Return and Marvel"
John,4,27,"Just then, His disciples returned and were astonished that He was speaking with a woman. But no one asked Him, “What do You want from her?” or “Why are You talking with her?”"
John,4,28,"Then the woman left her water jar, went back into the town, and said to the people,"
John,4,30,So they left the town and made their way toward Jesus.
John,4,31,"Meanwhile, the disciples urged Him, “Rabbi, eat something.”"
John,4,32,"But He told them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”"
John,4,33,"So the disciples asked one another, “Could someone have brought Him food?”"
John,4,34,"Jesus explained, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work."
John,4,35,"Do you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest?’ I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are ripe for harvest."

John,4,40,"So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to stay with them, and He stayed two days."

John,4,45,"Yet when He arrived, the Galileans welcomed Him. They had seen all the great things He had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they had gone there as well."
John,4,46,"So once again He came to Cana in Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine."
John,4,47,"When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged Him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die."
John,4,48,"Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.” 49“Sir,” The official said, “come down before my child dies.” 50“Go,” said Jesus, “your son will live.”"
John,4,51,"While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was alive."
John,4,52,"So he inquired as to the hour when his son had recovered, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.”"
John,4,53,"Then the father realized that this was the very hour in which Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” And he and all his household believed."
John,4,54,This was now the second sign that Jesus performed after coming from Judea into Galilee.
John,5,1,"Later on there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
John,5,2,"Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool with five covered colonnades,"
John,5,3,"On these walkways lay a great number of the sick, the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed.a"
John,5,5,One man there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
John,5,6,"Jesus saw him lying there and realized he had already been there a long time. “Do you want to get well?” He asked. 7“Sir,” replied the sick man, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am on my way, someone else goes in before me.”"
John,5,8,"Then Jesus told him, “Get up, pick up your mat, and walk.”"
John,5,9,"Immediately the man was made well, and he picked up his mat and began to walk. Now this happened on the Sabbath day, 10so the Jews said to the man who was healed, “This is the Sabbath! It is unlawful for you to carry your mat.”"
John,5,11,"But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’” 12“Who is this man who told you to pick it up and walk?” they asked."
John,5,13,"But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while the crowd was there."
John,5,14,"Afterward, Jesus found the man in the temple and said to him, “See, you have been"
John,5,15,And the man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. The Father and the Son
John,5,16,"Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews began to persecute"
John,5,17,"But Jesus answered them, “To this very day My Father is at His work, and I too am working.”"
John,5,18,"Because of this, the Jews tried all the harder to kill Him. Not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God."
John,5,19,"So Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by Himself, unless He"

John,5,21,"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wishes."
John,5,22,"Furthermore, the Father judges no one, but has assigned all judgment to the Son, 23so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him."
John,5,24,"Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and will not come under judgment. Indeed, he has crossed over from death to life."

John,6,3,Then Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down with His disciples.
John,6,4,Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was near.
John,6,5,"When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward Him, He said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread for these people"
John,6,6,"But He was asking this to test him, for He knew what He was about to do."
John,6,7,"Philip answered, “Two hundred denariia would not buy enough bread for each of them to have a small piece.”"
John,6,8,"One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him, 9“Here is a boy with five barley loaves and two small fish. But what difference will these make among so many?” 10“Have the people sit down,” Jesus said. There was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down, about five thousand of them."
John,6,11,"Then Jesus took the loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted."
John,6,12,"And when everyone was full, He said to His disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left"
John,6,13,So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.

John,8,10,"Then Jesus straightened upb and asked her, “Woman, where are your accusers?c Has no one condemned you?” 11“No one, Lord.” she answered. “Neither do I condemn you.” Jesus declared. “Now go and sin no more.” Jesus the Light of the World (1 John 1:5-10)"
John,8,12,"Once again, Jesus spoke to the people and said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”"
John,8,13,"So the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.”"
John,8,14,"Jesus replied, “Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from or where I am going."
John,8,15,You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
John,8,16,"But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone when I judge; I am with the Father, who sent Me."
John,8,17,Even in your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.
John,8,18,"I am One who testifies about Myself, and the Father who sent Me also testifies about Me.” 19“Where is Your Father?” they asked Him. “You do not know Me or My Father,” Jesus answered. “If you knew Me, you would know My Father as well.”"
John,8,20,"He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts, near the treasury. Yet no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come."
John,8,21,"Again He said to them, “I am going away, and you will look for Me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”"
John,8,22,"So the Jews began to ask, “Will He kill Himself, since He says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”"
John,8,23,"Then He told them, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am"
John,8,24,"That is why I told you that you would die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.” 25“Who are You?” they asked. “Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,” Jesus replied. 26“I have much to say about you and much to judge. But the One who sent Me is truthful, and what I have heard from Him, I tell the world.”"
John,8,27,They did not understand that He was telling them about the Father.
John,8,28,"So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do"
John,8,29,"He who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do what pleases Him.” The Truth will Set You Free (2 John 1:4-6)"

John,8,31,So He said to the Jews who had

John,8,34,"Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin."
John,8,35,A slave is

John,8,38,"I speak of what I have seen in the presence of the Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.” 39“Abraham is our father,” they replied."
John,8,40,"But now you are trying to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God."
John,8,41,"You are doing the works of your father.” “We are not illegitimate children,” they answered. “Our only Father is God Himself.”"
John,8,42,"Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on My own, but He sent Me."
John,8,43,Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you are unable to accept
John,8,44,"You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out his desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, refusing to uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, because he is a liar and the"

John,8,51,"Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.” 52“Now we know that You have a demon!” declared the Jews. “Abraham died, and so did"

John,9,8,"At this, his neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging began to ask, “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?”"
John,9,9,"Some claimed that he was, but others said, “No, he just looks like him.” But the man kept saying, “I am the one.” 10“How then were your eyes opened?” they asked."
John,9,11,"He answered, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and anointed my eyes, and He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and received my sight.” 12“Where is He?” they asked. “I do not know,” he answered. The Pharisees Investigate the Healing"
John,9,13,They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.
John,9,14,Now the day on which
John,9,15,"So the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. The man answered, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.”"
John,9,16,"Because of this, some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for He does not keep the Sabbath.” But others said, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?”"
John,9,17,"So once again they asked the man who had been blind, “What do you have to say about Him, since it was your eyes He opened?” “He is a prophet.” the man replied."
John,9,18,"The Jews still did not believe that the man had been blind and had received his sight until they summoned his parents 19and asked, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? So how is it that he can now see?”"
John,9,20,"His parents answered, “We know he is our son, and we know he was born blind."
John,9,21,"But how he can now see or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.”"
John,9,22,His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already determined that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Christ would be put out of the
John,9,23,"That was why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.”"
John,9,24,"So a second time they called for the man who had been blind and said, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.”"
John,9,25,"He answered, “Whether He is a sinner I do not know. There is one thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see!” 26“What did He do to you?” they asked. “How did He open your eyes?”"
John,9,27,"He replied, “I already told you and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?”"
John,9,28,"Then they heaped insults on him and said, “You are His disciple; we are disciples of"

John,9,35,"When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, He found the man and said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”a 36“Who is He, Sir?” he replied. “Tell me so that I may believe in Him.” 37“You have already seen Him,” Jesus answered. “He is the One speaking with you.” 38“Lord, I believe,” he said. And he worshiped Jesus."
John,9,39,"Then Jesus declared, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind may see and those who see may become blind.”b"
John,9,40,"Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard this, and they asked Him, “Are we blind too?” 41“If you were blind,” Jesus replied, “you would not be guilty of sin.

John,10,18,"No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from My Father.”"
John,10,19,Again there was division among the Jews because of Jesus’ message.
John,10,20,"Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and insane. Why would you listen to Him?”"

John,10,32,"But Jesus answered, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone Me?” 33“We are not stoning You for any good work,” said the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because You, who are a man, declare Yourself to be God.”"
John,10,34,"Jesus replied, “Is it not written in your Law: ‘I have said you are gods’b?"
John,10,35,If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and the Scripture cannot be broken— 36then what about the One whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world? How then can you accuse Me of blasphemy for stating that I am the Son of God?
John,10,37,"If I am not doing the works of My Father, then do not believe Me."
John,10,38,"But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works themselves, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father.”"
John,10,39,"At this, they tried again to seize Him, but He escaped their grasp. John's Testimony Confirmed"
John,10,40,Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had first been

John,11,3,"So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one You love is sick.”"
John,11,4,"When Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”"
John,11,5,Now Jesus Loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
John,11,6,Yet when He heard that Lazarus
John,11,7,"Finally, He said to the disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.” 8“Rabbi,” they replied, “the Jews just tried to stone You, and You are going back there?”"
John,11,9,"Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? If anyone walks in the daytime,"
John,11,10,"But if anyone walks at night, he will stumble, because he has no light.”"
John,11,11,"After He had said this, He told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up.”"
John,11,12,"His disciples said, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get better.”"
John,11,13,"They thought that Jesus was talking about actual sleep, but He was speaking about the death of Lazarus."
John,11,14,"So Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead, 15and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”"

John,11,22,"But even now I know that God will give You whatever You ask Him.” 23“Your brother will rise again,” Jesus told her."
John,11,24,"Martha replied, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”"
John,11,25,"Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me will live,"
John,11,26,"And everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?” 27“Yes, Lord,” she answered, “I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”"
John,11,28,"After Martha had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside to tell her,"
John,11,29,"When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him."
John,11,30,"Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had"
John,11,31,"When the Jews who were in the house consoling Mary saw how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn"
John,11,32,"When Mary came to Jesus and saw Him, she fell at His feet and said, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.”"
John,11,33,"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spiritb and troubled. 34“Where have you laid him,” He asked. “Come and see, Lord,” they answered."
John,11,35,Jesus wept.
John,11,36,"Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!”"
John,11,37,"But some of them asked, “Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind also have prevented Lazarus from dying?” Jesus Raises Lazarus (Acts 20:7-12)"
John,11,38,"Jesus, once again deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. 39“Take away the stone,” Jesus said. “Lord, by now he stinks,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man. “It has already been four days.”"
John,11,40,"Jesus replied, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God.”"
John,11,41,"So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank You that"
John,11,42,"I knew that You always hear Me, but I say this for the benefit of the people standing here, so they may believe that You sent Me.”"
John,11,43,"After Jesus had said this, He called out in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out.”"
John,11,44,"The man who had been dead came out with his hands and feet bound in strips of linen, and his face wrapped in a headcloth. “Unwrap him and let him go,” Jesus told them. The Plot to Kill Jesus (Matthew 26:1-5; Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-6)"
John,11,45,"Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen what Jesus did,"
John,11,46,But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
John,11,47,"Then the chief priests and Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin and said, “What are we"
John,11,48,"If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”"
John,11,49,"But one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You"
John,11,50,You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.”
John,11,51,"Caiaphas did not say this on his own. Instead, as high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation, 52and not only for the nation, but also for the scattered children of God, to gather them together into one."
John,11,53,So from that day on they plotted to kill Him.
John,11,54,"As a result, Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but He withdrew to a town called Ephraim in an area near the wilderness. And He stayed there with the disciples."
John,11,55,"Now the Jewish Passover was near, and many people went up from the country to"
John,11,56,"They kept looking for Jesus and asking one another as they stood in the temple courts, “What do you think? Will He come"

John,12,2,"So they hosted a dinner for Jesus there. Martha served,"
John,12,3,"Then Mary took about a pinta of expensive perfume, made of pure nard, and anointed Jesus’ feet and wiped them with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume."
John,12,4,"But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was going to betray Him, asked, 5“Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denariib and the money given to the poor?”"
John,12,6,"Judas did not say this because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money bag, he used to take from what was put into it. 7“Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “She was intended to keep this perfume to prepare for"

John,12,16,"At first His disciples did not understand these things, but after Jesus was glorified they remembered what had been done to Him, and they realized that these very things had also been written about Him."
John,12,17,"Meanwhile, many people continued to testify that they were with Jesus when He called"
John,12,18,"That is also why the crowd went out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign."

And as she wept, she bent down to look into the tomb, 12and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at the feet. 13“Woman, why are you weeping,” they asked. “Because they have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I do not know where they have put Him.”"
John,20,14,"When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there; but she did not recognize that it was Jesus. 15“Woman, why are you weeping?” Jesus asked her. “Who are you looking for?” Thinking He was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried Him off, tell me where you have put Him, and I will get Him.”"
John,20,16,"Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to Him in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means, Teacher). 17“Do not cling to Me,” Jesus said, “For I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go and tell My brothers, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God.’”"

John,21,5,"So He said to them, “Children, do you have any fish?” “No,” they answered."
John,21,6,"He told them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast it there, and they were unable to haul it in because of the great number of fish."

John,21,17,"Jesus asked a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love Me?” Peter was deeply hurt that Jesus had asked him a third time, “Do you love Me?” “Lord, You know all things;” he replied, “You know I love You.” Jesus said to him, “Feed My sheep."

John,21,22,"Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you? You follow"
John,21,23,"Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say that he would not die, but only, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you?”"

Acts,22,23,"As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air, 24the commander ordered that Paul be brought into the barracks. He directed that Paul be flogged and interrogated to determine the reason for this outcry against him."
Acts,22,25,"But as they stretched him out to strap him down, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it lawful for you to flog a Roman Citizen without a trial?”"
Acts,22,26,"On hearing this, the centurion went and reported it to the commander. “What are you going to do?” he said. “This man is a Roman citizen.”"
Acts,22,27,"The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman Citizen?” “Yes,” he answered. 28“I paid a high price for my citizenship,” said the commander. “But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied."

Acts,23,4,"But those standing nearby said, “How dare you insult the high priest of God!” 5“Brothers,” Paul replied, “I was not aware that he was the high priest, for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.’a”"
Acts,23,6,"Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. It is because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.”"
Acts,23,7,"As soon as he had said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and Sadducees,"
Acts,23,8,"For the Sadducees say there is neither a resurrection, nor angels, nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all."
Acts,23,9,"A great clamor arose, and some scribes from the party of the Pharisees got up and contended sharply, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has"
Acts,23,10,The dispute grew so violent that the commander was afraid they would tear Paul to pieces. He ordered the soldiers to go down and remove him by force and bring him into the barracks.

Romans,1,18,The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and

Romans,1,20,"For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood from His workmanship, so that men are without excuse."
Romans,1,21,"For although they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him,"
Romans,1,22,"Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools, 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images of mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles."

Romans,3,19,"Now we know that whatever the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God."
Romans,3,20,Therefore no one will be justified in His sight by works of the Law. For the Law merely brings awareness of sin. Righteousness through Faith

Romans,3,22,"And this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no distinction, 23for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24and are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."

Romans,3,26,"He did this to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and to justify the one who has faith in Jesus."
Romans,3,27,"Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of works? No, but"

Romans,4,17,"As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.”c He is our father in the presence of God, in whom he believed, the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being what does not yet exist."

1 Corinthians,7,35,"I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but in order to promote proper decorum and undivided devotion to the Lord."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"However, if someone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his betrothed, and if she is beyond her youth and they ought to marry, let him do as he wishes; he is not sinning;"
1 Corinthians,7,37,"But the man who is firmly established in his heart and under no constraint, with control over his will and resolve in his heart not to marry the virgin, he will do well."
1 Corinthians,7,38,"So then, he who marries the virgin does well, but he who does not marry her does even better."
1 Corinthians,7,39,"A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free"

1 Corinthians,8,1,Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge
1 Corinthians,8,2,The one who thinks he knows something does not yet know
1 Corinthians,8,3,But the one who loves God is known by God.
1 Corinthians,8,4,So about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the
1 Corinthians,8,5,"For even if there are so called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many so-called gods and lords), 6yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we exist. And there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we exist."
1 Corinthians,8,7,"But not everyone has this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that they eat such food as if it were sacrificed to an idol. And since their conscience is weak, it"
1 Corinthians,8,8,"But food does not bring us closer to God: We are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do."
1 Corinthians,8,9,"Be careful, however, that your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak."
1 Corinthians,8,10,For if someone with a weak conscience sees you who are well informed eating in an

1 Corinthians,8,13,"Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to stumble."
1 Corinthians,9,1,Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you yourselves
1 Corinthians,9,2,"Even if I am not an apostle to others, surely I am to you. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,9,3,This is my defense to those who scrutinize me:
1 Corinthians,9,4,Have we no right to food and to drink?
1 Corinthians,9,5,"Have we no right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the Lord’s"
1 Corinthians,9,6,Or are Barnabas and I the only apostles who must work for a living?
1 Corinthians,9,7,Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not drink of its milk?
1 Corinthians,9,8,Do I say this from a human perspective? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing?
1 Corinthians,9,9,For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.”b Is

1 Corinthians,9,11,"If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much for us to reap a material"
1 Corinthians,9,12,"If others partake of this right from you, shouldn’t we share in it all the more? But we did not make use of this right. Instead, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ."
1 Corinthians,9,13,"Do you not know that those who work in the temple eat of its food, and those who"
1 Corinthians,9,14,"In the same way, the Lord has prescribed that"
1 Corinthians,9,15,"But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this to suggest that something be done for me. Indeed, I would rather die than for anyone to nullify my boast."

1 Corinthians,9,24,"Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? Run"
1 Corinthians,9,25,"Everyone who competes in the games trains with strict discipline. They do it for a crown that is perishable, but we do it for a crown that is"
1 Corinthians,9,26,Therefore I do not run aimlessly; I do not fight like I am beating the air.

1 Corinthians,10,2,They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud
1 Corinthians,10,3,"They all ate the same spiritual food 4and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ."
1 Corinthians,10,5,"Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the wilderness."
1 Corinthians,10,6,These things took place as examples to keep us from craving evil things as they did.
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Do not be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written: “The people sat down to eat and"
1 Corinthians,10,8,"We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died."
1 Corinthians,10,9,"We should not test Christ,b as some of them did, and were killed by snakes."
1 Corinthians,10,10,"And do not complain, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroying angel."

1 Corinthians,10,13,"No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide an escape, so that you can stand up under it. Flee from Idolatry (Exodus 20:22-23; Leviticus 19:1-8)"
1 Corinthians,10,14,"Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak to reasonable people; judge for
1 Corinthians,10,16,Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?

1 Corinthians,11,12,"For just as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God."
1 Corinthians,11,13,Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
1 Corinthians,11,14,"Doesn’t nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a disgrace to him, 15but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering."

1 Corinthians,12,11,"All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, who apportions them to each one as He determines. The Body of Christ"
1 Corinthians,12,12,"The body is a unit, though it is comprised of many parts. And although its parts are"
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free, and we were all given one Spirit to drink."
1 Corinthians,12,14,"For the body does not consist of one part, but of many."
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less"

1 Corinthians,12,19,"If they were all one part, where would the body be?"
1 Corinthians,12,20,"As it is, there are many parts, but one body."

And our unpresentable parts are treated with special modesty, 24whereas our presentable parts have no such need.

1 Corinthians,12,28,"And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, and those with gifts of healing, helping, administration, and various tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,29,Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
1 Corinthians,12,30,Do all have
1 Corinthians,12,31,But eagerly desire the greater gifts. And now I will show you a way that is beyond comparison.

1 Corinthians,13,12,"Now we see but a dim reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known."

1 Corinthians,14,1,"Earnestly pursue love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God. Indeed, no one"
1 Corinthians,14,3,But he who prophesies speaks to men
1 Corinthians,14,4,"The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church."
1 Corinthians,14,5,"I wish that all of you could speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"Now brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you, unless I bring"

1 Corinthians,14,8,"Again, if the trumpet sounds a muffled call, who will prepare"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air."
1 Corinthians,14,10,"Assuredly, there are many different languages in the world, yet none of them is without"
1 Corinthians,14,11,"If, then, I do not know the meaning of someone’s language, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me."
1 Corinthians,14,12,"It is the same with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, strive to excel in"
1 Corinthians,14,13,"Therefore, the one who speaks in a tongue should pray"
1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful."
1 Corinthians,14,15,"What then shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will"
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Otherwise, if you speak a blessing in spirit, how can someone who is uninstructed say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other one is not edified."
1 Corinthians,14,18,I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
1 Corinthians,14,19,"But in the church, I would rather speak five coherent words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be"
1 Corinthians,14,21,"It is written in the Law: “By strange tongues and foreign lips I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to Me, says the Lord.”a"
1 Corinthians,14,22,"Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers."
1 Corinthians,14,23,"So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who are uninstructed or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your"

So he will fall facedown and worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among you!” Orderly Worship"
1 Corinthians,14,26,"What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a psalm or a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. All of these must be done to build up the church."
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If anyone speaks in a tongue, two, or at most three, should speak in turn, and someone"
1 Corinthians,14,28,"But if there is no interpreter, he should remain silent in the church and speak only to himself and God."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said."
1 Corinthians,14,30,"And if a revelation comes to someone who is seated, the first speaker should hold his"
1 Corinthians,14,31,For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and

1 Corinthians,14,35,"If they wish to inquire about something, they are to ask their own husbands at home; for it is dishonorable for a woman to speak in the church."
1 Corinthians,14,36,Did God’s word originate with you? Or are you the only ones it has reached?
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person, let him acknowledge that what I am writing"

1 Corinthians,14,39,"So, my brothers, be eager to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues."

1 Corinthians,15,1,"Now brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received,"
1 Corinthians,15,2,"By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5and that He appeared to Cephasa and then to the Twelve."

1 Corinthians,15,15,"In that case, we are also exposed as false witnesses about God. For we have testified about God that He raised Christ from the dead, but He did not raise Him if in fact the dead are not raised."
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead are not raised, then not even has Christ been raised."
1 Corinthians,15,17,And if Christ has

1 Corinthians,15,20,"But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen"
1 Corinthians,15,21,"For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also"
1 Corinthians,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."
1 Corinthians,15,23,"But each in his own turn: Christ the firstfruits; then at His coming, those who belong to Him."
1 Corinthians,15,24,"Then the end will come, when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father after He"

1 Corinthians,15,27,For “God has put everything under His feet.”b Now when it says that everything has been put under
1 Corinthians,15,28,"And when all things have been subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will be made subject to Him who put all things under Him, so that God may be all in all."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"If these things are not so, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead"

1 Corinthians,15,33,Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good character.”d
1 Corinthians,15,34,"Sober up as you ought, and stop sinning; for some of you are ignorant of God. I say this to your shame. The Resurrection Body"
1 Corinthians,15,35,"But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they"
1 Corinthians,15,36,You fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
1 Corinthians,15,37,"And what you sow is not the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or something else."
1 Corinthians,15,38,"But God gives it a body as He has designed, and to each kind of seed He gives its own body."
1 Corinthians,15,39,"Not all flesh is the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds"

1 Corinthians,15,41,"The sun has one degree of splendor, the moon another, and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor."
1 Corinthians,15,42,So will it be with the resurrection of the dead: What is sown is perishable; it is raised
1 Corinthians,15,43,It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is

1 Corinthians,15,54,"When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come to pass: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”f 55“Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?”g"
1 Corinthians,15,56,"The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law."
1 Corinthians,15,57,"But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!"
1 Corinthians,15,58,"Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast and immovable. Always excel in the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain. a 5 That is, Peter b 27 Psalm 8:6 c 32 Isaiah 22:13 d 33 Probably a quote from the Greek comedy 'Thais' by Menander e 45 Genesis 2:7 f 54 Isaiah 25:8 g 55 Hosea 13:14"

2 Corinthians,1,10,"He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and He will deliver us. In Him we have placed our hope that He will yet again deliver us, 11as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the favor shown us in answer to their prayers. Paul's Change of Plans"
2 Corinthians,1,12,"And this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in relation to you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God—"
2 Corinthians,1,13,"For we do not write you anything that is beyond your ability to read and understand. And I hope that you will understand completely, 14as you have already understood us in part, so that you may boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of our Lord Jesus."
2 Corinthians,1,15,"Confident of this, I planned to visit you first, so that you might receive a double blessing."
2 Corinthians,1,16,"I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to return to you from Macedonia, and then to have you help me on my way to Judea."
2 Corinthians,1,17,"When I planned this, did I do it carelessly? Or do I make my plans by human standards,"
2 Corinthians,1,18,"But as surely as God is faithful,"
2 Corinthians,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed among you by me and Silvanusa and Timothy, was not “Yes” and “No,” but in"
2 Corinthians,1,20,"For all the promises of God are “Yes” in Christ. And so through Him, our “Amen” is spoken to the glory of God."

2 Corinthians,2,1,So I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you.
2 Corinthians,2,2,"For if I grieve you, who"
2 Corinthians,2,3,I wrote as I did so that on my arrival I would not be saddened by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all
2 Corinthians,2,4,"For through many tears I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart, not to grieve you but to let you know how much I love you."
2 Corinthians,2,5,"Now if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but all of you—to some degree,"
2 Corinthians,2,6,The punishment imposed on him by the majority is sufficient for him.
2 Corinthians,2,7,"So instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed"
2 Corinthians,2,8,Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.
2 Corinthians,2,9,My purpose in writing you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in
2 Corinthians,2,10,"If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And if I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven it in the presence of Christ for your sake, 11in order that Satan should not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes. Triumph in Christ"
2 Corinthians,2,12,Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and a door stood open for me
2 Corinthians,2,13,"I had no peace in my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia."
2 Corinthians,2,14,"But thanks be to God, who always leads us triumphantly in Christ and through us"
2 Corinthians,2,15,For we are to God the sweet aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.
2 Corinthians,2,16,"To the one, we are an odor of death and demise; to the other, a fragrance that brings life. And who is qualified for such a task?"
2 Corinthians,2,17,"For we are not like so many others, who peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as men sent from God."
2 Corinthians,3,1,"Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters"
2 Corinthians,3,2,"You yourselves are our letter, inscribed on our"
2 Corinthians,3,3,"It is clear that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts."
2 Corinthians,3,4,Such confidence before God is ours through Christ.
2 Corinthians,3,5,"Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim that anything comes from us, but our competence comes from God."
2 Corinthians,3,6,"And He has qualified us as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. The Glory of the New Covenant (Exodus 34:29-35)"
2 Corinthians,3,7,"Now if the ministry of death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at the face of Moses because of its fleeting glory,"
2 Corinthians,3,9,"For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry of righteousness!"
2 Corinthians,3,10,"Indeed, what was once glorious has no glory now in comparison to the glory that"
2 Corinthians,3,11,"For if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which endures!"
2 Corinthians,3,12,"Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold."
2 Corinthians,3,13,"We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at the end of what was fading away."
2 Corinthians,3,14,"But their minds were closed. For to this day, the same veil remains at the reading of the"
2 Corinthians,3,15,And even
2 Corinthians,3,16,"But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away."
2 Corinthians,3,17,"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."
2 Corinthians,3,18,"And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into His image with intensifying glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit."
2 Corinthians,4,1,"Therefore, since we have this ministry through the mercy of God, we do not lose heart."
2 Corinthians,4,2,"Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful ways. We do not practice deceit, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by open proclamation of the truth, we"
2 Corinthians,4,3,"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing."
2 Corinthians,4,4,The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers so they cannot see the light of
2 Corinthians,4,5,For we do not proclaim
2 Corinthians,4,6,"For God, who said “Let light shine out of darkness,”a made His light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.b Treasures in Jars of Clay (Romans 6:1-14)"
2 Corinthians,4,7,Now we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this surpassingly great power is
2 Corinthians,4,8,"We are pressed on all sides, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; 9persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed."
2 Corinthians,4,10,"We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may"
2 Corinthians,4,11,For we who are alive are always consigned to death for
2 Corinthians,4,12,"So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"And in keeping with what is written: “I believed, therefore I have spoken,”c we who have the same spirit of faith also believe and therefore speak, 14knowing that the One who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in His"
2 Corinthians,4,15,"All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is extending to more and more people may overflow in thanksgiving, to the glory of God."
2 Corinthians,4,16,"Therefore we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, yet our inner"
2 Corinthians,4,17,For our light and temporary affliction is producing for
2 Corinthians,4,18,"So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. a 6 Genesis 1:3 b 6 SBL, NE, and WH in the face of Christ c 13 Psalm 116:10"
2 Corinthians,5,1,"Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is dismantled, we have a building from"
2 Corinthians,5,2,"For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, 3because when we are clothed, we will"
2 Corinthians,5,4,"So while we are in this tent, we groan under our burdens, because we do not wish to be unclothed but clothed, so that our mortality may be swallowed up"
2 Corinthians,5,5,And God has prepared us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a pledge of what is to come.
2 Corinthians,5,6,"Therefore we are always confident, although we know that while we are at home in the"
2 Corinthians,5,7,"For we walk by faith, not by sight."
2 Corinthians,5,8,"We are confident,"
2 Corinthians,5,9,So we

2 Corinthians,5,11,"Therefore, since we know what it means to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What"
2 Corinthians,5,12,"We are not commending ourselves to you again. Instead, we are giving you an occasion to be proud of us, so that you can answer those who take pride in appearances rather than in the heart."
2 Corinthians,5,13,"If we are out of our mind, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you."
2 Corinthians,5,14,"For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that One died for all, therefore all"
2 Corinthians,5,15,"And He died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died for them and was raised again."
2 Corinthians,5,16,So from now on we regard no one according to the flesh. Although we once regarded
2 Corinthians,5,17,"Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.a The old has passed away. Behold, the new has come!"
2 Corinthians,5,18,"All this is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: 19that God was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ, not counting men’s trespasses against them. And He has committed to us the message of reconciliation."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His appeal"
2 Corinthians,5,21,"God made Him who knew no sin to be sinb on our behalf, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God. a 17 Or creature b 21 Or be a sin offering"
2 Corinthians,6,1,"As God’s fellow workers, we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain."
2 Corinthians,6,2,"For He says: “In the time of favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.”a Behold, now is the time of favor; now is the day of salvation!"
2 Corinthians,6,3,"We put no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no one can discredit our ministry."
2 Corinthians,6,4,"Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships, and calamities; 5in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in labor, sleepless nights, and hunger; 6in purity, knowledge, patience, and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; 7in truthful speech and in the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left; 8through glory and dishonor, slander and praise; viewed as imposters, yet genuine; 9as unknown, yet well-known; dying, and yet we live on; punished, yet not killed; 10sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything."
2 Corinthians,6,11,"We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians. Our hearts are open wide."
2 Corinthians,6,12,It is not our
2 Corinthians,6,13,"As a fair exchange, I ask you as my children: Open wide your hearts also. Do Not Be Unequally Yoked (Exodus 29:45-46)"
2 Corinthians,6,14,Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership can righteousness

2 Corinthians,6,16,"What agreement can exist between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people.”b 17“Therefore come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.”c"

2 Corinthians,7,1,"Therefore, beloved, since we have these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that defiles body and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
2 Corinthians,7,2,"Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one,"
2 Corinthians,7,3,I do not say this to condemn you. I have said before that you
2 Corinthians,7,4,Great is my confidence in you; great is my pride in you; I am filled with encouragement; in all our troubles my joy overflows.
2 Corinthians,7,5,"For when we arrived in Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were pressed from"
2 Corinthians,7,6,"But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the arrival of Titus, 7and not only by his arrival, but also by the comfort he had received from you. He told us about your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced all the more."
2 Corinthians,7,8,"Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Although I did regret it, I"
2 Corinthians,7,9,"And now I rejoice, not because you were made sorrowful, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you felt the sorrow that God had intended, and so were not harmed in any way by us."
2 Corinthians,7,10,"Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation without regret, but worldly sorrow brings death."
2 Corinthians,7,11,"Consider what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal, what vindication! In every way you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter."
2 Corinthians,7,12,"So even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did wrong or the one who was harmed, but rather that your earnestness on our behalf would be made clear"
2 Corinthians,7,13,"On account of this, we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were even more delighted by the joy of Titus."
2 Corinthians,7,14,"Indeed, I was not embarrassed by anything I had boasted to him about you. But just as everything we said to you was true,"
2 Corinthians,7,15,And his affection for you is even greater when he remembers that you were all obedient as you welcomed him with fear
2 Corinthians,7,16,I rejoice that I can have complete confidence in you.
2 Corinthians,8,1,"Now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace God has given the churches of"
2 Corinthians,8,2,"In the terrible ordeal they suffered, their abundant joy and deep poverty"
2 Corinthians,8,3,"For I testify that they gave according to their ability and even beyond it. On their own accord, 4they pleaded earnestly for the privilege of sharing"
2 Corinthians,8,5,"And not only did they do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, because it was the will of God."
2 Corinthians,8,6,"So we urged Titus to help complete your act of grace, just as he had started it."
2 Corinthians,8,7,"But just as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness,"
2 Corinthians,8,8,"I am not making a demand, but I am testing the sincerity of your love in comparison to the earnestness of others. Christ's Example"

2 Corinthians,8,15,"As it is written: “He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no shortfall.”a Titus Commended (Titus 1:1-4)"
2 Corinthians,8,16,"But thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same devotion I have for you."
2 Corinthians,8,17,"For not only did he welcome our appeal, but he is eagerly coming to you of his own volition."
2 Corinthians,8,18,"Along with Titus, we are sending the brother who is praised by all the churches for his"
2 Corinthians,8,19,"More than that, this brother was chosen by the churches to accompany us with the offering—the gracious gift we administer to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help."
2 Corinthians,8,20,We hope to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this generous gift.
2 Corinthians,8,21,"For we are taking great care to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of men."
2 Corinthians,8,22,"And we are sending along with them our brother, whose earnestness has been proven many times and in many ways, and now even more so by his great confidence in you."
2 Corinthians,8,23,"As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you. As for our brothers, they"
2 Corinthians,8,24,"In full view of the churches, then, show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our boasting about you. a 15 Exodus 16:18"
2 Corinthians,9,1,"Now about the service to the saints, there is no need for me to write to you."
2 Corinthians,9,2,"For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting to the Macedonians that since last year you in Achaia were prepared to give. And your zeal has stirred most of them to do likewise."
2 Corinthians,9,3,But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should
2 Corinthians,9,4,"Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—to say nothing of you—would"
2 Corinthians,9,5,"So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you beforehand and make arrangements for the bountiful gift you had promised. This way, your gift will be prepared generously and not begrudgingly."
2 Corinthians,9,6,"Consider this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows"
2 Corinthians,9,7,Each one should give what he has decided in his

2 Corinthians,9,12,"For this ministry of service is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanksgiving to God."
2 Corinthians,9,13,"Because of the proof this ministry provides, the saints will glorify God for your obedient confession of the gospel of Christ, and for the generosity of your contribution to them and"
2 Corinthians,9,14,"And their prayers for you will express their affection for you, because"

2 Corinthians,10,2,"I beg you that when I come, I may not need to be as bold as I expect toward those who presume that we live according to the flesh."
2 Corinthians,10,3,"For though we live in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh."
2 Corinthians,10,4,"The weapons of our warfare are not the weapons of the world. Instead, they have divine power to"
2 Corinthians,10,5,"We tear down arguments, and every presumption set up against the knowledge of God; and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ."
2 Corinthians,10,6,"And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, as soon as your obedience is complete."
2 Corinthians,10,7,"You are looking at outward appearances. If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ,"
2 Corinthians,10,8,"For even if I boast somewhat excessively about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed."
2 Corinthians,10,9,I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you by my letters.
2 Corinthians,10,10,"For some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but his physical presence is unimpressive, and his"
2 Corinthians,10,11,"Such people should consider that what we are in our letters when absent, we will be in our actions when present."
2 Corinthians,10,12,"We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves,"
2 Corinthians,10,13,"We, however, will not boast beyond our limits, but only within the field of influence that God has assigned to us—a field that reaches even to you."
2 Corinthians,10,14,"We are not overstepping our bounds, as if we had not come to you. Indeed, we were the first to reach you with the gospel of Christ."
2 Corinthians,10,15,"Neither do we boast beyond our limits in the labors of others. But we hope that, as your faith increases, our area of influence among you will greatly increase as well, 16so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. Then we will not be boasting in the work already done in another man’s territory."

2 Corinthians,11,2,"I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. For I promised you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,3,"I am afraid, however, that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds"
2 Corinthians,11,4,"For if someone comes and proclaims a Jesus other than the One we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit than the One you received, or a different gospel than the one you accepted, you put up with it way too easily."
2 Corinthians,11,5,I consider myself in no way inferior to those “super-apostles.”
2 Corinthians,11,6,"Although I am not a polished speaker, I am certainly not lacking in knowledge. We have made this clear to you in every way possible."
2 Corinthians,11,7,"Was it a sin for me to humble myself in order to exalt you, because I preached the gospel"

Galatians,3,21,"Is the Law, then, opposed to the promises of God? Not at all! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come from the Law."

Instead, he has an unhealthy interest in controversies and semantics, out of which come envy, strife, abusive talk, evil suspicions, 5and constant friction between men of depraved mind who are devoid of the truth.

2 Timothy,2,14,"Remind the believers of these things, charging them before Goda to avoid quarreling over words; this is in no way profitable, and leads its listeners to ruin."

Hebrews,5,4,"No one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God, just as Aaron was."
Hebrews,5,5,"So also Christ did not take upon Himself the glory of becoming a high priest, but He was called by the One who said to Him: “You are My Son, today I have become Your Father.”a"
Hebrews,5,6,And in another passage God says: “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”b

Hebrews,6,4,"It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, 5who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age— 6and then have fallen away—to be restored again to repentance, because they themselves are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting Him to open shame."

Hebrews,6,12,"Then you will not be sluggish, but will imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised. God's Unchangeable Promise"
Hebrews,6,13,"When God made His promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater to swear by, He"
Hebrews,6,15,"And so Abraham, after waiting patiently, obtained the promise."
Hebrews,6,16,"Men swear by someone greater than themselves, and their oath serves as a confirmation"
Hebrews,6,17,So when God wanted to make the unchanging nature of His
Hebrews,6,18,"Thus by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be strongly encouraged."
Hebrews,6,19,"We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and steadfast. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, 20where Jesus our forerunner has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever in the order of Melchizedek. a 1 Or from pointless rituals b 2 Or cleansing rites c 14 Genesis 22:17"
Hebrews,7,1,"This Melchizedek was King of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2and Abraham apportioned to him a tenth of everything. First, his name means “king of righteousness.” Then also, “king"
Hebrews,7,3,"Without father or mother or genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God, he remains a priest for all time."

Hebrews,7,9,"And so to speak, Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the"
Hebrews,7,10,"For when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the loin of his ancestor. A Superior Priesthood"
Hebrews,7,11,"Now if perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood (upon which basis the people received the Law), why was there still a need for another priest to"
Hebrews,7,12,"For when the priesthood is changed, the Law must be changed as well."
Hebrews,7,13,"He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, from which no one has"
Hebrews,7,14,"For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, a tribe as to which Moses said nothing about priests."
Hebrews,7,15,"And this point is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears, 16one who has become a priest not by a law of succession, but by the power of an indestructible life."
Hebrews,7,17,For it is testified: “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”a
Hebrews,7,18,"So the former commandment is set aside because it was weak and useless 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God."
Hebrews,7,20,"And none of this happened without an oath. For others became priests without an oath, 21but Jesus became a priest with an oath by the One who said to Him: “The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind, ‘You are a priest forever.’”b"
Hebrews,7,22,"Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant."
Hebrews,7,23,"Now there have been many other priests, since death prevented them from continuing"
Hebrews,7,24,"But because Jesus lives forever, He has a permanent priesthood."
Hebrews,7,25,"Therefore He is able to save completelyc those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to intercede for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"Such a high priest truly befits us—One who is holy, innocent, undefiled, set apart from"
Hebrews,7,27,"Unlike the other high priests, He does not need to offer daily sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people; He"

Hebrews,8,1,"The point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, 2and who ministers in the sanctuary and true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man."

Hebrews,8,7,For if that first covenant had
Hebrews,8,8,"But when God found fault with the people, He said: “Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah."
Hebrews,8,9,"It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not abide by My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord."
Hebrews,8,10,"This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord. I will put My laws in their minds, and inscribe them on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they will be My people."
Hebrews,8,11,"No longer will each one teach his neighbor or his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest."
Hebrews,8,12,"For I will forgive their iniquities, and remember their sins no more.”b"
Hebrews,8,13,"In speaking of a new covenant, He has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear. a 5 Exodus 25:40 b 8-12 Jeremiah 31:31-34"
Hebrews,9,1,Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.
Hebrews,9,2,"A tabernacle was constructed. In its first room were the lampstand, the table, and the"
Hebrews,9,3,"Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, 4containing the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. Inside the ark were the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had"
Hebrews,9,5,"Above the ark were the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercy seat. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now."
Hebrews,9,6,"When everything had been prepared in this way, the priests entered regularly into the"
Hebrews,9,7,"But only the high priest entered the inner room, and then only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance."
Hebrews,9,8,By this arrangement the Holy Spirit was showing that the way into the Most Holy Place
Hebrews,9,9,"It is an illustration for the present time, because the gifts and sacrifices being offered were unable"
Hebrews,9,10,They consist only in food and drink and special washings—external regulations imposed until the time of reform. Redemption through His Blood
Hebrews,9,11,"But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that have come,a He entered the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made by hands (that is, not of this creation)."
Hebrews,9,12,"He did not enter by the blood of goats and calves, but He entered the Most Holy Place once for all by His own blood, thus securing eternal redemption."
Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that their bodies are clean, 14how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself unblemished to God, purify ourb consciences from works of death, so that we may serve the living God!"
Hebrews,9,15,"Therefore Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, now that He has died to redeem them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant."
Hebrews,9,16,"In the case of a will, it is necessary to establish the death of the one who made it, 17because a will does not take effect until the one who made it has died; it cannot be executed while he is still alive."
Hebrews,9,18,That is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.
Hebrews,9,19,"For when Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the Law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people, 20saying, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.”c"
Hebrews,9,21,"In the same way, he sprinkled with blood the tabernacle and all the vessels used in"
Hebrews,9,22,"According to the Law, in fact, nearly everything must be purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness."
Hebrews,9,23,So it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these
Hebrews,9,24,"For Christ did not enter a man-made copy of the true sanctuary, but He entered heaven itself, now to appear on our behalf in the presence of God."
Hebrews,9,25,"Nor did He enter heaven to offer Himself again and again, as the high priest enters the"
Hebrews,9,26,"Otherwise, He would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now He has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself."
Hebrews,9,27,"Just as man is appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment, 28so also Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many; and He will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await Him. a 11 BYZ and TR that are to come b 14 BYZ and TR your c 20 Exodus 24:8"

Hebrews,10,2,"If it could, would not the offerings have ceased? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all and would no longer feel the guilt of their sins."
Hebrews,10,3,"Instead, those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, 4because it is impossible for the"
Hebrews,10,5,"Therefore, when Christ came into the world, He said: “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You prepared for me."

Hebrews,10,8,"In the passage above He says, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not desire, nor did You delight in them” (although they are required by the Law)."
Hebrews,10,9,"Then He adds, “Here I am, I have come to do Your will.” He takes away the first to"

Hebrews,10,13,"Since that time, He waits for His enemies to be made a footstool for His feet, 14because by a single offering He has made perfect for all time those who are sanctified."
Hebrews,10,15,"The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First He says: 16“This is the covenant I will make with them after those days, says the Lord. I will put My Laws in their hearts and inscribe them on their minds.”b"
Hebrews,10,17,Then he adds: “Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.”c
Hebrews,10,18,"And where these have been forgiven, an offering for sin is no longer needed. A Call to Persevere (Jude 1:17-23)"
Hebrews,10,19,"Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, 20by the new and living way opened for us through the curtain of His body, 21and since we have a high priest over the house of God, 22let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and our bodies washed with pure water."

Hebrews,10,31,It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews,10,32,"Remember the early days that you were in the light, when you endured a great conflict"
Hebrews,10,33,Sometimes you were publicly exposed to ridicule and
Hebrews,10,34,"You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, knowing that you yourselves had a better and permanent possession."
Hebrews,10,35,So do not throw away your confidence; it holds a great reward.
Hebrews,10,36,"You need to persevere,"
Hebrews,10,37,"For, “In just a very while little, He who is coming will come and will not delay."
Hebrews,10,38,"But My righteous onef will live by faith; and if he shrinks back, I will take no pleasure in him.”g"
Hebrews,10,39,"But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls. a 5-7 Psalm 40:6-8 b 16 Jeremiah 31:33 c 17 Jeremiah 31:34 d 30 Deuteronomy 32:35 e 30 Deuteronomy 32:36; Psalm 135:14 f 38 BYZ and TR But the righteous g 38 Habakkuk 2:3,4"

Hebrews,11,5,"By faith Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death. He could not be found, because God had taken him away.a For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God."
Hebrews,11,6,"And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who approaches Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him."
Hebrews,11,7,"By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in godly fear built an ark to save his family. By faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. The Faith of Abraham and Sarah (Genesis 15:1-7; Romans 4:1-12; Galatians 3:1-9; James 2:14-26)"
