Joshua,6,25,"But Rahab the prostitute, her father’s household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."

Joshua,6,27,So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.
Joshua,7,1,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against the children of Israel."
Joshua,7,2,"Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke"

Joshua,7,7,"Joshua said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to"
Joshua,7,8,"Oh, Lord, what"
Joshua,7,9,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?”"
Joshua,7,10,"Yahweh said to Joshua, “Get up! Why are you fallen on your face like that?"
Joshua,7,11,"Israel has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it among their own"
Joshua,7,12,"Therefore the children of Israel can’t stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you. 13“Get up! Sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, “There is a devoted thing in the midst of you, Israel.

Joshua,7,25,"Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you this day.” All Israel stoned him"
Joshua,7,26,They raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called “The valley of Achor” to this day.

They offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh,"
Joshua,8,32,"He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he"
Joshua,8,33,"All Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who carried the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, the foreigner as well as the native; half of them in front of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first,"
Joshua,8,34,"Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing"
Joshua,8,35,"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua didn’t read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them."
Joshua,9,1,"It happened, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard of it 2that they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord."
Joshua,9,3,"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai, 4they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins, old and torn and bound up, 5and old and patched shoes on their feet, and"
Joshua,9,6,"They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country. Now"
Joshua,9,7,"The men of Israel said to the Hivites, “What if you live among"
Joshua,9,8,"They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” Joshua"
Joshua,9,9,"They said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of Yahweh your God; for we have heard of his fame, all that he did in Egypt, 10and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the"
Joshua,9,11,"Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provision in your hand for the journey, and"
Joshua,9,12,"This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you; but now,"
Joshua,9,13,"These wineskins, which we filled, were new; and behold, they are torn. These our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey.”"
Joshua,9,14,"The men sampled their provisions, and didn’t ask counsel from the mouth of Yahweh."
Joshua,9,15,"Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live. The princes of the congregation swore to them."
Joshua,9,16,"It happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard"
Joshua,9,17,"The children of Israel traveled and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath"
Joshua,9,18,"The children of Israel didn’t strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn"
Joshua,9,19,"But all the princes said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel: now"
Joshua,9,20,"This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us,"
Joshua,9,21,"The princes said to them, “Let them live, so they became wood cutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them.”"
Joshua,9,22,"Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are"
Joshua,9,23,"Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you will never fail to be bondservants, both wood cutters and drawers of water for the house of my God.”"
Joshua,9,24,"They answered Joshua, and said, “Because your servants were certainly told how Yahweh your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. Therefore we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing."
Joshua,9,25,"Now, behold, we are in your hand. Do to us as it seems good and right to you to do.”"
Joshua,9,26,He did so to
Joshua,9,27,"That day Joshua made them wood cutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place which he should choose."
Joshua,10,1,"Now it happened when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them; 2that they were very afraid, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater"
Joshua,10,3,"Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, 4“Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with"
Joshua,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it."
Joshua,10,6,"The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, “Don’t abandon your servants! Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country"
Joshua,10,7,"So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with"

Joshua,10,10,"Yahweh confused them before Israel, and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck"
Joshua,10,11,"It happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth Horon, that Yahweh cast down great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than who the children of Israel killed with the sword."
Joshua,10,12,"Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, “Sun, stand still on Gibeon! You, moon, stop in the valley of Aijalon!”"
Joshua,10,13,"The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Isn’t this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of the sky, and didn’t hurry to go down about a whole day."
Joshua,10,14,"There was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought for Israel."
Joshua,10,15,"Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal. The Victory at Makkedah"
Joshua,10,16,"These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah."
Joshua,10,17,"Joshua was told, saying, “The"

Joshua,10,20,"It happened, when Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities, 21that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel."
Joshua,10,22,"Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me.”"
Joshua,10,23,"They did so, and brought those five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of"

Joshua,10,25,"Joshua said to them, “Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and courageous, for Yahweh will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight.”"
Joshua,10,26,"Afterward Joshua struck them, put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. They were hanging"
Joshua,10,27,"It happened at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day."
Joshua,10,28,"Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king. He utterly destroyed them and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining. He did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho. Conquest of the Southern Cities"
Joshua,10,29,"Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah."
Joshua,10,30,"Yahweh delivered it also, with its king, into the hand of Israel. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining in it. He did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho."
Joshua,10,31,"Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought"
Joshua,10,32,"Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel. He took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with all the souls who were in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah."
Joshua,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining."
Joshua,10,34,"Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it fought"
Joshua,10,35,"They took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish."
Joshua,10,36,"Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it."
Joshua,10,37,"They took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king and all its cities, and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls who were in it."
Joshua,10,38,"Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it."
Joshua,10,39,"He took it, with its king and all its cities. They struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining. As he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king."
Joshua,10,40,"So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings. He left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Yahweh, the God"

Joshua,11,6,"Yahweh said to Joshua, “Don’t be afraid because of them; for tomorrow at this time, I will deliver"

He took all their kings, struck"

Joshua,11,20,"For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
Joshua,11,21,"Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel: Joshua utterly"

Joshua,12,7,"These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir. Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions; 8in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 9the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one; 10the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 11the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 12the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 13the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 14the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 15the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 16the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 17the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 18the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one; 19the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; 20the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; 21the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 22the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one; 23the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one; 24the king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty-one."
Joshua,13,1,"Now Joshua was old and well advanced in years. Yahweh said to him, “You are old and advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed. 2“This is the land that still remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites; 3from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border of Ekron northward, which is counted as Canaanite; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim, 4on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the border of the Amorites; 5and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath; 6all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel:"

Joshua,13,8,"With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them: 9from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon; 10and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon; 11and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah; 12all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses attacked these,"

Ruth,1,12,"Go back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, ‘I have hope,’ if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons; 13would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Yahweh has gone out against me.”"
Ruth,1,14,"They lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her."
Ruth,1,15,"She said, “Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people, and to her god. Follow your sister-"

Ruth,1,21,"I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty; why do you call me Naomi, since Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?”"
Ruth,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest."
Ruth,2,1,"Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his"

Ruth,2,3,"She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to come to the portion"
Ruth,2,4,"Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem,"
Ruth,2,5,Then Boaz
Ruth,2,6,"The servant who was set over the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country"
Ruth,2,7,"She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little in the house.”"
Ruth,2,8,"Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from"
Ruth,2,9,"Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven’t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels,"
Ruth,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge"
Ruth,2,11,"Boaz answered her, “It has fully been shown me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and"

Ruth,2,13,"Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.”"
Ruth,2,14,"At meal time Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.” She sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was satisfied, and"
Ruth,2,15,"When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her"
Ruth,2,16,"Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.”"
Ruth,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was"
Ruth,2,18,"She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed."
Ruth,2,19,"Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.” She showed her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, “The"

Ruth,2,22,"Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they"
Ruth,2,23,"So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law."
Ruth,3,1,"Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well"
Ruth,3,2,"Now isn’t Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley"
Ruth,3,3,"Therefore wash yourself, anoint yourself, get dressed, and go down to the threshing floor, but don’t make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking."
Ruth,3,4,"It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in,"
Ruth,3,5,"She said to her, “All that you say I will do.”"
Ruth,3,6,"She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law told her."
Ruth,3,7,"When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. She came softly, uncovered his feet, and laid her down."
Ruth,3,8,"It happened at midnight, that the man was startled and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at"
Ruth,3,9,"He said, “Who are you?” She answered, “I am Ruth your handmaid. Therefore spread your"
Ruth,3,10,"He said, “Blessed are you by Yahweh, my daughter. You have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you"
Ruth,3,11,"Now, my daughter, don’t be afraid; I will do to you"
Ruth,3,12,Now it is true
Ruth,3,13,"Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform for you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part. But if he will not do the part of a kinsman for you, then will I do the part of a kinsman for you, as Yahweh lives. Lie down until the morning.”"
Ruth,3,14,"She lay at his feet until the morning. She rose up before one could discern another. For he said, “Let"
Ruth,3,15,"He said, “Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it.” She held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her; and he went"
Ruth,3,16,"When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “How did it go, my daughter?” She told"
Ruth,3,17,"She said, “He gave me these six measures of barley; for he"
Ruth,3,18,"Then she said, “Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has finished the thing this day.”"
Ruth,4,1,"Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there. Behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, “Come over here, friend, and sit down!” He turned aside, and sat down."
Ruth,4,2,"He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, “Sit down here.” They sat down."
Ruth,4,3,"He said to the near kinsman, “Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land,"
Ruth,4,4,"I thought to disclose it to you, saying, ‘Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people.’ If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know. For there is no one to redeem it besides you; and I am after you.”"
Ruth,4,5,"Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead"
Ruth,4,6,"The near kinsman said, “I can’t redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can’t redeem it.”"
Ruth,4,7,"Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man took off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the way of"
Ruth,4,8,"So the near kinsman said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.” He took off his shoe."
Ruth,4,9,"Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, “You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that"
Ruth,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate"
Ruth,4,11,"All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel; and treat you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in"
Ruth,4,12,"Let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give you of this young woman.” Boaz Marries Ruth"
Ruth,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh gave her conception,"
Ruth,4,14,"The women said to Naomi, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you this day"
Ruth,4,15,"He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.”"
Ruth,4,16,"Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it."
Ruth,4,17,"The women, her neighbors, gave him a name, saying, “There is a son born to Naomi;” and they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David. The Line of David (Matthew 1:1–17; Luke 3:23–38)"
Ruth,4,18,"Now this is the history of the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron, 19and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab, 20and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon, 21and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed, 22and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David."
1 Samuel,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite: 2and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
1 Samuel,1,3,This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Armies in
1 Samuel,1,4,"When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 5but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb."
1 Samuel,1,6,"Her rival provoked her severely, to make her fret, because Yahweh had shut up her womb."
1 Samuel,1,7,"As he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Yahweh, so she provoked her; therefore she"
1 Samuel,1,8,"Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why don’t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” Hannah Prays for a Son"
1 Samuel,1,9,"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was"
1 Samuel,1,10,"She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed"
1 Samuel,1,11,"She vowed a vow, and said, “Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a boy, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.”"
1 Samuel,1,12,"It happened, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli saw her mouth."
1 Samuel,1,13,"Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she had been"
1 Samuel,1,14,"Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunken? Put away your wine from you.”"
1 Samuel,1,15,"Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong"
1 Samuel,1,16,Don’t count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for
1 Samuel,1,17,"Then Eli answered,"
1 Samuel,1,18,"She said, “Let your handmaid find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn’t sad any more. The Birth of Samuel"
1 Samuel,1,19,"They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their"
1 Samuel,1,20,"It happened, when the time had come, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked him of Yahweh.”"
1 Samuel,1,21,"The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and his vow."
1 Samuel,1,22,"But Hannah didn’t go up; for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring"
1 Samuel,1,23,"Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may Yahweh establish his word.”"
1 Samuel,1,24,"When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him"
1 Samuel,1,25,"They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli."
1 Samuel,1,26,"She said, “Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying"
1 Samuel,1,27,For this child I prayed; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him.
1 Samuel,1,28,Therefore also I have granted him to Yahweh. As long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh.” He worshiped Yahweh there.
1 Samuel,2,1,"Hannah prayed, and said: “My heart exults in Yahweh! My horn is exalted in Yahweh. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation."
1 Samuel,2,2,"There is no one as holy as Yahweh, For there is no one besides you, nor is there any rock like our God. 3“Talk no more so exceeding proudly. Don’t let arrogance come out of your mouth, For Yahweh is a God of knowledge. By him actions are weighed. 4“The bows of the mighty men are broken. Those who stumbled are armed with strength."
1 Samuel,2,5,"Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread. Those who were hungry are satisfied. Yes, the barren has borne seven. She who has many children languishes. 6“Yahweh kills, and makes alive. He brings down to Sheol, and brings up."
1 Samuel,2,7,"Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich. He brings low, he also lifts up."
1 Samuel,2,8,"He raises up the poor out of the dust. He lifts up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh’s. He has set the world on them."
1 Samuel,2,9,"He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for no man shall prevail by strength."
1 Samuel,2,10,"Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces. He will thunder against them in the sky. “Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.”"
1 Samuel,2,11,Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served Yahweh before Eli the priest. Eli’s Wicked Sons
1 Samuel,2,12,Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn’t know Yahweh.
1 Samuel,2,13,"The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand; 14and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came"
1 Samuel,2,15,"Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed,"
1 Samuel,2,16,"If the man said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires;” then he would"
1 Samuel,2,17,The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.
1 Samuel,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod."
1 Samuel,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her"
1 Samuel,2,20,"Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, “Yahweh give you seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh.” They went to their own home."
1 Samuel,2,21,"Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before Yahweh."
1 Samuel,2,22,"Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the"
1 Samuel,2,23,"He said to them, “Why do you do such things?"
1 Samuel,2,24,"No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear:"
1 Samuel,2,25,"If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Yahweh, who shall entreat for him?” Notwithstanding, they didn’t listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh intended to kill them."
1 Samuel,2,26,"The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men. A Prophecy against the House of Eli"
1 Samuel,2,27,"A man of God came to Eli, and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Did I reveal myself to the house of"
1 Samuel,2,28,"Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me?"
1 Samuel,2,29,"Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?’ 30“Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever.’ But now Yahweh says, ‘Be it far from me; for those who honor"

1 Samuel,3,1,The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli. The word of Yahweh was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.
1 Samuel,3,2,"It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see), 3and the lamp of God hadn’t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark of God was; 4that Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, “Here I am.”"
1 Samuel,3,5,"He ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” He said, “I didn’t call; lie down again.” He"

1 Samuel,8,10,Samuel told all the words of Yahweh to the people who asked of him a king.

1 Samuel,9,2,"He had a son, whose name was Saul, an impressive young man; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he. From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people."

1 Samuel,9,14,"They went up to the city. As they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place."
1 Samuel,9,15,"Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying, 16“Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people,"

1 Samuel,9,24,"The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. Samuel said, “Behold, that which has been reserved! Set it before yourself and eat; because for the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, ‘I have invited the people.’” So Saul ate with Samuel that day."
1 Samuel,9,25,"When they had come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop."
1 Samuel,9,26,"They arose early: and it happened about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, “Get up, that I may send you away.” Saul arose, and they went out both of them,"

1 Samuel,10,17,"Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah; 18and he said to the children of Israel, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:’ 19but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, ‘No! Set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes, and by your thousands.”"
1 Samuel,10,20,"So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken."

1 Samuel,13,3,"Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying,"
1 Samuel,13,4,"All Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal."
1 Samuel,13,5,"The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude: and they came up,"
1 Samuel,13,6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and"
1 Samuel,13,7,"Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. Saul’s Unlawful Sacrifice"
1 Samuel,13,8,"He stayed seven days, according to the time set by Samuel: but Samuel didn’t come to Gilgal; and"
1 Samuel,13,9,"Saul said, “Bring here the burnt offering to me, and the peace offerings.” He offered the burnt offering."
1 Samuel,13,10,"It came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel"
1 Samuel,13,11,"Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn’t come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash; 12therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven’t entreated the favor of Yahweh.’"
1 Samuel,13,13,"Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you; for"
1 Samuel,13,14,"But now your kingdom shall not continue. Yahweh has sought for himself a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you.”"
1 Samuel,13,15,"Samuel arose, and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men. Israel without Weapons"
1 Samuel,13,16,"Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin:"
1 Samuel,13,17,"The spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual; 18and another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness."
1 Samuel,13,19,"Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears;” 20but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, mattock, axe, and sickle; 21yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the"
1 Samuel,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with"
1 Samuel,13,23,The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
1 Samuel,14,1,"Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on the other side.” But he didn’t tell his father."
1 Samuel,14,2,"Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people who were with him were about six hundred men; 3and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The"
1 Samuel,14,4,"Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other"
1 Samuel,14,5,"The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba."
1 Samuel,14,6,"Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no restraint on Yahweh to"
1 Samuel,14,7,"His armor bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Turn and, behold,"
1 Samuel,14,8,"Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will pass over to the men,"
1 Samuel,14,9,"If they say thus to us, ‘Wait until we come to you!’ then we will"
1 Samuel,14,10,"But if they say this, ‘Come up to us!’ then we will"
1 Samuel,14,11,"Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, “Behold, the Hebrews"
1 Samuel,14,12,"The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something!” Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up after me; for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.”"
1 Samuel,14,13,"Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell"
1 Samuel,14,14,"That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land."
1 Samuel,14,15,"There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling."
1 Samuel,14,16,"The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and"
1 Samuel,14,17,"Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Count now, and see who is missing"
1 Samuel,14,18,"Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God was with the children of Israel at that time."
1 Samuel,14,19,"It happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines"
1 Samuel,14,20,"Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and behold, every man’s sword"
1 Samuel,14,21,"Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before, and who went up with them into the camp, from all around, even they also turned to be with"
1 Samuel,14,22,"Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also"
1 Samuel,14,23,So Yahweh saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth Aven. Jonathan Eats the Honey
1 Samuel,14,24,"The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am avenged of my enemies.” So none of the people"
1 Samuel,14,25,All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.
1 Samuel,14,26,"When the people had come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for"
1 Samuel,14,27,"But Jonathan didn’t hear when his father commanded the people with the oath: therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb,"
1 Samuel,14,28,"Then one of the people answered, and said, “Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who"
1 Samuel,14,29,"Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land."
1 Samuel,14,30,"How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? For now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.”"
1 Samuel,14,31,"They struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint; 32and the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground;"
1 Samuel,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against Yahweh, in that they eat meat with the blood.” He said, “You have dealt treacherously. Roll a"
1 Samuel,14,34,"Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, ‘Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and don’t sin against Yahweh in eating meat with the blood.’” All the people brought every man his ox with him that night,"
1 Samuel,14,35,Saul built an altar to Yahweh. This was the first altar that he built to Yahweh.
1 Samuel,14,36,"Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.” They said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” Then the priest said, “Let us draw near here to God.” The People Save Jonathan"
1 Samuel,14,37,"Saul asked counsel of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand"
1 Samuel,14,38,"Saul said, “Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people;"
1 Samuel,14,39,"For, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people who"
1 Samuel,14,40,"Then he said to all Israel, “You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on"
1 Samuel,14,41,"Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, “Show the right.” Jonathan and Saul were chosen; but the people escaped."
1 Samuel,14,42,"Saul said, “Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.” Jonathan was selected."
1 Samuel,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done!” Jonathan told him, and said, “I certainly"
1 Samuel,14,44,Saul
1 Samuel,14,45,"The people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day!” So the people rescued"
1 Samuel,14,46,Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place. Saul’s Victories
1 Samuel,14,47,"Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah,"
1 Samuel,14,48,"He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them."
1 Samuel,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: 50and the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was Abner the"
1 Samuel,14,51,Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
1 Samuel,14,52,"There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to him."
1 Samuel,15,1,"Samuel said to Saul, “Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel. Now"
1 Samuel,15,2,"Thus says Yahweh of Armies, ‘I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of"
1 Samuel,15,3,"Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don’t spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”"
1 Samuel,15,4,"Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten"
1 Samuel,15,5,"Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley."
1 Samuel,15,6,"Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed"
1 Samuel,15,7,"Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before"
1 Samuel,15,8,"He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the"
1 Samuel,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and wouldn’t utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly. Samuel Denounces Saul"
1 Samuel,15,10,"Then the word of Yahweh came to Samuel, saying, 11“It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.” Samuel"
1 Samuel,15,12,"Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, and"
1 Samuel,15,13,"Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, “You"
1 Samuel,15,14,"Samuel said, “Then what"
1 Samuel,15,15,"Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and"
1 Samuel,15,16,"Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me last night.” He said to him, “Say on.”"
1 Samuel,15,17,"Samuel said, “Though you were little in your own sight, weren’t you made the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel; 18and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, ‘Go, and"
1 Samuel,15,19,"Why then didn’t you obey the voice of Yahweh, but took the spoils, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?”"
1 Samuel,15,20,"Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone the way which Yahweh"
1 Samuel,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and cattle, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.”"
1 Samuel,15,22,"Samuel said, “Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams."
1 Samuel,15,23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king.” Saul’s Confession"
1 Samuel,15,24,"Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your"
1 Samuel,15,25,"Now therefore, please pardon my sin,"
1 Samuel,15,26,"Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over"
1 Samuel,15,27,"As Samuel turned about to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore."
1 Samuel,15,28,"Samuel said to him, “Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor"
1 Samuel,15,29,Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a

1 Samuel,15,31,So Samuel went back with Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.
1 Samuel,15,32,"Then Samuel said, “Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites!” Agag came to him cheerfully."
1 Samuel,15,33,"Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women!” Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,34,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel,15,35,Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Yahweh grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.
1 Samuel,16,1,"Yahweh said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided"
1 Samuel,16,2,"Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.”"
1 Samuel,16,3,"Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.”"
1 Samuel,16,4,"Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet"
1 Samuel,16,5,"He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice."
1 Samuel,16,6,"It happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliab, and said, “Surely Yahweh’s anointed is"
1 Samuel,16,7,"But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Don’t look on his face, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for I see not as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but"
1 Samuel,16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said,"
1 Samuel,16,9,"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, “Neither has"
1 Samuel,16,10,"Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse,"
1 Samuel,16,11,"Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your children here?” He said, “There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is keeping the sheep.” Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and get him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.”"
1 Samuel,16,12,"He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look"
1 Samuel,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. David Serves Saul"
1 Samuel,16,14,"Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him."
1 Samuel,16,15,Saul’s
1 Samuel,16,16,"Let our lord now command your servants who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. It shall happen,"
1 Samuel,16,17,Saul
1 Samuel,16,18,"Then one of the young men answered, and said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a comely person; and"
1 Samuel,16,19,"Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me David your son,"
1 Samuel,16,20,"Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a young"
1 Samuel,16,21,"David came to Saul, and stood before him. He loved"
1 Samuel,16,22,"Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand"
1 Samuel,16,23,"It happened, when the spirit from God was on Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."
1 Samuel,17,1,Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at
1 Samuel,17,2,"Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle"
1 Samuel,17,3,"The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood"
1 Samuel,17,4,"There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span."
1 Samuel,17,5,"He had a helmet of brass on his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat"
1 Samuel,17,6,"He had brass shin armor on his legs, and a javelin of brass"
1 Samuel,17,7,The staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed
1 Samuel,17,8,"He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, “Why have you come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine,"
1 Samuel,17,9,"If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him,"
1 Samuel,17,10,"The Philistine said, “I defy the armies of Israel this day!"
1 Samuel,17,11,"When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. David Accepts the Challenge"
1 Samuel,17,12,"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had"
1 Samuel,17,13,The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons who went to the battle

1 Samuel,17,21,"Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army."
1 Samuel,17,22,"David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and"
1 Samuel,17,23,"As he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them."
1 Samuel,17,24,"All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were terrified."
1 Samuel,17,25,"The men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? He has surely come up to defy Israel. It shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.”"
1 Samuel,17,26,"David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he"
1 Samuel,17,27,"The people answered him in this way, saying, “So shall it be done to the man who kills him.”"
1 Samuel,17,28,"Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you have come down that you"
1 Samuel,17,29,"David said, “What have I now done? Is there not a cause?”"
1 Samuel,17,30,"He turned away from him toward another, and spoke like that again; and the people answered him again the same way."
1 Samuel,17,31,"When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for"
1 Samuel,17,32,"David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with"

1 Samuel,17,37,"David said, “Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.” Saul said to David, “Go; and Yahweh shall be with you.” David Slays Goliath"

1 Samuel,17,40,"He took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag which he had, even in his wallet. His sling was in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine."
1 Samuel,17,41,The Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.
1 Samuel,17,42,"When the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and"
1 Samuel,17,43,"The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with"
1 Samuel,17,44,"The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will"

1 Samuel,17,46,"Today, Yahweh will deliver you into my hand. I will strike you, and take your head from off you. I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, 47and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn’t save with sword and spear: for the battle is Yahweh’s, and he will give you into our hand.”"
1 Samuel,17,48,"It happened, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried,"
1 Samuel,17,49,"David put his hand in his bag, took a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth."

1 Samuel,17,55,"When Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army,"
1 Samuel,17,56,"The king said,"
1 Samuel,17,57,"As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner"
1 Samuel,17,58,"Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, you young man?” David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”"
1 Samuel,18,1,"It happened, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with"

1 Samuel,18,5,"David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants."
1 Samuel,18,6,"It happened as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music."
1 Samuel,18,7,"The women sang one to another as they played, and said, “Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands.”"
1 Samuel,18,8,"Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands. What can he have more but the kingdom?”"
1 Samuel,18,9,Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
1 Samuel,18,10,"It happened on the next day, that an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house. David played with his hand, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand; 11and Saul threw the spear; for he said, “I will pin David even to the wall!” David escaped from his presence twice."
1 Samuel,18,12,"Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him, and was departed from Saul."

2 Samuel,12,1,"Yahweh sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor."
2 Samuel,12,2,"The rich man had very many flocks and herds, 3but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter."
2 Samuel,12,4,"A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man who had come to him.”"

2 Samuel,12,26,"Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city."
2 Samuel,12,27,"Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah. Yes, I have taken the city of waters."

2 Samuel,13,2,Amnon was so troubled that he fell sick because of his sister
2 Samuel,13,3,"But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle"

2 Samuel,13,5,"Jonadab said to him, “Lay down on your bed, and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it"
2 Samuel,13,6,"So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”"

2 Samuel,13,14,"However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her."
2 Samuel,13,15,Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was

2 Samuel,13,23,"It happened after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons."

2 Samuel,13,39,"King David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead."
2 Samuel,14,1,Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.

2 Samuel,14,8,"The king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you.”"
2 Samuel,14,9,"The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house;"

2 Samuel,14,19,"The king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” The woman answered, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab, he urged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid; 20to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing. My lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.”"

2 Samuel,17,21,"It happened, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, “Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled"
2 Samuel,17,22,"Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan."
2 Samuel,17,23,"When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father."

2 Samuel,18,6,So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
2 Samuel,18,7,"The people of Israel were struck there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there"
2 Samuel,18,8,For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

2 Samuel,18,27,"The watchman said, “I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” The king said, “He is a good man, and comes with good news.”"

2 Samuel,18,33,"The king was much moved, and went up to the room over the gate, and wept. As he went, he said, “My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son!”"
2 Samuel,19,1,"It was told Joab, “Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.”"
2 Samuel,19,2,"The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people; for the people heard it said that day, “The king grieves for his son.”"

1 Kings,15,18,"Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben Hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying, 19“There is a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of"
1 Kings,15,20,"Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth,"
1 Kings,15,21,"It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah,"
1 Kings,15,22,"Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. Jehoshaphat Succeeds Asa (2 Chronicles 17:1–19)"
1 Kings,15,23,"Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age"
1 Kings,15,24,"Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place. Nadab Reigns in Israel"
1 Kings,15,25,Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and

1 Kings,15,27,"Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon."
1 Kings,15,28,"Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha killed him, and reigned in his place."
1 Kings,15,29,"It happened that, as soon as he was king, he struck all the house of Jeroboam: he didn’t leave to Jeroboam any who breathed, until he had destroyed him; according to the saying of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite; 30for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger."
1 Kings,15,31,"Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,15,32,There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. Baasha Reigns in Israel
1 Kings,15,33,"In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in"
1 Kings,15,34,"He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin."
1 Kings,16,1,"The word of Yahweh came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying, 2“Because I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins; 3behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam"
1 Kings,16,4,The dogs will eat Baasha’s descendants who die in the city; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat.”
1 Kings,16,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
1 Kings,16,6,"Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his place."
1 Kings,16,7,"Moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of Yahweh against Baasha, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck him. Elah Reigns in Israel"
1 Kings,16,8,"In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in"
1 Kings,16,9,"His servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah: 10and Zimri went in and struck him, and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah,"
1 Kings,16,11,"It happened, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he struck all the house of Baasha: he didn’t leave him a single one who urinates on a wall, neither of his relatives, nor of his friends."
1 Kings,16,12,"Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, 13for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and with which they made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger"
1 Kings,16,14,"Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? Zimri Reigns in Israel"
1 Kings,16,15,"In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the people"
1 Kings,16,16,"The people who were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also struck the king: therefore all Israel made Omri,"
1 Kings,16,17,"Omri went up from Gibbethon, and"
1 Kings,16,18,"It happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died, 19for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, in walking in"
1 Kings,16,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he committed, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? Omri Reigns in Israel"
1 Kings,16,21,Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of

1 Kings,16,25,"Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and dealt wickedly above all who were before"
1 Kings,16,26,"For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made"

1 Kings,16,28,"So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his place. Ahab Reigns in Israel, Marries Jezebel"
1 Kings,16,29,In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and
1 Kings,16,30,Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh above all that were before him.
1 Kings,16,31,"It happened, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal,"
1 Kings,16,32,"He reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria."
1 Kings,16,33,"Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than"
1 Kings,16,34,"In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho: he laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun."
1 Kings,17,1,"Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the foreigners of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.”"

1 Kings,17,4,"It shall be, that you shall drink of the brook. I have"
1 Kings,17,5,So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh; for
1 Kings,17,6,The ravens brought him bread and

1 Kings,17,8,"The word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 9“Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay"
1 Kings,17,10,"So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called"

1 Kings,17,13,"Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do as you have said; but make me of it a little cake"
1 Kings,17,14,"For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘The jar of meal shall not empty, neither shall the jar of oil fail, until the"
1 Kings,17,15,She went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and
1 Kings,17,16,"The jar of meal didn’t empty, neither did the jar of oil fail, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by Elijah. Elijah Raises the Widow’s Son"
1 Kings,17,17,"It happened after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and"
1 Kings,17,18,"She said to Elijah, “What have I to do with you, you man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to memory, and to kill my son!”"
1 Kings,17,19,"He said to her, “Give me your son.” He took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the room"
1 Kings,17,20,"He cried to Yahweh, and said, “Yahweh my God,"
1 Kings,17,21,"He stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to Yahweh, and said, “Yahweh my God, please let this child’s soul"
1 Kings,17,22,Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him
1 Kings,17,23,"Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the room into the house,"
1 Kings,17,24,"The woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth.”"
1 Kings,18,1,"It happened after many days, that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, “Go,"
1 Kings,18,2,Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. The

1 Kings,18,5,"Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks. Perhaps we"
1 Kings,18,6,"So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself."
1 Kings,18,7,"As Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and"
1 Kings,18,8,"He answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here!’”"
1 Kings,18,9,"He said, “Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill"
1 Kings,18,10,"As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you. When they said, ‘He is not here,’ he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they didn’t find"
1 Kings,18,11,"Now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’"
1 Kings,18,12,"It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you I don’t know where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he can’t find you, he will kill me. But I, your servant, have feared Yahweh from my youth."
1 Kings,18,13,"Wasn’t it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred"
1 Kings,18,14,"Now you say,"
1 Kings,18,15,"Elijah said, “As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.” Elijah on Mount Carmel"
1 Kings,18,16,"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah."
1 Kings,18,17,"It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?”"
1 Kings,18,18,"He answered, “I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father’s house, in that you have forsaken the"
1 Kings,18,19,"Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and four hundred fifty of the prophets of Baal, and four hundred of the prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”"
1 Kings,18,20,"So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel."
1 Kings,18,21,"Elijah came near to all the people, and said, “How long will you waver between the two sides? If"

1 Kings,18,25,"Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are"
1 Kings,18,26,"They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any who answered. They leaped about the altar which was"
1 Kings,18,27,"It happened at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, “Cry aloud; for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he has gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened.”"
1 Kings,18,28,"They cried aloud, and cut themselves in their way with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out"
1 Kings,18,29,"It was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any who regarded."
1 Kings,18,30,"Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me;” and all the people came near to him. He repaired"
1 Kings,18,31,"Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of Yahweh came, saying, “Israel shall be your name.”"
1 Kings,18,32,"With the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh. He made a trench around the altar, large"

1 Kings,18,41,"Elijah said to Ahab, “Get up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.”"
1 Kings,18,42,So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the

1 Kings,18,44,"It happened at the seventh time, that he said, “Behold, a small cloud, like a man’s hand, is rising out of the sea.”"
1 Kings,18,45,"It happened in a little while, that the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. Ahab rode,"
1 Kings,18,46,The hand of Yahweh was on Elijah; and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
1 Kings,19,1,"Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword."
1 Kings,19,2,"Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I don’t"

1 Kings,19,11,"He said, “Go out, and stand on the mountain before Yahweh.” Behold, Yahweh passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh"

1 Kings,19,19,"So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over to him, and cast his mantle on him."
1 Kings,19,20,"He left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, “Let me please kiss my father and my mother, and"
1 Kings,19,21,"He returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and served him."
1 Kings,20,1,"Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together; and there were thirty-two kings with him,"
1 Kings,20,2,"He sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said to him, “Thus says Ben Hadad, 3‘Your silver"

1 Kings,20,16,"They went out at noon. But Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings,"
1 Kings,20,17,The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first;

1 Kings,21,4,"Ahab came into his house sullen and angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” He laid himself down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread."
1 Kings,21,5,"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, “Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?”"
1 Kings,21,6,"He said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it.’ He answered, ‘I will not give"

1 Kings,21,13,"The two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him. The base fellows testified against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king!” Then they carried him out of the city, and stoned him to death with"
1 Kings,21,14,"Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned, and is dead.”"

1 Kings,21,17,"The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 18“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to"

1 Kings,21,25,"But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh,"
1 Kings,21,26,"He did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel."
1 Kings,21,27,"It happened, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh,"
1 Kings,21,28,"The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 29“See how Ahab humbles himself before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son’s days will I bring the evil on his house.”"
1 Kings,22,1,They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.

1 Kings,22,5,"Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh.”"
1 Kings,22,6,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?” They said, “Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand"

1 Kings,22,13,"The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “See now, the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak good.”"
1 Kings,22,14,"Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me, that I will speak.”"

1 Kings,22,17,"He said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. Yahweh said, ‘These have no master. Let them each return to his house in peace.’”"
1 Kings,22,18,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”"
1 Kings,22,19,"Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of Yahweh. I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the"

1 Kings,22,21,"A spirit came out and stood before Yahweh, and said, ‘I will entice him.’"
1 Kings,22,22,"Yahweh said to him, ‘How?’ He said, ‘I will go out and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ He said, ‘You will entice"
1 Kings,22,23,"Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.”"
1 Kings,22,24,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which"
1 Kings,22,25,"Micaiah said, “Behold, you will see on"

1 Kings,22,29,So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
1 Kings,22,30,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes.”"
1 Kings,22,31,"Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the"
1 Kings,22,32,"It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, “Surely that is the king of Israel!” and they turned aside to fight against him. Jehoshaphat cried out."
1 Kings,22,33,"It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him."
1 Kings,22,34,"A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn your hand, and carry me out of the battle; for I"
1 Kings,22,35,The battle increased that day. The king was propped up in his chariot facing
1 Kings,22,36,"A cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, “Every man to his city, and every man to his country!”"
1 Kings,22,37,"So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria."
1 Kings,22,38,They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed
1 Kings,22,39,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, aren’t they written in"
1 Kings,22,40,So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place. Jehoshaphat Reigns in Judah (2 Chronicles 20:31–34)
1 Kings,22,41,Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,42,Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in
1 Kings,22,43,"He walked in all the way of Asa his father; He didn’t turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh: however the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places."
1 Kings,22,44,Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1 Kings,22,45,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, aren’t"
1 Kings,22,46,"The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land."
1 Kings,22,47,There was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
1 Kings,22,48,Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir
1 Kings,22,49,"Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat would not."
1 Kings,22,50,"Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; Jehoram his son reigned in his place. Ahaziah Reigns in Israel (2 Kings 1:1–16)"
1 Kings,22,51,Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat
1 Kings,22,52,"He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam"
1 Kings,22,53,"He served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done."
2 Kings,1,1,Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2 Kings,1,2,"Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, “Go, inquire"
2 Kings,1,3,"But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them,"
2 Kings,1,4,"Now therefore thus says Yahweh, “You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.”’” Elijah departed."
2 Kings,1,5,"The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, “Why is it that you have returned?”"
2 Kings,1,6,"They said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall"
2 Kings,1,7,"He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you"
2 Kings,1,8,"They answered him, “He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.” He said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”"
2 Kings,1,9,"Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold, he was"
2 Kings,1,10,"Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,1,11,"Again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty. He answered him, “Man of God, the king"
2 Kings,1,12,"Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” The fire of God came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,1,13,"Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, “Man of God, please let my life,"
2 Kings,1,14,"Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in"
2 Kings,1,15,"The angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Don’t be afraid of him.” He"
2 Kings,1,16,"He said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.’” Jehoram Succeeds Ahaziah"
2 Kings,1,17,So he died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
2 Kings,1,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,2,1,"It happened, when Yahweh would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with"
2 Kings,2,2,"Elijah said to Elisha, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.” Elisha said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel."
2 Kings,2,3,"The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?” He said, “Yes, I know it; hold your peace.”"
2 Kings,2,4,"Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.” He said, “As Yahweh"

2 Kings,2,7,"Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both"
2 Kings,2,8,"Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they two went over on dry ground."
2 Kings,2,9,"It happened, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before"
2 Kings,2,10,"He said, “You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it"
2 Kings,2,11,"It happened, as they still went on, and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire and"

2 Kings,2,13,He took up also the mantle of Elijah that
2 Kings,2,14,"He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, “Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?” When he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha went over. Elisha Succeeds Elijah"
2 Kings,2,15,"When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him."
2 Kings,2,16,"They said to him, “See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps the Spirit of Yahweh has taken him up, and put him on some mountain, or"
2 Kings,2,17,"When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.” They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn’t find"
2 Kings,2,18,"They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go?’” Elisha Heals the Waters of Jericho"
2 Kings,2,19,"The men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord"
2 Kings,2,20,"He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in"
2 Kings,2,21,"He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or"
2 Kings,2,22,"So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke. Elisha Mocked"
2 Kings,2,23,"He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city"
2 Kings,2,24,"He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Yahweh. Two female bears came out of the woods,"
2 Kings,2,25,"He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria."
2 Kings,3,1,Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of
2 Kings,3,2,"He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father"
2 Kings,3,3,"Nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he didn’t depart from it."
2 Kings,3,4,Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one

2 Kings,3,6,King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that
2 Kings,3,7,"He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle?” He said, “I will go up."
2 Kings,3,8,"He said, “Which way shall we go up?” He answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.”"
2 Kings,3,9,"So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of"
2 Kings,3,10,"The king of Israel said, “Alas! For Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the"
2 Kings,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of Yahweh by him?” One of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Elisha the son of Shaphat is here,"
2 Kings,3,12,"Jehoshaphat said, “The word of Yahweh is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him."
2 Kings,3,13,"Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.” The king of Israel said to him, “No; for Yahweh has called these three"

2 Kings,3,21,"Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered"
2 Kings,3,22,"They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water over"
2 Kings,3,23,"They said, “This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they"
2 Kings,3,24,"When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward"
2 Kings,3,25,"They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the springs of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth only they left its stones; however the men armed with slings went about it,"
2 Kings,3,26,"When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him"
2 Kings,3,27,"Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land."
2 Kings,4,1,"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared Yahweh. Now the creditor has come"

2 Kings,4,8,"It fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread."
2 Kings,4,9,"She said to her husband, “See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us"
2 Kings,4,10,"Please let us make a little room on the wall. Let us set for him there a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand. It shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there.”"
2 Kings,4,11,"One day he came there, and he turned into the room and lay there."

2 Kings,4,14,"He said, “What then is to be done for her?” Gehazi answered, “Most certainly she has no son, and"
2 Kings,4,15,"He said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the door."
2 Kings,4,16,"He said, “At this season, when the time comes around, you will embrace a son.” She said, “No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid.”"

2 Kings,23,24,"Moreover Josiah removed those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house"
2 Kings,23,25,"Like him was there no king before him, who turned to Yahweh with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him."

2 Kings,23,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles"
2 Kings,23,29,"In his days Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and Pharaoh Necoh killed him at Megiddo,"
2 Kings,23,30,"His servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. The people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s place. Jehoahaz Succeeds Josiah (2 Chronicles 36:1–4)"
2 Kings,23,31,Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in
2 Kings,23,32,He did that
2 Kings,23,33,"Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold."
2 Kings,23,34,"Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed"
2 Kings,23,35,"Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of everyone according to his taxation, to give it to Pharaoh Necoh. Jehoiakim Reigns in Judah (2 Chronicles 36:5–8)"
2 Kings,23,36,Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in
2 Kings,23,37,"He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers had done."
2 Kings,24,1,"In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years:"
2 Kings,24,2,"Yahweh sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servants the prophets."
2 Kings,24,3,"Surely at the commandment of Yahweh came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did, 4and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he"
2 Kings,24,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Jehoiachin Reigns in Judah (2 Chronicles 36:9–10)"
2 Kings,24,6,So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,24,7,"The king of Egypt didn’t come again out of his land any more; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt."
2 Kings,24,8,Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months:
2 Kings,24,9,"He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that his father had done. The Captivity of Jerusalem (Lamentations 1:1–22)"

2 Kings,24,14,"He carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, except the poorest sort of the people of the land."
2 Kings,24,15,"He carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers,"
2 Kings,24,16,"All the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon."
2 Kings,24,17,"The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s father’s brother, king is his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah. Zedekiah Reigns in Judah (2 Chronicles 36:11–14; Jeremiah 52:1–3)"
2 Kings,24,18,Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in
2 Kings,24,19,He did that
2 Kings,24,20,"For through the anger of Yahweh, it happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon."
2 Kings,25,1,"It happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against"

2 Kings,25,7,"They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon. The Temple Destroyed (Jeremiah 52:12–23)"
2 Kings,25,8,"Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king"

2 Kings,25,17,"The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was on it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital around it, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with network. Captives Carried to Babylon (Jeremiah 52:24–30)"
2 Kings,25,18,"The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold: 19and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land,"
2 Kings,25,20,"Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to"
2 Kings,25,21,"The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land. Gedaliah Governs in Judah (Jeremiah 40:1–16)"
2 Kings,25,22,"As for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had"
2 Kings,25,23,"Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the"

2 Kings,25,27,"It happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; 28and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon, 29and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life: 30and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life."

Nehemiah,7,73,"So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, lived in their cities. When the seventh month had come, the children of Israel were in their cities."

Nehemiah,8,5,"Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up: 6and Ezra blessed Yahweh, the great God. All the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” with the lifting up of their hands."
Nehemiah,8,7,"Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stayed in their place."
Nehemiah,8,8,"They read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading."
Nehemiah,8,9,"Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said to all the people, “This day is holy to Yahweh your God. Don’t mourn, nor weep.” For all"

Nehemiah,8,13,"On the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers’ households of all the people, the"
Nehemiah,8,14,"They found written in the law, how that Yahweh had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month; 15and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain, and get olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths,"
Nehemiah,8,16,"So the people went out, and brought them, and made themselves booths, everyone on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad"
Nehemiah,8,17,"All the assembly of those who had come again out of the captivity made booths, and lived in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so. There was very great gladness."
Nehemiah,8,18,"Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. They kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance."

Nehemiah,9,4,"Then Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani of the Levites stood up on the stairs, and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless Yahweh your God from everlasting to everlasting! Bessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise!"
Nehemiah,9,6,"You are Yahweh, even you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their army, the earth and all things that are on it, the seas and all that is in them, and you preserve them all. The army of heaven worships you."
Nehemiah,9,7,"You are Yahweh, the God who chose Abram, and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham, 8and found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his seed, and have performed your words; for you are righteous. 9“You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea, 10and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of his land; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and made a name for yourself, as it is this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"Moreover, in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go. 13“You came down also on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments, 14and made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses your servant, 15and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them. 16“But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, didn’t listen to your commandments, 17and refused to obey, neither were they mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and didn’t forsake them."
Nehemiah,9,18,"Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ and had committed awful blasphemies; 19yet you in your manifold mercies didn’t forsake them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud didn’t depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go."
Nehemiah,9,20,"You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn’t withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst. 21“Yes, forty years you sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. Their clothes didn’t grow old, and their feet didn’t swell."
Nehemiah,9,22,"Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you allotted according to their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"You also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it. 24“So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they pleased."
Nehemiah,9,25,"They took fortified cities, and a rich land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns dug out, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled, became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness. 26“Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their back, and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies."
Nehemiah,9,27,"Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them. In the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore left you them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times you delivered them according to your mercies, 29and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they dealt proudly, and didn’t listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances, (which if a man does, he shall live in them), turned their backs, stiffened their neck, and would not hear."
Nehemiah,9,30,"Yet many years you put up with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet would they not give ear. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. 31“Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God."
Nehemiah,9,32,"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness, don’t let all the travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"However you are just in all that has come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly; 34neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land which you gave before them, neither did they turn from their wicked works. 36“Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good, behold, we are servants in it."
Nehemiah,9,37,"It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our livestock, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress."
Nehemiah,9,38,"Yet for all this, we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, seal it.”"

Esther,1,18,"Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s deed will tell all the king’s princes.

Esther,3,7,"In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month,"
Esther,3,8,"Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different than other people’s. They don’t keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not for the king’s profit to allow"

Esther,4,3,"In every province, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,"Esther’s maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved."
Esther,4,5,"Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go"
Esther,4,6,"So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city"
Esther,4,7,"Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the destruction"

Esther,4,9,Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther,4,10,"Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai: 11“All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden"
Esther,4,12,They told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
Esther,4,13,"Then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther, “Don’t think to yourself that you will escape in"
Esther,4,14,"For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows if you haven’t come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”"
Esther,4,15,"Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai, 16“Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.”"
Esther,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."

Esther,5,9,"Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he didn’t stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai."
Esther,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent and called for his friends"

Esther,6,14,"While they were yet talking with him, the king’s eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
Esther,7,2,"The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, “What is your petition, queen Esther? It shall be granted you."

Esther,8,2,"The king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."

Job,1,12,"Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t put forth your hand.” So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh. Job Loses His Children and Possessions"
Job,1,13,"It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house, 14that there came a messenger to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them, 15and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the"

Job,1,17,"While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the"
Job,1,18,"While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house, 19and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”"
Job,1,20,"Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped."
Job,1,21,"He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be the name of Yahweh.”"
Job,1,22,"In all this, Job did not sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing."
Job,2,1,"Again it happened on the day when the God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, that"
Job,2,2,"Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and"
Job,2,3,"Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without"

Job,2,6,"Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.”"
Job,2,7,"So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of"
Job,2,8,"He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes."
Job,2,9,"Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.”"
Job,2,10,"But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips. Job’s Three Friends"
Job,2,11,"Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an"
Job,2,12,"When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore"
Job,2,13,"So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great."
Job,3,1,"After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth."
Job,3,2,"Job answered: 3“Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’"
Job,3,4,"Let that day be darkness. Don’t let God from above seek for it, neither let the light shine on it."
Job,3,5,Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all that makes black the day terrify it.
Job,3,6,"As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months."
Job,3,7,"Behold, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come therein."
Job,3,8,"Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan."
Job,3,9,"Let the stars of its twilight be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the morning, 10because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes. 11“Why didn’t I die from the womb? Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?"
Job,3,12,"Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should nurse?"
Job,3,13,"For now should I have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept, then I would have been at rest, 14with kings and counselors of the earth, who built up waste places for themselves; 15or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver: 16or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, as infants who never saw light."
Job,3,17,There the wicked cease from troubling. There the weary are at rest.
Job,3,18,There the prisoners are at ease together. They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.
Job,3,19,"The small and the great are there. The servant is free from his master. 20“Why is light given to him who is in misery, life to the bitter in soul,"
Job,3,21,"Who long for death, but it doesn’t come; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures, 22who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?"
Job,3,23,"Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?"
Job,3,24,For my sighing comes before I eat. My groanings are poured out like water.
Job,3,25,"For the thing which I fear comes on me, That which I am afraid of comes to me."
Job,3,26,"I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; but trouble comes.”"
Job,4,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, 2“If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking?"
Job,4,3,"Behold, you have instructed many, you have strengthened the weak hands."
Job,4,4,"Your words have supported him who was falling, You have made firm the feeble knees."
Job,4,5,"But now it has come to you, and you faint. It touches you, and you are troubled."
Job,4,6,"Isn’t your piety your confidence? Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope? 7“Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?"
Job,4,8,"According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity, and sow trouble, reap the same."
Job,4,9,By the breath of God they perish. By the blast of his anger are they consumed.
Job,4,10,"The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions, are broken."
Job,4,11,The old lion perishes for lack of prey. The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad. 12“Now a thing was secretly brought to me. My ear received a whisper of it.
Job,4,13,"In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, 14fear came on me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake."
Job,4,15,Then a spirit passed before my face. The hair of my flesh stood up.
Job,4,16,"It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes. Silence, then I heard a voice, saying, 17‘Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?"
Job,4,18,"Behold, he puts no trust in his servants. He charges his angels with error."
Job,4,19,"How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth!"
Job,4,20,Between morning and evening they are destroyed. They perish forever without any regarding it.
Job,4,21,"Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.’"
Job,5,2,"For resentment kills the foolish man, and jealousy kills the simple."
Job,5,3,"I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation."
Job,5,4,"His children are far from safety. They are crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them, 5whose harvest the hungry eats up, and take it even out of the thorns. The snare gapes for their substance."
Job,5,6,"For affliction doesn’t come forth from the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground; 7but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward. 8“But as for me, I would seek God. I would commit my cause to God, 9who does great things that can’t be fathomed, marvelous things without number; 10who gives rain on the earth, and sends waters on the fields; 11so that he sets up on high those who are low, those who mourn are exalted to safety."
Job,5,12,"He frustrates the devices of the crafty, So that their hands can’t perform their enterprise."
Job,5,13,He takes the wise in their own craftiness; the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.
Job,5,14,"They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope at noonday as in the night."
Job,5,15,"But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty."
Job,5,16,"So the poor has hope, and injustice shuts her mouth. 17“Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty."
Job,5,18,"For he wounds, and binds up. He injures, and his hands make whole."
Job,5,19,"He will deliver you in six troubles; yes, in seven no evil shall touch you."
Job,5,20,"In famine he will redeem you from death; in war, from the power of the sword."
Job,5,21,"You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes."
Job,5,22,"At destruction and famine you shall laugh, neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth."
Job,5,23,For you shall be allied with the stones of the field. The animals of the field shall be at peace with you.
Job,5,24,"You shall know that your tent is in peace. You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing."
Job,5,25,"You shall know also that your seed shall be great, Your offspring as the grass of the earth."
Job,5,26,"You shall come to your grave in a full age, like a shock of grain comes in its season."
Job,5,27,"Look this, we have searched it, so it is. Hear it, and know it for your good.”"
Job,6,1,"Then Job answered, 2“Oh that my anguish were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!"
Job,6,3,"For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas, therefore have my words been rash."
Job,6,4,For the arrows of the Almighty are within me. My spirit drinks up their poison. The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
Job,6,5,Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?
Job,6,6,Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
Job,6,7,"My soul refuses to touch them. They are as loathsome food to me. 8“Oh that I might have my request, that God would grant the thing that I long for, 9even that it would please God to crush me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!"
Job,6,10,"Be it still my consolation, yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One."
Job,6,11,"What is my strength, that I should wait? What is my end, that I should be patient?"
Job,6,12,Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?
Job,6,13,"Isn’t it that I have no help in me, That wisdom is driven quite from me? 14“To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty."
Job,6,15,"My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away;"
Job,6,16,"Which are black by reason of the ice, in which the snow hides itself."
Job,6,17,"In the dry season, they vanish. When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place."
Job,6,18,"The caravans that travel beside them turn aside. They go up into the waste, and perish."
Job,6,19,The caravans of Tema looked. The companies of Sheba waited for them.
Job,6,20,"They were distressed because they were confident. They came there, and were confounded."
Job,6,21,"For now you are nothing. You see a terror, and are afraid."
Job,6,22,"Did I say, ‘Give to me?’ or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance?’ 23or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?’ or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?’ 24“Teach me, and I will hold my peace. Cause me to understand wherein I have erred."
Job,6,25,"How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what does it reprove?"
Job,6,26,"Do you intend to reprove words, since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?"
Job,6,27,"Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend."
Job,6,28,"Now therefore be pleased to look at me, for surely I shall not lie to your face."
Job,6,29,"Please return. Let there be no injustice. Yes, return again. My cause is righteous."
Job,6,30,Is there injustice on my tongue? Can’t my taste discern mischievous things?
Job,7,2,"As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, as a hireling who looks for his wages, 3so am I made to possess months of misery, wearisome nights are appointed to me."
Job,7,4,"When I lie down, I say, ‘When shall I arise, and the night be gone?’ I toss and turn until the dawning of the day."
Job,7,5,"My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh."
Job,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope."
Job,7,7,Oh remember that my life is a breath. My eye shall no more see good.
Job,7,8,"The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more. Your eyes shall be on me, but I shall not be."
Job,7,9,"As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more."
Job,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. 11“Therefore I will not keep silent. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of my soul."
Job,7,12,"Am I a sea, or a sea monster, that you put a guard over me?"
Job,7,13,"When I say, ‘My bed shall comfort me. My couch shall ease my complaint;’ 14then you scare me with dreams, and terrify me through visions: 15so that my soul chooses strangling, death rather than my bones."
Job,7,16,"I loathe my life. I don’t want to live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath."
Job,7,17,"What is man, that you should magnify him, that you should set your mind on him, 18that you should visit him every morning, and test him every moment?"
Job,7,19,"How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?"
Job,7,20,"If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men? Why have you set me as a mark for you, so that I am a burden to myself?"
Job,7,21,"Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust. You will seek me diligently, but I shall not be.”"
Job,8,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 2“How long will you speak these things? Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?"
Job,8,3,Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?
Job,8,4,"If your children have sinned against him, He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience."
Job,8,5,"If you want to seek God diligently, make your supplication to the Almighty."
Job,8,6,"If you were pure and upright, surely now he would awaken for you, and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous."
Job,8,7,"Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would greatly increase. 8“Please inquire of past generations. Find out about the learning of their fathers. 9(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days on earth are a shadow.)"
Job,8,10,"Shall they not teach you, tell you, and utter words out of their heart? 11“Can the papyrus grow up without mire? Can the rushes grow without water?"
Job,8,12,"While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down, it withers before any other reed."
Job,8,13,"So are the paths of all who forget God. The hope of the godless man shall perish,"
Job,8,14,"Whose confidence shall break apart, Whose trust is a spider’s web."
Job,8,15,"He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand. He shall cling to it, but it shall not endure."
Job,8,16,He is green before the sun. His shoots go forth over his garden.
Job,8,17,His roots are wrapped around the rock pile. He sees the place of stones.
Job,8,18,"If he is destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen you.’"
Job,8,19,"Behold, this is the joy of his way: out of the earth, others shall spring. 20“Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man, neither will he uphold the evildoers."
Job,8,21,"He will still fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting."
Job,8,22,Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame. The tent of the wicked shall be no more.”
Job,9,1,"Then Job answered, 2“Truly I know that it is so, but how can man be just with God?"
Job,9,3,"If he is pleased to contend with him, he can’t answer him one time in a thousand."
Job,9,4,"God who is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?"
Job,9,5,"He removes the mountains, and they don’t know it, when he overturns them in his anger."
Job,9,6,He shakes the earth out of its place. Its pillars tremble.
Job,9,7,"He commands the sun, and it doesn’t rise, and seals up the stars."
Job,9,8,"He alone stretches out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea."
Job,9,9,"He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the rooms of the south."
Job,9,10,"He does great things past finding out; yes, marvelous things without number."
Job,9,11,"Behold, he goes by me, and I don’t see him. He passes on also, but I don’t perceive him."
Job,9,12,"Behold, he snatches away. Who can hinder him? Who will ask him, ‘What are you doing?’ 13“God will not withdraw his anger. The helpers of Rahab stoop under him."
Job,9,14,"How much less shall I answer him, And choose my words to argue with him?"
Job,9,15,"Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn’t answer him. I would make supplication to my judge."
Job,9,16,"If I had called, and he had answered me, yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice."
Job,9,17,"For he breaks me with a storm, and multiplies my wounds without cause."
Job,9,18,"He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness."
Job,9,19,"If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty! If of justice, ‘Who,’ says he, ‘will summon me?’"
Job,9,20,"Though I am righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me. Though I am blameless, it shall prove me perverse."
Job,9,21,I am blameless. I don’t respect myself. I despise my life. 22“It is all the same. Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked.
Job,9,23,"If the scourge kills suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the innocent."
Job,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If not he, then who is it? 25“Now my days are swifter than a runner. They flee away, they see no good,"
Job,9,26,"They have passed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that swoops on the prey."
Job,9,27,"If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and cheer up;’"
Job,9,28,"I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not hold me innocent."
Job,9,29,I shall be condemned. Why then do I labor in vain?
Job,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye, 31yet you will plunge me in the ditch. My own clothes shall abhor me."
Job,9,32,"For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment."
Job,9,33,"There is no umpire between us, that might lay his hand on us both."
Job,9,34,"Let him take his rod away from me. Let his terror not make me afraid; 35then I would speak, and not fear him, for I am not so in myself."
Job,10,2,"I will tell God, ‘Do not condemn me. Show me why you contend with me."
Job,10,3,"Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and smile on the counsel of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,Do you have eyes of flesh? Or do you see as man sees?
Job,10,5,"Are your days as the days of mortals, or your years as man’s years, 6that you inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?"
Job,10,7,"Although you know that I am not wicked, there is no one who can deliver out of your hand. 8“‘Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether, yet you destroy me."
Job,10,9,"Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay. Will you bring me into dust again?"
Job,10,10,"Haven’t you poured me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese?"
Job,10,11,"You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews."
Job,10,12,You have granted me life and loving kindness. Your visitation has preserved my spirit.
Job,10,13,"Yet you hid these things in your heart. I know that this is with you: 14if I sin, then you mark me. You will not acquit me from my iniquity."
Job,10,15,"If I am wicked, woe to me. If I am righteous, I still shall not lift up my head, being filled with disgrace, and conscious of my affliction."
Job,10,16,"If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion. Again you show yourself powerful to me."
Job,10,17,"You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your indignation on me. Changes and warfare are with me. 18“‘Why, then, have you brought me forth out of the womb? I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me."
Job,10,19,I should have been as though I had not been. I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job,10,20,"Aren’t my days few? Cease then. Leave me alone, that I may find a little comfort, 21before I go where I shall not return from, to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death; 22the land dark as midnight, of the shadow of death, without any order, where the light is as midnight.’”"
Job,11,1,"Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered, 2“Shouldn’t the multitude of words be answered? Should a man full of talk be justified?"
Job,11,3,"Should your boastings make men hold their peace? When you mock, shall no man make you ashamed?"
Job,11,4,"For you say, ‘My doctrine is pure. I am clean in your eyes.’"
Job,11,5,"But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you, 6that he would show you the secrets of wisdom! For true wisdom has two sides. Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves. 7“Can you fathom the mystery of God? Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty?"
Job,11,8,They are high as heaven. What can you do? They are deeper than Sheol. What can you know?
Job,11,9,"Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea."
Job,11,10,"If he passes by, or confines, or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?"
Job,11,11,"For he knows false men. He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn’t consider it."
Job,11,12,"An empty-headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a wild donkey’s colt. 13“If you set your heart aright, stretch out your hands toward him."
Job,11,14,"If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away. Don’t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents."
Job,11,15,"Surely then you shall lift up your face without spot; Yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear: 16for you shall forget your misery. You shall remember it as waters that are passed away."
Job,11,17,"Life shall be clearer than the noonday. Though there is darkness, it shall be as the morning."
Job,11,18,"You shall be secure, because there is hope. Yes, you shall search, and shall take your rest in safety."
Job,11,19,"Also you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid. Yes, many shall court your favor."
Job,11,20,But the eyes of the wicked shall fail. They shall have no way to flee. Their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit.”
Job,12,1,"Then Job answered, 2“No doubt, but you are the people, and wisdom shall die with you."
Job,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Yes, who doesn’t know such things as these?"
Job,12,4,"I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, I, who called on God, and he answered. The just, the blameless man is a joke."
Job,12,5,In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune. It is ready for them whose foot slips.
Job,12,6,"The tents of robbers prosper. Those who provoke God are secure, who carry their God in their hands. 7“But ask the animals, now, and they shall teach you; the birds of the sky, and they shall tell you."
Job,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you. The fish of the sea shall declare to you."
Job,12,9,"Who doesn’t know that in all these, the hand of Yahweh has done this, 10in whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind?"
Job,12,11,"Doesn’t the ear try words, even as the palate tastes its food?"
Job,12,12,"With aged men is wisdom, in length of days understanding. 13“With God is wisdom and might. He has counsel and understanding."
Job,12,14,"Behold, he breaks down, and it can’t be built again. He imprisons a man, and there can be no release."
Job,12,15,"Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up. Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth."
Job,12,16,With him is strength and wisdom. The deceived and the deceiver are his.
Job,12,17,He leads counselors away stripped. He makes judges fools.
Job,12,18,He loosens the bond of kings. He binds their waist with a belt.
Job,12,19,"He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty."
Job,12,20,"He removes the speech of those who are trusted, and takes away the understanding of the elders."
Job,12,21,"He pours contempt on princes, and loosens the belt of the strong."
Job,12,22,"He uncovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death."
Job,12,23,"He increases the nations, and he destroys them. He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive."
Job,12,24,"He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way."
Job,12,25,They grope in the dark without light. He makes them stagger like a drunken man.
Job,13,2,"What you know, I know also. I am not inferior to you. 3“Surely I would speak to the Almighty. I desire to reason with God."
Job,13,4,But you are forgers of lies. You are all physicians of no value.
Job,13,5,Oh that you would be completely silent! Then you would be wise.
Job,13,6,Hear now my reasoning. Listen to the pleadings of my lips.
Job,13,7,"Will you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him?"
Job,13,8,Will you show partiality to him? Will you contend for God?
Job,13,9,"Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him?"
Job,13,10,He will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality.
Job,13,11,"Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall on you?"
Job,13,12,"Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay. 13“Be silent, leave me alone, that I may speak. Let come on me what will."
Job,13,14,"Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?"
Job,13,15,"Behold, he will kill me. I have no hope. Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him."
Job,13,16,"This also shall be my salvation, that a godless man shall not come before him."
Job,13,17,Hear diligently my speech. Let my declaration be in your ears.
Job,13,18,"See now, I have set my cause in order. I know that I am righteous."
Job,13,19,Who is he who will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit. 20“Only don’t do two things to me; then I will not hide myself from your face: 21withdraw your hand far from me; and don’t let your terror make me afraid.
Job,13,22,"Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you answer me."
Job,13,23,How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my disobedience and my sin.
Job,13,24,"Why hide you your face, and hold me for your enemy?"
Job,13,25,Will you harass a driven leaf? Will you pursue the dry stubble?
Job,13,26,"For you write bitter things against me, and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth:"
Job,13,27,"You also put my feet in the stocks, and mark all my paths. You set a bound to the soles of my feet, 28though I am decaying like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten."
Job,14,2,"He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down. He also flees like a shadow, and doesn’t continue."
Job,14,3,"Do you open your eyes on such a one, and bring me into judgment with you?"
Job,14,4,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.
Job,14,5,"Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his bounds that he can’t pass;"
Job,14,6,"Look away from him, that he may rest, until he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day. 7“For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, that the tender branch of it will not cease."
Job,14,8,"Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stock dies in the ground, 9yet through the scent of water it will bud, and put forth boughs like a plant."
Job,14,10,"But man dies, and is laid low. Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?"
Job,14,11,"As the waters fail from the sea, and the river wastes and dries up, 12so man lies down and doesn’t rise. Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake, nor be roused out of their sleep. 13“Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would keep me secret, until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
Job,14,14,"If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare would I wait, until my release should come."
Job,14,15,"You would call, and I would answer you. You would have a desire to the work of your hands."
Job,14,16,But now you number my steps. Don’t you watch over my sin?
Job,14,17,My disobedience is sealed up in a bag. You fasten up my iniquity. 18“But the mountain falling comes to nothing. The rock is removed out of its place;
Job,14,19,The waters wear the stones. The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth. So you destroy the hope of man.
Job,14,20,"You forever prevail against him, and he departs. You change his face, and send him away."
Job,14,21,"His sons come to honor, and he doesn’t know it. They are brought low, but he doesn’t perceive it of them."
Job,14,22,"But his flesh on him has pain, and his soul within him mourns.”"
Job,15,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, 2“Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge, and fill himself with the east wind?"
Job,15,3,"Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches with which he can do no good?"
Job,15,4,"Yes, you do away with fear, and hinder devotion before God."
Job,15,5,"For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty."
Job,15,6,"Your own mouth condemns you, and not I. Yes, your own lips testify against you. 7“Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought forth before the hills?"
Job,15,8,Have you heard the secret counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
Job,15,9,"What do you know, that we don’t know? What do you understand, which is not in us?"
Job,15,10,"With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, much elder than your father."
Job,15,11,"Are the consolations of God too small for you, even the word that is gentle toward you?"
Job,15,12,"Why does your heart carry you away? Why do your eyes flash,"
Job,15,13,"That you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?"
Job,15,14,"What is man, that he should be clean? What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
Job,15,15,"Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones. Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight; 16how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water! 17“I will show you, listen to me; that which I have seen I will declare: 18(Which wise men have told by their fathers, and have not hidden it; 19to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them): 20the wicked man writhes in pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor."
Job,15,21,A sound of terrors is in his ears. In prosperity the destroyer shall come on him.
Job,15,22,He doesn’t believe that he shall return out of darkness. He is waited for by the sword.
Job,15,23,"He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’ He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand."
Job,15,24,"Distress and anguish make him afraid. They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle."
Job,15,25,"Because he has stretched out his hand against God, and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty; 26he runs at him with a stiff neck, with the thick shields of his bucklers; 27because he has covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat on his thighs."
Job,15,28,"He has lived in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabited, which were ready to become heaps."
Job,15,29,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth."
Job,15,30,He shall not depart out of darkness. The flame shall dry up his branches. By the breath of God’s mouth shall he go away.
Job,15,31,"Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; for emptiness shall be his reward."
Job,15,32,It shall be accomplished before his time. His branch shall not be green.
Job,15,33,"He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree."
Job,15,34,"For the company of the godless shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery."
Job,15,35,"They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. Their heart prepares deceit.”"
Job,16,1,"Then Job answered, 2“I have heard many such things. You are all miserable comforters!"
Job,16,3,Shall vain words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer?
Job,16,4,"I also could speak as you do. If your soul were in my soul’s place, I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you, 5but I would strengthen you with my mouth. The solace of my lips would relieve you. 6“Though I speak, my grief is not subsided. Though I forbear, what am I eased?"
Job,16,7,"But now, God, you have surely worn me out. You have made desolate all my company."
Job,16,8,You have shriveled me up. This is a witness against me. My leanness rises up against me. It testifies to my face.
Job,16,9,"He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me. He has gnashed on me with his teeth. My adversary sharpens his eyes on me."
Job,16,10,They have gaped on me with their mouth. They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully. They gather themselves together against me.
Job,16,11,"God delivers me to the ungodly, and casts me into the hands of the wicked."
Job,16,12,"I was at ease, and he broke me apart. Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces. He has also set me up for his target."
Job,16,13,"His archers surround me. He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare. He pours out my gall on the ground."
Job,16,14,He breaks me with breach on breach. He runs on me like a giant.
Job,16,15,"I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and have thrust my horn in the dust."
Job,16,16,My face is red with weeping. Deep darkness is on my eyelids.
Job,16,17,"Although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure. 18“Earth, don’t cover my blood. Let my cry have no place to rest."
Job,16,19,"Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven. He who vouches for me is on high."
Job,16,20,"My friends scoff at me. My eyes pour out tears to God, 21that he would maintain the right of a man with God, of a son of man with his neighbor!"
Job,16,22,"For when a few years have come, I shall go the way of no return."
Job,17,2,"Surely there are mockers with me. My eye dwells on their provocation. 3“Now give a pledge, be collateral for me with yourself. Who is there who will strike hands with me?"
Job,17,4,"For you have hidden their heart from understanding, Therefore you shall not exalt them."
Job,17,5,"He who denounces his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail. 6“But he has made me a byword of the people. They spit in my face."
Job,17,7,My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow. All my members are as a shadow.
Job,17,8,Upright men shall be astonished at this. The innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.
Job,17,9,Yet shall the righteous hold on his way. He who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger.
Job,17,10,"But as for you all, come on now again; I shall not find a wise man among you."
Job,17,11,"My days are past, my plans are broken off, as are the thoughts of my heart."
Job,17,12,"They change the night into day, saying ‘The light is near’ in the presence of darkness."
Job,17,13,"If I look for Sheol as my house, if I have spread my couch in the darkness,"
Job,17,14,"If I have said to corruption, ‘You are my father;’ to the worm, ‘My mother,’ and ‘my sister;’ 15where then is my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?"
Job,17,16,"Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol, or descend together into the dust?”"
Job,18,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 2“How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak."
Job,18,3,"Why are we counted as animals, which have become unclean in your sight?"
Job,18,4,"You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place? 5“Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, The spark of his fire shall not shine."
Job,18,6,The light shall be dark in his tent. His lamp above him shall be put out.
Job,18,7,The steps of his strength shall be shortened. His own counsel shall cast him down.
Job,18,8,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he wanders into its mesh."
Job,18,9,A snare will take him by the heel. A trap will catch him.
Job,18,10,"A noose is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him in the way."
Job,18,11,"Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall chase him at his heels."
Job,18,12,His strength shall be famished. Calamity shall be ready at his side.
Job,18,13,The members of his body shall be devoured. The firstborn of death shall devour his members.
Job,18,14,He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusts. He shall be brought to the king of terrors.
Job,18,15,There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his. Sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation.
Job,18,16,His roots shall be dried up beneath. Above shall his branch be cut off.
Job,18,17,His memory shall perish from the earth. He shall have no name in the street.
Job,18,18,"He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world."
Job,18,19,"He shall have neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining where he lived."
Job,18,20,"Those who come after shall be astonished at his day, as those who went before were frightened."
Job,18,21,Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous. This is the place of him who doesn’t know God.”
Job,19,1,"Then Job answered, 2“How long will you torment me, and crush me with words?"
Job,19,3,You have reproached me ten times. You aren’t ashamed that you attack me.
Job,19,4,"If it is true that I have erred, my error remains with myself."
Job,19,5,"If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach; 6know now that God has subverted me, and has surrounded me with his net. 7“Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard. I cry for help, but there is no justice."
Job,19,8,"He has walled up my way so that I can’t pass, and has set darkness in my paths."
Job,19,9,"He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head."
Job,19,10,"He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone. My hope he has plucked up like a tree."
Job,19,11,He has also kindled his wrath against me. He counts me among his adversaries.
Job,19,12,"His troops come on together, build a siege ramp against me, and encamp around my tent. 13“He has put my brothers far from me. My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me."
Job,19,14,My relatives have gone away. My familiar friends have forgotten me.
Job,19,15,"Those who dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger. I am an alien in their sight."
Job,19,16,"I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer. I beg him with my mouth."
Job,19,17,My breath is offensive to my wife. I am loathsome to the children of my own mother.
Job,19,18,"Even young children despise me. If I arise, they speak against me."
Job,19,19,All my familiar friends abhor me. They whom I loved have turned against me.
Job,19,20,"My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh. I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. 21“Have pity on me, have pity on me, you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me."
Job,19,22,"Why do you persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? 23“Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!"
Job,19,24,That with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever!
Job,19,25,"But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives. In the end, he will stand upon the earth."
Job,19,26,"After my skin is destroyed, then in my flesh shall I see God,"
Job,19,27,"Whom I, even I, shall see on my side. My eyes shall see, and not as a stranger. “My heart is consumed within me."
Job,19,28,"If you say, ‘How we will persecute him!’ because the root of the matter is found in me, 29be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishments of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment.”"
Job,20,1,"Then Zophar the Naamathite answered, 2“Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, even by reason of my haste that is in me."
Job,20,3,I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame. The spirit of my understanding answers me.
Job,20,4,"Don’t you know this from old time, since man was placed on earth, 5that the triumphing of the wicked is short, the joy of the godless but for a moment?"
Job,20,6,"Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds, 7yet he shall perish forever like his own dung. Those who have seen him shall say, ‘Where is he?’"
Job,20,8,"He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found. Yes, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night."
Job,20,9,"The eye which saw him shall see him no more, neither shall his place any more see him."
Job,20,10,His children shall seek the favor of the poor. His hands shall give back his wealth.
Job,20,11,"His bones are full of his youth, but youth shall lie down with him in the dust. 12“Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue, 13though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth; 14yet his food in his bowels is turned. It is cobra venom within him."
Job,20,15,"He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again. God will cast them out of his belly."
Job,20,16,He shall suck cobra venom. The viper’s tongue shall kill him.
Job,20,17,"He shall not look at the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter."
Job,20,18,"That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not swallow it down. According to the substance that he has gotten, he shall not rejoice."
Job,20,19,"For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor. He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up. 20“Because he knew no quietness within him, he shall not save anything of that in which he delights."
Job,20,21,"There was nothing left that he didn’t devour, therefore his prosperity shall not endure."
Job,20,22,"In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress shall overtake him. The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him."
Job,20,23,"When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him. It will rain on him while he is eating."
Job,20,24,He shall flee from the iron weapon. The bronze arrow shall strike him through.
Job,20,25,"He draws it forth, and it comes out of his body. Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver. Terrors are on him."
Job,20,26,All darkness is laid up for his treasures. An unfanned fire shall devour him. It shall consume that which is left in his tent.
Job,20,27,The heavens shall reveal his iniquity. The earth shall rise up against him.
Job,20,28,The increase of his house shall depart. They shall rush away in the day of his wrath.
Job,20,29,"This is the portion of a wicked man from God, the heritage appointed to him by God.”"
Job,21,1,"Then Job answered, 2“Listen diligently to my speech. Let this be your consolation."
Job,21,3,"Allow me, and I also will speak; After I have spoken, mock on."
Job,21,4,"As for me, is my complaint to man? Why shouldn’t I be impatient?"
Job,21,5,"Look at me, and be astonished. Lay your hand on your mouth."
Job,21,6,"When I remember, I am troubled. Horror takes hold of my flesh. 7“Why do the wicked live, become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?"
Job,21,8,"Their child is established with them in their sight, their offspring before their eyes."
Job,21,9,"Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them."
Job,21,10,"Their bulls breed without fail. Their cows calve, and don’t miscarry."
Job,21,11,They send forth their little ones like a flock. Their children dance.
Job,21,12,"They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe."
Job,21,13,They spend their days in prosperity. In an instant they go down to Sheol.
Job,21,14,"They tell God, ‘Depart from us, for we don’t want to know about your ways."
Job,21,15,"What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What profit should we have, if we pray to him?’"
Job,21,16,"Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand. The counsel of the wicked is far from me. 17“How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out, that their calamity comes on them, that God distributes sorrows in his anger?"
Job,21,18,"How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind, as chaff that the storm carries away?"
Job,21,19,"You say, ‘God lays up his iniquity for his children.’ Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it."
Job,21,20,Let his own eyes see his destruction. Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
Job,21,21,"For what does he care for his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off? 22“Shall any teach God knowledge, since he judges those who are high?"
Job,21,23,"One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet."
Job,21,24,His pails are full of milk. The marrow of his bones is moistened.
Job,21,25,"Another dies in bitterness of soul, and never tastes of good."
Job,21,26,"They lie down alike in the dust. The worm covers them. 27“Behold, I know your thoughts, the devices with which you would wrong me."
Job,21,28,"For you say, ‘Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?’"
Job,21,29,"Haven’t you asked wayfaring men? Don’t you know their evidences, 30that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, That they are led forth to the day of wrath?"
Job,21,31,Who shall declare his way to his face? Who shall repay him what he has done?
Job,21,32,Yet he will be borne to the grave. Men shall keep watch over the tomb.
Job,21,33,"The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him. All men shall draw after him, as there were innumerable before him."
Job,21,34,"So how can you comfort me with nonsense, because in your answers there remains only falsehood?”"
Job,22,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, 2“Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself."
Job,22,3,"Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous? Or does it benefit him, that you make your ways perfect?"
Job,22,4,"Is it for your piety that he reproves you, that he enters with you into judgment?"
Job,22,5,Isn’t your wickedness great? Neither is there any end to your iniquities.
Job,22,6,"For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing."
Job,22,7,"You haven’t given water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry."
Job,22,8,"But as for the mighty man, he had the earth. The honorable man, he lived in it."
Job,22,9,"You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken."
Job,22,10,"Therefore snares are around you. Sudden fear troubles you, 11or darkness, so that you can not see, and floods of waters cover you. 12“Isn’t God in the heights of heaven? See the height of the stars, how high they are!"
Job,22,13,"You say, ‘What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?"
Job,22,14,"Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn’t see. He walks on the vault of the sky.’"
Job,22,15,"Will you keep the old way, which wicked men have trodden, 16who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream, 17who said to God, ‘Depart from us;’ and, ‘What can the Almighty do for us?’"
Job,22,18,"Yet he filled their houses with good things, but the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
Job,22,19,"The righteous see it, and are glad. The innocent ridicule them, 20saying, ‘Surely those who rose up against us are cut off. The fire has consumed their remnant.’ 21“Acquaint yourself with him, now, and be at peace. Thereby good shall come to you."
Job,22,22,"Please receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart."
Job,22,23,"If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up, if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents."
Job,22,24,"Lay your treasure in the dust, the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks."
Job,22,25,"The Almighty will be your treasure, and precious silver to you."
Job,22,26,"For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and shall lift up your face to God."
Job,22,27,"You shall make your prayer to him, and he will hear you. You shall pay your vows."
Job,22,28,"You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to you. Light shall shine on your ways."
Job,22,29,"When they cast down, you shall say, ‘be lifted up.’ He will save the humble person."
Job,22,30,"He will even deliver him who is not innocent. Yes, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”"
Job,23,1,"Then Job answered, 2“Even today my complaint is rebellious. His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning."
Job,23,3,Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!
Job,23,4,"I would set my cause in order before him, and fill my mouth with arguments."
Job,23,5,"I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would tell me."
Job,23,6,"Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No, but he would listen to me."
Job,23,7,"There the upright might reason with him, so I should be delivered forever from my judge. 8“If I go east, he is not there; if west, I can’t find him;"
Job,23,9,"He works to the north, but I can’t see him. He turns south, but I can’t catch a glimpse of him."
Job,23,10,"But he knows the way that I take. When he has tried me, I shall come forth like gold."
Job,23,11,"My foot has held fast to his steps. I have kept his way, and not turned aside."
Job,23,12,I haven’t gone back from the commandment of his lips. I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
Job,23,13,"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? What his soul desires, even that he does."
Job,23,14,For he performs that which is appointed for me. Many such things are with him.
Job,23,15,"Therefore I am terrified at his presence. When I consider, I am afraid of him."
Job,23,16,For God has made my heart faint. The Almighty has terrified me.
Job,23,17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face."
Job,24,2,"There are people who remove the landmarks. They violently take away flocks, and feed them."
Job,24,3,"They drive away the donkey of the fatherless, and they take the widow’s ox for a pledge."
Job,24,4,They turn the needy out of the way. The poor of the earth all hide themselves.
Job,24,5,"Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert, they go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food. The wilderness yields them bread for their children."
Job,24,6,They cut their provender in the field. They glean the vineyard of the wicked.
Job,24,7,"They lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering in the cold."
Job,24,8,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter."
Job,24,9,"There are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor,"
Job,24,10,"So that they go around naked without clothing. Being hungry, they carry the sheaves."
Job,24,11,"They make oil within the walls of these men. They tread wine presses, and suffer thirst."
Job,24,12,"From out of the populous city, men groan. The soul of the wounded cries out, yet God doesn’t regard the folly. 13“These are of those who rebel against the light. They don’t know its ways, nor stay in its paths."
Job,24,14,The murderer rises with the light. He kills the poor and needy. In the night he is like a thief.
Job,24,15,"The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, ‘No eye shall see me.’ He disguises his face."
Job,24,16,In the dark they dig through houses. They shut themselves up in the daytime. They don’t know the light.
Job,24,17,"For the morning is to all of them like thick darkness, for they know the terrors of the thick darkness. 18“They are foam on the surface of the waters. Their portion is cursed in the earth. They don’t turn into the way of the vineyards."
Job,24,19,"Drought and heat consume the snow waters, so does Sheol those who have sinned."
Job,24,20,The womb shall forget him. The worm shall feed sweetly on him. He shall be no more remembered. Unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.
Job,24,21,He devours the barren who don’t bear. He shows no kindness to the widow.
Job,24,22,Yet God preserves the mighty by his power. He rises up who has no assurance of life.
Job,24,23,"God gives them security, and they rest in it. His eyes are on their ways."
Job,24,24,"They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone. Yes, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others, and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain."
Job,24,25,"If it isn’t so now, who will prove me a liar, and make my speech worth nothing?”"
Job,25,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 2“Dominion and fear are with him. He makes peace in his high places."
Job,25,3,Can his armies be counted? On whom does his light not arise?
Job,25,4,How then can man be just with God? Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean?
Job,25,5,"Behold, even the moon has no brightness, and the stars are not pure in his sight;"
Job,25,6,"How much less man, who is a worm, the son of man, who is a worm!”"
Job,26,1,"Then Job answered, 2“How have you helped him who is without power! How have you saved the arm that has no strength!"
Job,26,3,"How have you counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge!"
Job,26,4,"To whom have you uttered words? Whose spirit came forth from you? 5“Those who are deceased tremble, those beneath the waters and all that live in them."
Job,26,6,"Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering."
Job,26,7,"He stretches out the north over empty space, and hangs the earth on nothing."
Job,26,8,"He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not burst under them."
Job,26,9,"He encloses the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud on it."
Job,26,10,"He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters, and to the confines of light and darkness."
Job,26,11,The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke.
Job,26,12,"He stirs up the sea with his power, and by his understanding he strikes through Rahab."
Job,26,13,By his Spirit the heavens are garnished. His hand has pierced the swift serpent.
Job,26,14,"Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways. How small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?”"
Job,27,1,"Job again took up his parable, and said, 2“As God lives, who has taken away my right, the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter. 3(For the length of my life is still in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils); 4surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, neither shall my tongue utter deceit."
Job,27,5,Far be it from me that I should justify you. Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
Job,27,6,"I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go. My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. The Wicked Man’s Portion 7“Let my enemy be as the wicked. Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous."
Job,27,8,"For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?"
Job,27,9,Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?
Job,27,10,"Will he delight himself in the Almighty, and call on God at all times?"
Job,27,11,I will teach you about the hand of God. That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
Job,27,12,"Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain? 13“This is the portion of a wicked man with God, the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty."
Job,27,14,"If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword. His offspring shall not be satisfied with bread."
Job,27,15,Those who remain of him shall be buried in death. His widows shall make no lamentation.
Job,27,16,"Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as the clay; 17he may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver."
Job,27,18,"He builds his house as the moth, as a booth which the watchman makes."
Job,27,19,"He lies down rich, but he shall not do so again. He opens his eyes, and he is not."
Job,27,20,Terrors overtake him like waters. A storm steals him away in the night.
Job,27,21,"The east wind carries him away, and he departs. It sweeps him out of his place."
Job,27,22,"For it hurls at him, and does not spare, as he flees away from his hand."
Job,27,23,"Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place."
Job,28,2,"Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted out of the ore."
Job,28,3,"Man sets an end to darkness, and searches out, to the furthest bound, the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness."
Job,28,4,"He breaks open a shaft away from where people live. They are forgotten by the foot. They hang far from men, they swing back and forth."
Job,28,5,"As for the earth, out of it comes bread; Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire."
Job,28,6,Sapphires come from its rocks. It has dust of gold.
Job,28,7,"That path no bird of prey knows, neither has the falcon’s eye seen it."
Job,28,8,"The proud animals have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion passed by there."
Job,28,9,"He puts forth his hand on the flinty rock, and he overturns the mountains by the roots."
Job,28,10,He cuts out channels among the rocks. His eye sees every precious thing.
Job,28,11,He binds the streams that they don’t trickle. The thing that is hidden he brings forth to light. 12“But where shall wisdom be found? Where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,13,Man doesn’t know its price; Neither is it found in the land of the living.
Job,28,14,"The deep says, ‘It isn’t in me.’ The sea says, ‘It isn’t with me.’"
Job,28,15,"It can’t be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for its price."
Job,28,16,"It can’t be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire."
Job,28,17,"Gold and glass can’t equal it, neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold."
Job,28,18,"No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal. Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies."
Job,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold."
Job,28,20,Where then does wisdom come from? Where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,21,"Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the birds of the sky."
Job,28,22,"Destruction and Death say, ‘We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.’ 23“God understands its way, and he knows its place."
Job,28,24,"For he looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the whole sky."
Job,28,25,"He establishes the force of the wind. Yes, he measures out the waters by measure."
Job,28,26,"When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder; 27then he saw it, and declared it. He established it, yes, and searched it out."
Job,28,28,"To man he said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom. To depart from evil is understanding.’”"
Job,29,1,"Job again took up his parable, and said, 2“Oh that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me; 3when his lamp shone on my head, and by his light I walked through darkness, 4as I was in the ripeness of my days, when the friendship of God was in my tent, 5when the Almighty was yet with me, and my children were around me, 6when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out streams of oil for me, 7when I went forth to the city gate, when I prepared my seat in the street."
Job,29,8,The young men saw me and hid themselves. The aged rose up and stood.
Job,29,9,"The princes refrained from talking, and laid their hand on their mouth."
Job,29,10,"The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth."
Job,29,11,"For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it commended me:"
Job,29,12,"Because I delivered the poor who cried, and the fatherless also, who had none to help him, 13the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy."
Job,29,14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me. My justice was as a robe and a diadem."
Job,29,15,"I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame."
Job,29,16,"I was a father to the needy. The cause of him who I didn’t know, I searched out."
Job,29,17,"I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, and plucked the prey out of his teeth."
Job,29,18,"Then I said, ‘I shall die in my own house, I shall number my days as the sand."
Job,29,19,My root is spread out to the waters. The dew lies all night on my branch.
Job,29,20,"My glory is fresh in me. My bow is renewed in my hand.’ 21“Men listened to me, waited, and kept silence for my counsel."
Job,29,22,After my words they didn’t speak again. My speech fell on them.
Job,29,23,They waited for me as for the rain. Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.
Job,29,24,I smiled on them when they had no confidence. They didn’t reject the light of my face.
Job,29,25,"I chose out their way, and sat as chief. I lived as a king in the army, as one who comforts the mourners."
Job,30,2,"Of what use is the strength of their hands to me, men in whom ripe age has perished?"
Job,30,3,"They are gaunt from lack and famine. They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation."
Job,30,4,They pluck salt herbs by the bushes. The roots of the broom are their food.
Job,30,5,They are driven out from the midst of men. They cry after them as after a thief;
Job,30,6,"So that they dwell in frightful valleys, and in holes of the earth and of the rocks."
Job,30,7,Among the bushes they bray; and under the nettles they are gathered together.
Job,30,8,"They are children of fools, yes, children of base men. They were flogged out of the land. 9“Now I have become their song. Yes, I am a byword to them."
Job,30,10,"They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and don’t hesitate to spit in my face."
Job,30,11,"For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me; and they have thrown off restraint before me."
Job,30,12,"On my right hand rise the rabble. They thrust aside my feet, They cast up against me their ways of destruction."
Job,30,13,"They mar my path, They set forward my calamity, without anyone’s help."
Job,30,14,"As through a wide breach they come, in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves in. Job’s Prosperity Becomes Calamity"
Job,30,15,Terrors have turned on me. They chase my honor as the wind. My welfare has passed away as a cloud. 16“Now my soul is poured out within me. Days of affliction have taken hold on me.
Job,30,17,"In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest."
Job,30,18,By great force is my garment disfigured. It binds me about as the collar of my coat.
Job,30,19,He has cast me into the mire. I have become like dust and ashes.
Job,30,20,"I cry to you, and you do not answer me. I stand up, and you gaze at me."
Job,30,21,You have turned to be cruel to me. With the might of your hand you persecute me.
Job,30,22,"You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it. You dissolve me in the storm."
Job,30,23,"For I know that you will bring me to death, To the house appointed for all living. 24“However doesn’t one stretch out a hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?"
Job,30,25,Didn’t I weep for him who was in trouble? Wasn’t my soul grieved for the needy?
Job,30,26,"When I looked for good, then evil came; When I waited for light, there came darkness."
Job,30,27,"My heart is troubled, and doesn’t rest. Days of affliction have come on me."
Job,30,28,"I go mourning without the sun. I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help."
Job,30,29,"I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches."
Job,30,30,My skin grows black and peels from me. My bones are burned with heat.
Job,30,31,"Therefore my harp has turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of those who weep."
Job,31,2,"For what is the portion from God above, and the heritage from the Almighty on high?"
Job,31,3,"Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity?"
Job,31,4,"Doesn’t he see my ways, and number all my steps? 5“If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot has hurried to deceit 6(let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity); 7if my step has turned out of the way, if my heart walked after my eyes, if any defilement has stuck to my hands, 8then let me sow, and let another eat. Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out. 9“If my heart has been enticed to a woman, and I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door, 10then let my wife grind for another, and let others sleep with her."
Job,31,11,"For that would be a heinous crime. Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges:"
Job,31,12,"For it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would root out all my increase. 13“If I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant, when they contended with me;"
Job,31,14,"What then shall I do when God rises up? When he visits, what shall I answer him?"
Job,31,15,"Didn’t he who made me in the womb make him? Didn’t one fashion us in the womb? 16“If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, 17or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it 18(no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, her have I guided from my mother’s womb); 19if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering; 20if his heart hasn’t blessed me, if he hasn’t been warmed with my sheep’s fleece; 21if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate, 22then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from the bone."
Job,31,23,"For calamity from God is a terror to me. Because his majesty, I can do nothing. 24“If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, ‘You are my confidence;’"
Job,31,25,"If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much; 26if I have seen the sun when it shined, or the moon moving in splendor, 27and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth, 28this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges; for I should have denied the God who is above. 29“If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him; 30(yes, I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse); 31if the men of my tent have not said, ‘Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?’ 32(the foreigner has not lodged in the street, but I have opened my doors to the traveler); 33if like Adam I have covered my transgressions, by hiding my iniquity in my heart, 34because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and didn’t go out of the door— 35oh that I had one to hear me! (behold, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me); let the accuser write my indictment!"
Job,31,36,Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; and I would bind it to me as a crown.
Job,31,37,I would declare to him the number of my steps. as a prince would I go near to him.
Job,31,38,"If my land cries out against me, and its furrows weep together; 39if I have eaten its fruits without money, or have caused its owners to lose their life, 40let briars grow instead of wheat, and stinkweed instead of barley.” The words of Job are ended."
Job,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,"Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His wrath"
Job,32,3,Also his wrath was kindled against his three
Job,32,4,Now Elihu had waited to
Job,32,5,"When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled."
Job,32,6,"Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, “I am young, and you are very old; Therefore I held back, and didn’t dare show you my opinion."
Job,32,7,"I said, ‘Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.’"
Job,32,8,"But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding."
Job,32,9,"It is not the great who are wise, nor the aged who understand justice."
Job,32,10,"Therefore I said, ‘Listen to me; I also will show my opinion.’ 11“Behold, I waited for your words, and I listened for your reasoning, while you searched out what to say."
Job,32,12,"Yes, I gave you my full attention, but there was no one who convinced Job, or who answered his words, among you."
Job,32,13,"Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom, God may refute him, not man;’ 14for he has not directed his words against me; neither will I answer him with your speeches. 15“They are amazed. They answer no more. They don’t have a word to say."
Job,32,16,"Shall I wait, because they don’t speak, because they stand still, and answer no more?"
Job,32,17,"I also will answer my part, and I also will show my opinion."
Job,32,18,For I am full of words. The spirit within me constrains me.
Job,32,19,"Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent; like new wineskins it is ready to burst."
Job,32,20,"I will speak, that I may be refreshed. I will open my lips and answer."
Job,32,21,"Please don’t let me respect any man’s person, neither will I give flattering titles to any man."
Job,32,22,For I don’t know how to give flattering titles; or else my Maker would soon take me away.
Job,33,2,"See now, I have opened my mouth. My tongue has spoken in my mouth."
Job,33,3,My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart. That which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.
Job,33,4,"The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life."
Job,33,5,"If you can, answer me. Set your words in order before me, and stand forth."
Job,33,6,"Behold, I am toward God even as you are. I am also formed out of the clay."
Job,33,7,"Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy on you. 8“Surely you have spoken in my hearing, I have heard the voice of your words, saying, 9‘I am clean, without disobedience. I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me."
Job,33,10,"Behold, he finds occasions against me. He counts me for his enemy."
Job,33,11,"He puts my feet in the stocks. He marks all my paths.’ 12“Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just, for God is greater than man."
Job,33,13,"Why do you strive against him, because he doesn’t give account of any of his matters?"
Job,33,14,"For God speaks once, yes twice, though man pays no attention."
Job,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, in slumbering on the bed;"
Job,33,16,"Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,"
Job,33,17,"That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man."
Job,33,18,"He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword."
Job,33,19,"He is chastened also with pain on his bed, with continual strife in his bones;"
Job,33,20,"So that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty food."
Job,33,21,"His flesh is so consumed away, that it can’t be seen. His bones that were not seen stick out."
Job,33,22,"Yes, his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers. 23“If there is beside him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him; 24then God is gracious to him, and says, ‘Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.’"
Job,33,25,His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s. He returns to the days of his youth.
Job,33,26,"He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees his face with joy. He restores to man his righteousness."
Job,33,27,"He sings before men, and says, ‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it didn’t profit me."
Job,33,28,"He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit. My life shall see the light.’ 29“Behold, God works all these things, twice, yes three times, with a man, 30to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living."
Job,33,31,"Mark well, Job, and listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will speak."
Job,33,32,"If you have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I desire to justify you."
Job,33,33,"If not, listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.”"
Job,34,1,"Moreover Elihu answered, 2“Hear my words, you wise men. Give ear to me, you who have knowledge."
Job,34,3,"For the ear tries words, as the palate tastes food."
Job,34,4,Let us choose for us that which is right. Let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job,34,5,"For Job has said, ‘I am righteous, God has taken away my right:"
Job,34,6,"Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’"
Job,34,7,"What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water,"
Job,34,8,"Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men?"
Job,34,9,"For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.’ 10“Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity."
Job,34,11,"For the work of a man he will render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways."
Job,34,12,"Yes surely, God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice."
Job,34,13,Who put him in charge of the earth? or who has appointed him over the whole world?
Job,34,14,"If he set his heart on himself, If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath, 15all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust. 16“If now you have understanding, hear this. Listen to the voice of my words."
Job,34,17,Shall even one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?—
Job,34,18,"Who says to a king, ‘Vile!’ or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’?"
Job,34,19,"Who doesn’t respect the persons of princes, nor respects the rich more than the poor; for they all are the work of his hands."
Job,34,20,"In a moment they die, even at midnight. The people are shaken and pass away. The mighty are taken away without a hand. 21“For his eyes are on the ways of a man. He sees all his goings."
Job,34,22,"There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
Job,34,23,"For he doesn’t need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment."
Job,34,24,"He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, and sets others in their place."
Job,34,25,"Therefore he takes knowledge of their works. He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed."
Job,34,26,"He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others; 27because they turned aside from following him, and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways, 28so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him. He heard the cry of the afflicted."
Job,34,29,"When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? When he hides his face, who then can see him? Alike whether to a nation, or to a man, 30that the godless man may not reign, that there be no one to ensnare the people. 31“For has any said to God, ‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more."
Job,34,32,"Teach me that which I don’t see. If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?"
Job,34,33,"Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it? For you must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what you know."
Job,34,34,"Men of understanding will tell me, yes, every wise man who hears me: 35‘Job speaks without knowledge. His words are without wisdom.’"
Job,34,36,"I wish that Job were tried to the end, because of his answering like wicked men."
Job,34,37,"For he adds rebellion to his sin. He claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God.”"
Job,35,1,"Moreover Elihu answered, 2“Do you think this to be your right, or do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s,’"
Job,35,3,"That you ask, ‘What advantage will it be to you? What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?’"
Job,35,4,"I will answer you, and your companions with you."
Job,35,5,"Look to the heavens, and see. See the skies, which are higher than you."
Job,35,6,"If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him? If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?"
Job,35,7,"If you are righteous, what do you give him? Or what does he receive from your hand?"
Job,35,8,"Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are, and your righteousness may profit a son of man. 9“By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out. They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty."
Job,35,10,"But none says, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night, 11who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’"
Job,35,12,"There they cry, but none gives answer, because of the pride of evil men."
Job,35,13,"Surely God will not hear an empty cry, neither will the Almighty regard it."
Job,35,14,"How much less when you say you don’t see him. The cause is before him, and you wait for him!"
Job,35,15,"But now, because he has not visited in his anger, neither does he greatly regard arrogance."
Job,35,16,"Therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk, and he multiplies words without knowledge.”"
Job,36,1,"Elihu also continued, and said, 2“Bear with me a little, and I will show you; for I still have something to say on God’s behalf."
Job,36,3,"I will get my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
Job,36,4,"For truly my words are not false. One who is perfect in knowledge is with you. 5“Behold, God is mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone. He is mighty in strength of understanding."
Job,36,6,"He doesn’t preserve the life of the wicked, but gives to the afflicted their right."
Job,36,7,"He doesn’t withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne, he sets them forever, and they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"If they are bound in fetters, and are taken in the cords of afflictions, 9then he shows them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly."
Job,36,10,"He also opens their ears to instruction, and commands that they return from iniquity."
Job,36,11,"If they listen and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures."
Job,36,12,"But if they don’t listen, they shall perish by the sword; they shall die without knowledge. 13“But those who are godless in heart lay up anger. They don’t cry for help when he binds them."
Job,36,14,They die in youth. Their life perishes among the unclean.
Job,36,15,"He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, and opens their ear in oppression."
Job,36,16,"Yes, he would have allured you out of distress, into a broad place, where there is no restriction. That which is set on your table would be full of fatness. 17“But you are full of the judgment of the wicked. Judgment and justice take hold of you."
Job,36,18,"Don’t let riches entice you to wrath, neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside."
Job,36,19,"Would your wealth sustain you in distress, or all the might of your strength?"
Job,36,20,"Don’t desire the night, when people are cut off in their place."
Job,36,21,"Take heed, don’t regard iniquity; for you have chosen this rather than affliction."
Job,36,22,"Behold, God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?"
Job,36,23,"Who has prescribed his way for him? Or who can say, ‘You have committed unrighteousness?’ 24“Remember that you magnify his work, whereof men have sung."
Job,36,25,All men have looked thereon. Man sees it afar off.
Job,36,26,"Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him. The number of his years is unsearchable."
Job,36,27,"For he draws up the drops of water, which distill in rain from his vapor,"
Job,36,28,Which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly.
Job,36,29,"Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds, and the thunderings of his pavilion?"
Job,36,30,"Behold, he spreads his light around him. He covers the bottom of the sea."
Job,36,31,For by these he judges the people. He gives food in abundance.
Job,36,32,"He covers his hands with the lightning, and commands it to strike the mark."

Job,37,2,"Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, the sound that goes out of his mouth."
Job,37,3,"He sends it forth under the whole sky, and his lightning to the ends of the earth."
Job,37,4,After it a voice roars. He thunders with the voice of his majesty. He doesn’t hold back anything when his voice is heard.
Job,37,5,"God thunders marvelously with his voice. He does great things, which we can’t comprehend."
Job,37,6,"For he says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth;’ likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain."
Job,37,7,"He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he has made may know it."
Job,37,8,"Then the animals take cover, and remain in their dens."

Job,37,10,"By the breath of God, ice is given, and the breadth of the waters is frozen."
Job,37,11,"Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture. He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning."
Job,37,12,"It is turned around by his guidance, that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world,"
Job,37,13,"Whether it is for correction, or for his land, or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come. 14“Listen to this, Job. Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God."
Job,37,15,"Do you know how God controls them, and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?"
Job,37,16,"Do you know the workings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?"
Job,37,17,"You whose clothing is warm, when the earth is still by reason of the south wind?"
Job,37,18,"Can you, with him, spread out the sky, which is strong as a cast metal mirror?"
Job,37,19,"Teach us what we shall tell him, for we can’t make our case by reason of darkness."
Job,37,20,Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
Job,37,21,"Now men don’t see the light which is bright in the skies, but the wind passes, and clears them."
Job,37,22,Out of the north comes golden splendor. With God is awesome majesty.
Job,37,23,"We can’t reach the Almighty. He is exalted in power. In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress."
Job,37,24,Therefore men revere him. He doesn’t regard any who are wise of heart.”
Job,38,1,"Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind, 2“Who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?"
Job,38,3,"Brace yourself like a man, for I will question you, then you answer me! 4“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have understanding."
Job,38,5,"Who determined its measures, if you know? Or who stretched the line on it?"
Job,38,6,"Whereupon were its foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone, 7when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 8“Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth from the womb, 9when I made clouds its garment, and wrapped it in thick darkness, 10marked out for it my bound, set bars and doors, 11and said, ‘Here you may come, but no further. Here your proud waves shall be stayed?’ 12“Have you commanded the morning in your days, and caused the dawn to know its place; 13that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and shake the wicked out of it?"
Job,38,14,"It is changed as clay under the seal, and stands forth as a garment."
Job,38,15,"From the wicked, their light is withheld. The high arm is broken. 16“Have you entered into the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?"
Job,38,17,Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
Job,38,18,"Have you comprehended the earth in its breadth? Declare, if you know it all. 19“What is the way to the dwelling of light? As for darkness, where is its place, 20that you should take it to its bound, that you should discern the paths to its house?"
Job,38,21,"Surely you know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great!"
Job,38,22,"Have you entered the treasuries of the snow, or have you seen the treasures of the hail, 23which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?"
Job,38,24,"By what way is the lightning distributed, or the east wind scattered on the earth?"
Job,38,25,"Who has cut a channel for the flood water, or the path for the thunderstorm;"
Job,38,26,"To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; on the wilderness, in which there is no man; 27to satisfy the waste and desolate ground, to cause the tender grass to spring forth?"
Job,38,28,Does the rain have a father? Or who fathers the drops of dew?
Job,38,29,"Out of whose womb came the ice? The gray frost of the sky, who has given birth to it?"
Job,38,30,"The waters become hard like stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen. 31“Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades, or loosen the cords of Orion?"
Job,38,32,Can you lead forth the constellations in their season? Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs?
Job,38,33,"Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you establish its dominion over the earth? 34“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, That abundance of waters may cover you?"
Job,38,35,"Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go? Do they report to you, ‘Here we are?’"
Job,38,36,Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who has given understanding to the mind?
Job,38,37,"Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of the sky, 38when the dust runs into a mass, and the clods of earth stick together? 39“Can you hunt the prey for the lioness, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, 40when they crouch in their dens, and lie in wait in the thicket?"
Job,38,41,"Who provides for the raven his prey, when his young ones cry to God, and wander for lack of food?"
Job,39,2,Can you number the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they give birth?
Job,39,3,"They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, they end their labor pains."
Job,39,4,"Their young ones become strong. They grow up in the open field. They go forth, and don’t return again. 5“Who has set the wild donkey free? Or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey,"
Job,39,6,"Whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place?"
Job,39,7,"He scorns the tumult of the city, neither does he hear the shouting of the driver."
Job,39,8,"The range of the mountains is his pasture, He searches after every green thing. 9“Will the wild ox be content to serve you? Or will he stay by your feeding trough?"
Job,39,10,Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness? Or will he till the valleys after you?
Job,39,11,"Will you trust him, because his strength is great? Or will you leave to him your labor?"
Job,39,12,"Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed, and gather the grain of your threshing floor? 13“The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; but are they the feathers and plumage of love?"
Job,39,14,"For she leaves her eggs on the earth, warms them in the dust, 15and forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild animal may trample them."
Job,39,16,"She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers. Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear, 17because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted to her understanding."
Job,39,18,"When she lifts up herself on high, she scorns the horse and his rider. 19“Have you given the horse might? Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane?"
Job,39,20,Have you made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is awesome.
Job,39,21,"He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength. He goes out to meet the armed men."
Job,39,22,"He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed, neither does he turn back from the sword."
Job,39,23,"The quiver rattles against him, the flashing spear and the javelin."
Job,39,24,"He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage, neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet."
Job,39,25,"As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, ‘Aha!’ He smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 26“Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and stretches her wings toward the south?"
Job,39,27,"Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up, and makes his nest on high?"
Job,39,28,"On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home, on the point of the cliff, and the stronghold."
Job,39,29,From there he spies out the prey. His eyes see it afar off.
Job,39,30,"His young ones also suck up blood. Where the slain are, there he is.”"
Job,40,1,"Moreover Yahweh answered Job, 2“Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it.”"
Job,40,3,"Then Job answered Yahweh, 4“Behold, I am of small account. What shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth."
Job,40,5,"I have spoken once, and I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.” The LORD Challenges Job Again"
Job,40,6,"Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind, 7“Now brace yourself like a man. I will question you, and you will answer me."
Job,40,8,"Will you even annul my judgment? Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?"
Job,40,9,Or do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like him? 10“Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity. Array yourself with honor and majesty.
Job,40,11,"Pour out the fury of your anger. Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low."
Job,40,12,"Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him. Crush the wicked in their place."
Job,40,13,Hide them in the dust together. Bind their faces in the hidden place.
Job,40,14,"Then I will also admit to you that your own right hand can save you. 15“See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you. He eats grass as an ox."
Job,40,16,"Look now, his strength is in his thighs. His force is in the muscles of his belly."
Job,40,17,He moves his tail like a cedar. The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
Job,40,18,His bones are like tubes of brass. His limbs are like bars of iron.
Job,40,19,He is the chief of the ways of God. He who made him gives him his sword.
Job,40,20,"Surely the mountains produce food for him, where all the animals of the field play."
Job,40,21,"He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the marsh."
Job,40,22,The lotuses cover him with their shade. The willows of the brook surround him.
Job,40,23,"Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble. He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth."
Job,40,24,"Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?"
Job,41,2,"Can you put a rope into his nose, or pierce his jaw through with a hook?"
Job,41,3,"Will he make many petitions to you, or will he speak soft words to you?"
Job,41,4,"Will he make a covenant with you, that you should take him for a servant forever?"
Job,41,5,Will you play with him as with a bird? Or will you bind him for your girls?
Job,41,6,Will traders barter for him? Will they part him among the merchants?
Job,41,7,"Can you fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish spears?"
Job,41,8,"Lay your hand on him. Remember the battle, and do so no more."
Job,41,9,"Behold, the hope of him is in vain. Won’t one be cast down even at the sight of him?"
Job,41,10,None is so fierce that he dare stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me?
Job,41,11,"Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Everything under the heavens is mine. 12“I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame."
Job,41,13,Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws?
Job,41,14,Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror.
Job,41,15,"Strong scales are his pride, shut up together with a close seal."
Job,41,16,"One is so near to another, that no air can come between them."
Job,41,17,"They are joined one to another. They stick together, so that they can’t be pulled apart."
Job,41,18,His sneezing flashes out light. His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
Job,41,19,Out of his mouth go burning torches. Sparks of fire leap forth.
Job,41,20,"Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds."
Job,41,21,His breath kindles coals. A flame goes forth from his mouth.
Job,41,22,There is strength in his neck. Terror dances before him.
Job,41,23,The flakes of his flesh are joined together. They are firm on him. They can’t be moved.
Job,41,24,"His heart is as firm as a stone, yes, firm as the lower millstone."
Job,41,25,"When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid. They retreat before his thrashing."
Job,41,26,"If one attacks him with the sword, it can’t prevail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft."
Job,41,27,He counts iron as straw; and brass as rotten wood.
Job,41,28,The arrow can’t make him flee. Sling stones are like chaff to him.
Job,41,29,Clubs are counted as stubble. He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.
Job,41,30,"His undersides are like sharp potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge."
Job,41,31,He makes the deep to boil like a pot. He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.

Job,41,33,"On earth there is not his equal, that is made without fear."
Job,41,34,He sees everything that is high. He is king over all the sons of pride.”
Job,42,1,"Then Job answered Yahweh, 2“I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be restrained."

Ecclesiastes,2,11,"Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked, and at the labor that I had labored to do; and behold, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no profit under the sun. The Wise and the Foolish"
Ecclesiastes,2,12,"I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly: for what can the king’s successor do? Just"
Ecclesiastes,2,13,"Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels"
Ecclesiastes,2,14,"The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness—and yet I perceived"
Ecclesiastes,2,15,"Then I said in my heart, “As it happens to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?” Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,2,16,"For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory for ever, since in the days to come all"
Ecclesiastes,2,17,"So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind. The Futility of Work"
Ecclesiastes,2,18,"I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who comes"
Ecclesiastes,2,19,"Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,2,20,Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under
Ecclesiastes,2,21,"For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with skillfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil."
Ecclesiastes,2,22,"For what has a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, in which he labors under the"
Ecclesiastes,2,23,"For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,2,24,"There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good"
Ecclesiastes,2,25,"For who can eat, or who can have"
Ecclesiastes,2,26,"For to the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind."
Ecclesiastes,3,1,"For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven: 2a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; 3a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; 4a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; 5a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; 6a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; 7a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; 8a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace. God’s Works Remain Forever"
Ecclesiastes,3,9,What profit has he who works in that in which he labors?
Ecclesiastes,3,10,I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.
Ecclesiastes,3,11,"He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in their hearts, yet so that man can’t find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end."
Ecclesiastes,3,12,"I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice, and to do good as long as they live."
Ecclesiastes,3,13,"Also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God."
Ecclesiastes,3,14,"I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it;"
Ecclesiastes,3,15,"That which is has been long ago, and that which is to be has been long ago: and God seeks again that which is passed away. From Dust to Dust"
Ecclesiastes,3,16,"Moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place"
Ecclesiastes,3,17,"I said in my heart, “God will judge the righteous and"
Ecclesiastes,3,18,"I said in my heart, “As"
Ecclesiastes,3,19,"For that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals. Even one thing happens to them. As the one dies, so the other dies. Yes, they have all one breath; and man has no advantage over the animals:"
Ecclesiastes,3,20,"All go to one place. All are from the dust, and all turn to dust again."
Ecclesiastes,3,21,"Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, whether it goes downward to"
Ecclesiastes,3,22,"Therefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who can bring him to see what will be after him?"
Ecclesiastes,4,1,"Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of those who were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was"
Ecclesiastes,4,2,Therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than
Ecclesiastes,4,3,"Yes, better than them both is him who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,4,4,Then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a man’s neighbor. This also is vanity and
Ecclesiastes,4,5,The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself.
Ecclesiastes,4,6,"Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and chasing after wind."
Ecclesiastes,4,7,Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,4,8,"There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. “For whom then, do I labor, and deprive my soul of enjoyment?” This also is vanity. Yes, it is a miserable business."
Ecclesiastes,4,9,"Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor."
Ecclesiastes,4,10,"For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn’t have another to lift him"
Ecclesiastes,4,11,"Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?"
Ecclesiastes,4,12,"If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. The Futility of Power"
Ecclesiastes,4,13,Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn’t know how to receive
Ecclesiastes,4,14,"For out of prison he came forth to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was"
Ecclesiastes,4,15,"I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other,"
Ecclesiastes,4,16,"There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was—yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind."

Ecclesiastes,5,2,"Don’t be rash with your mouth, and don’t let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and you on earth. Therefore"
Ecclesiastes,5,3,"For as a dream comes with a multitude of cares, so a fool’s speech with a multitude of words."
Ecclesiastes,5,4,"When you vow a vow to God, don’t defer to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which"
Ecclesiastes,5,5,"It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay."
Ecclesiastes,5,6,Don’t allow your mouth to lead you into sin. Don’t protest before the messenger that this was a mistake. Why

Ecclesiastes,5,11,"When goods increase, those who eat them are increased; and what advantage is there"
Ecclesiastes,5,12,"The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep."
Ecclesiastes,5,13,There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his harm.
Ecclesiastes,5,14,"Those riches perish by misfortune, and if he has fathered a son, there is nothing in his hand."
Ecclesiastes,5,15,"As he came forth from his mother’s womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing"

Ecclesiastes,5,19,"Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him"
Ecclesiastes,5,20,For he shall not often reflect on the days of his life; because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.

Ecclesiastes,6,3,"If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial; I say, that a stillborn child is better than he: 4for it comes"
Ecclesiastes,6,5,Moreover it has not seen

Ecclesiastes,6,9,Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
Ecclesiastes,6,10,"Whatever has been, its name was given long ago; and it is known what man is; neither can he"
Ecclesiastes,6,11,For there are many words that create vanity. What does
Ecclesiastes,6,12,"For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends like a shadow? For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?"
Ecclesiastes,7,1,A good name is better than fine perfume; and the day of death better than the day of one’s birth.
Ecclesiastes,7,2,"It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men, and the living should take this to heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,3,Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made good.
Ecclesiastes,7,4,The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
Ecclesiastes,7,5,"It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools."
Ecclesiastes,7,6,"For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,7,7,Surely extortion makes the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroys the understanding.

Ecclesiastes,7,26,"I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and traps, whose hands are chains. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner will be ensnared by her. 27“Behold, I have found this,” says the Preacher, “one to another, to find out the scheme; 28which my soul still seeks; but I have not found. One man among a thousand have I found; but I have not found"

Ecclesiastes,8,8,There is no man who has power over the spirit to contain the spirit; neither does he have power over the day of death.
Ecclesiastes,8,9,"All this have I seen, and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt. Fear God (Isaiah 8:11–15)"

Ecclesiastes,8,15,"Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,8,16,"When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes), 17then I saw all the work of God, that man can’t find out the work that is done under the sun, because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he won’t find it. Yes even though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it, he won’t be able to find it."
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hatred, man doesn’t know it; all is before them."
Ecclesiastes,9,2,"All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean, to him who sacrifices, and to him who doesn’t sacrifice. As is the good, so is the"

Ecclesiastes,9,12,"For man also doesn’t know his time. As the fish that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them. Wisdom Is Better than Strength"
Ecclesiastes,9,13,"I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way, and it seemed great to me."
Ecclesiastes,9,14,"There was a little city, and few men within it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great bulwarks"

Ecclesiastes,11,6,"In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening don’t withhold your hand; for you don’t know which will prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both will be equally good. Enjoy Your Years"

Ecclesiastes,12,2,"Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain; 3in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those who look out of the windows are darkened, 4and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low; 5yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way; and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets: 6before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the spring, or the wheel broken at the cistern, 7and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it. 8“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher. “All is vanity!” The Whole Duty of Man"

Jeremiah,23,38,"But if you say, The burden of Yahweh; therefore thus says Yahweh: Because you say this word, The burden of Yahweh, and I have sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The burden of Yahweh; 39therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from my presence: 40and I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten."
Jeremiah,24,1,"Yahweh showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Yahweh, after that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to"
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very"
Jeremiah,24,3,"Then Yahweh said to me, What do you see, Jeremiah? I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that can’t be eaten, they are so bad."
Jeremiah,24,4,"The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,"
Jeremiah,24,5,"Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans,"
Jeremiah,24,6,"For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will"
Jeremiah,24,7,"I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return to me with their whole heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"As the bad figs, which can’t be eaten, they are so bad, surely thus says Yahweh, So will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, who remain in this land,"
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places"
Jeremiah,24,10,"I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, until they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers."
Jeremiah,25,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), 2which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,"
Jeremiah,25,3,"From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years, the word of Yahweh has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising up early"
Jeremiah,25,4,"Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them (but you have not listened, nor inclined your ear to hear) 5saying, Return now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers, from of old and even forevermore; 6and don’t go after other gods to serve them or worship them, and don’t provoke me to anger with the work of your hands; and I will"
Jeremiah,25,7,"Yet you have not listened to me, says Yahweh; that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt."
Jeremiah,25,8,"Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies: Because you have not heard my words, 9behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, says Yahweh, and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations around; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing,"
Jeremiah,25,10,"Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the"

Jeremiah,25,12,"It shall happen, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, says Yahweh, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it desolate"
Jeremiah,25,13,"I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is"

Jeremiah,25,17,"Then took I the cup at Yahweh’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom Yahweh had sent"

Jeremiah,25,27,"You shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Drink, and be drunk, vomit, fall,"
Jeremiah,25,28,"It shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then you shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies: You shall"
Jeremiah,25,29,"For, behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should you be utterly unpunished? You shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, says Yahweh of Armies."
Jeremiah,25,30,"Therefore prophesy you against them all these words, and tell them, Yahweh will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he will mightily roar against his fold; he will give a shout, as those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth."

Jeremiah,25,33,"The slain of Yahweh shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung on the surface of the ground. The Cry of the Shepherds"
Jeremiah,25,34,"Wail, you shepherds, and cry; and wallow in dust, you principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come, and you shall fall like a goodly vessel."
Jeremiah,25,35,"The shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape."
Jeremiah,25,36,"A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal of the flock! for Yahweh lays waste their pasture."
Jeremiah,25,37,The peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.
Jeremiah,25,38,"He has left his covert, as the lion; for their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppression, and because of his fierce anger."
Jeremiah,26,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from"
Jeremiah,26,2,"Thus says Yahweh: Stand in the court of Yahweh’s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in Yahweh’s house, all the words that I command you to speak to"
Jeremiah,26,3,"It may be they will listen, and turn every man from his evil way; that I"
Jeremiah,26,4,"You shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you, 5to listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you, even rising up early and sending them, but you have not listened; 6then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth. Jeremiah Threatened with Death"
Jeremiah,26,7,The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of
Jeremiah,26,8,"It happened, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him,"
Jeremiah,26,9,"Why have you prophesied in the name of Yahweh, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant? All the people were gathered to Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh."
Jeremiah,26,10,"When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of"
Jeremiah,26,11,"Then spoke the priests and the prophets to the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy of death; for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears."
Jeremiah,26,12,"Then spoke Jeremiah to all the princes and to all the people, saying, Yahweh sent me to prophesy"
Jeremiah,26,13,"Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of Yahweh your God; and Yahweh will repent him of"
Jeremiah,26,14,"But as for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me"
Jeremiah,26,15,"Only know for certain that, if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city, and on its inhabitants; for of a truth Yahweh has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears. Jeremiah Spared from Death"
Jeremiah,26,16,Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets: This man is not worthy
Jeremiah,26,17,"Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,26,18,"Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest."
Jeremiah,26,19,"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Didn’t he fear Yahweh, and entreat the favor of Yahweh, and Yahweh relented of the disaster which he had pronounced against them? Thus should we commit great evil against our own souls. The Prophet Uriah"
Jeremiah,26,20,"There was also a man who prophesied in the name of Yahweh, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah: 21and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt: 22and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt; 23and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people."
Jeremiah,26,24,"But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death."
Jeremiah,27,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word to Jeremiah"
Jeremiah,27,2,"Thus says Yahweh to me: Make bonds and bars, and put them on your neck; 3and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah; 4and give them a command to their masters, saying, Thus"
Jeremiah,27,5,"I have made the earth, the men and the animals that are on the surface of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched"
Jeremiah,27,6,"Now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the animals of the field also have I given him to"
Jeremiah,27,7,"All the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land come: and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondservant."
Jeremiah,27,8,"It shall happen, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, says Yahweh, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have"
Jeremiah,27,9,"But as for you, don’t you listen to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon: 10for they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land,"
Jeremiah,27,11,"But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that nation will I let remain in their own land, says Yahweh; and they shall till it, and dwell therein."

Jeremiah,27,14,Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who speak
Jeremiah,27,15,"For I have not sent them, says Yahweh, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you, and the prophets who prophesy to you."
Jeremiah,27,16,"Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus says Yahweh: Don’t listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Yahweh’s house shall now shortly"
Jeremiah,27,17,Don’t listen to them; serve the king

Jeremiah,27,19,"For thus says Yahweh of Armies concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city, 20which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn’t take, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 21yes, thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of"
Jeremiah,27,22,"They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, says Yahweh; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place."
Jeremiah,28,1,"It happened the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me"
Jeremiah,28,2,Thus speaks
Jeremiah,28,3,"Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon: 4and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon, says Yahweh; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,5,"Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Yahweh, 6even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: Yahweh do so; Yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of"
Jeremiah,28,7,Nevertheless hear you now
Jeremiah,28,8,"The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of"
Jeremiah,28,9,"The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall happen, then shall the prophet be known, that Yahweh has truly sent him."
Jeremiah,28,10,"Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it."
Jeremiah,28,11,"Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus says Yahweh: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. The prophet Jeremiah went his way."
Jeremiah,28,12,"Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar"
Jeremiah,28,13,"Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says Yahweh:"
Jeremiah,28,14,"For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the"
Jeremiah,28,15,"Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now,"
Jeremiah,28,16,"Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will send you away from off the surface of the earth: this year you shall die, because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh."
Jeremiah,28,17,So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah,29,1,"Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon, 2(after that Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem), 3by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), saying,"
Jeremiah,29,4,"Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, to all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried"
Jeremiah,29,5,"Build houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and"

Jeremiah,29,9,"For they prophesy falsely to you in my name: I have not sent them, says Yahweh."
Jeremiah,29,10,"For thus says Yahweh, After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform"
Jeremiah,29,11,"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says Yahweh, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope and a future."
Jeremiah,29,12,"You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you."
Jeremiah,29,13,"You shall seek me,"
Jeremiah,29,14,"I will be found by you, says Yahweh, and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says Yahweh; and I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive."
Jeremiah,29,15,"Because you have said, Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon; 16thus says Yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who haven’t gone forth with you into captivity; 17thus says Yahweh of Armies; Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile"
Jeremiah,29,18,"I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of horror, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them; 19because they have not listened to my words, says Yahweh, with which I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would"
Jeremiah,29,20,"Hear therefore the word of Yahweh, all you of the captivity, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,21,"Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he shall kill them before your eyes; 22and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; 23because they have worked folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I didn’t command them; and I am he who knows, and am witness, says Yahweh. The Message to Shemaiah"
Jeremiah,29,24,"Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,"

Jeremiah,29,27,"Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you, 28because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long: build houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat their fruit?"
Jeremiah,29,29,Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,29,30,Then came the word of
Jeremiah,29,31,"Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I didn’t send him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie; 32therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he see the good that I will do to my people, says Yahweh, because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh."
Jeremiah,30,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,"
Jeremiah,30,2,"Thus speaks Yahweh, the God of Israel,"
Jeremiah,30,3,"For, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says Yahweh; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it."
Jeremiah,30,4,These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
Jeremiah,30,5,"For thus says Yahweh: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,"Ask now, and see whether a man does travail with child: why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?"
Jeremiah,30,7,"Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it."
Jeremiah,30,8,"It shall come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondservant; 9but they shall serve Yahweh their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them."
Jeremiah,30,10,"Therefore don’t you be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid."
Jeremiah,30,11,"For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished."
Jeremiah,30,12,"For thus says Yahweh, Your hurt is incurable, and your wound grievous."
Jeremiah,30,13,"There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines."
Jeremiah,30,14,"All your lovers have forgotten you; they don’t seek you: for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased."
Jeremiah,30,15,"Why do you cry for your hurt? Your pain is incurable: for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you."
Jeremiah,30,16,"Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, everyone of them, shall go into captivity; and those who despoil you shall be a spoil, and all who prey on you will I give for a prey."
Jeremiah,30,17,"For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says Yahweh; because they have called you an outcast, saying, It is Zion, whom no man seeks after."

Jeremiah,31,8,"Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, along with the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her who travails with child together: a great company shall they return here."
Jeremiah,31,9,"They shall come with weeping; and with petitions will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way in which they shall not stumble; for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn."
Jeremiah,31,10,"Hear the word of Yahweh, you nations, and declare it in the islands afar off; and say, He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as shepherd does his flock."

Jeremiah,38,9,"My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city."
Jeremiah,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from here thirty men with you,"
Jeremiah,38,11,"So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took there rags and worn-out"
Jeremiah,38,12,"Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords. Jeremiah"
Jeremiah,38,13,"So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard."
Jeremiah,38,14,"Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me."
Jeremiah,38,15,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? and if I"
Jeremiah,38,16,"So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life."

Jeremiah,38,21,"But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me: 22behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say, Your familiar friends have set you on, and have prevailed over you. Your feet are sunk in the mire, they have turned away back."
Jeremiah,38,23,"They shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans; and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire."
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die."
Jeremiah,38,25,"But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don’t hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said to you: 26then you shall tell them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not"
Jeremiah,38,27,"Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left"
Jeremiah,38,28,So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
Jeremiah,39,1,"It happened when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it; 2in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city), 3that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the princes"
Jeremiah,39,4,"It happened that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden,"
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath;"

Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon; 14they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he lived among the people."
Jeremiah,39,15,"Now the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,16,"Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished"
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will deliver you in that day, says Yahweh; and you shall not be given"

The Plot against Gedaliah"
Jeremiah,40,13,"Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, 14and said to him, Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn’t believe"
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing; for you speak falsely of Ishmael."

Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near, 2and said to Jeremiah the prophet, Please let our supplication be presented before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your God, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes do see us: 3that Yahweh your God may"

Daniel,1,6,"Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah."
Daniel,1,7,"The prince of the eunuchs gave names to them: to Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego. Daniel’s Faithfulness"

Daniel,2,4,"Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live forever: tell your servants"
Daniel,2,5,"The king answered the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if you don’t make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces,"
Daniel,2,6,"But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and its interpretation."
Daniel,2,7,"They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show"
Daniel,2,8,"The king answered, I know of a certainty that you would gain time, because you"
Daniel,2,9,"But if you don’t make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until the time be changed:"
Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man on the earth who can show the king’s matter, because no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean."
Daniel,2,11,"It is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other who can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."

Daniel,2,16,"Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 18that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,19,Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel,2,20,"Daniel answered, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever; for wisdom and might are his."
Daniel,2,21,"He changes the times and the seasons; he removes kings, and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those who have understanding; 22he reveals the deep and secret things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him."
Daniel,2,23,"I thank you, and praise you, you God of my fathers, who have given me wisdom and might, and have now made known to me what we desired of you; for you have made known to us the king’s matter. Daniel Interprets the Dream"
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him: Don’t destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him, I have found a man of"
Daniel,2,26,"The king answered Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show to the king; 28but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these: 29as for you, O king, your thoughts came into your mind on your bed, what should"
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart."
Daniel,2,31,"You, O king, saw, and behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness"
Daniel,2,32,"As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, 33its legs of iron, its feet part of"
Daniel,2,34,"You saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on"
Daniel,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king.
Daniel,2,37,"You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory; 38and wherever the children of men dwell, the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand, and has made you to rule over them all: you are the head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"After you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth."
Daniel,2,40,"The fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things;"
Daniel,2,41,"Whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the"
Daniel,2,42,As the toes of the feet were
Daniel,2,43,"Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cling to one another, even as iron does not mingle with clay."
Daniel,2,44,"In the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall its sovereignty be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these"
Daniel,2,45,"Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what shall happen hereafter: and the dream is certain, and its interpretation sure. Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel"
Daniel,2,46,"Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they"
Daniel,2,47,"The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you have been"
Daniel,2,48,"Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men"
Daniel,2,49,"Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king."
Daniel,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, and its breadth six"
Daniel,3,2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image"
Daniel,3,3,"Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood"
Daniel,3,4,"Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, peoples, nations, and languages, 5that whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up; 6and whoever doesn’t fall down and worship shall the same hour"
Daniel,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Accused"
Daniel,3,8,"Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews."
Daniel,3,9,They
Daniel,3,10,"You, O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image; 11and whoever doesn’t fall down and worship shall be"
Daniel,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not respected you. They don’t serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up."
Daniel,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego."
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar answered them, Is it on purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don’t serve my god, nor worship the golden image which"
Daniel,3,15,"Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made, well: but if you don’t worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer"
Daniel,3,17,"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery"
Daniel,3,18,"But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up. The Fiery Furnace"
Daniel,3,19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the"
Daniel,3,20,"He commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their pants, their tunics, and their mantles, and their other garments,"
Daniel,3,22,"Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who"
Daniel,3,23,"These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spoke and said to his counselors, Didn’t we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered the king, True,"
Daniel,3,25,"He answered, Look, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are"
Daniel,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego"
Daniel,3,27,"The satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their pants changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them."
Daniel,3,28,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything evil against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be"
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,4,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth: Peace"
Daniel,4,2,It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked toward me.
Daniel,4,3,"How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation. Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream of a Great Tree"
Daniel,4,4,"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace."
Daniel,4,5,I saw a dream which

Daniel,4,8,"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him,"
Daniel,4,9,"Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation."
Daniel,4,10,"Thus were the visions of my head on my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and its height was great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached to the sky, and its sight to the end of all the earth."
Daniel,4,12,"The leaves of it were beautiful, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all: the animals of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the sky lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it."
Daniel,4,13,"I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky."
Daniel,4,14,"He cried aloud, and said thus, Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the animals get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches."
Daniel,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky: and let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth: 16let his heart be changed from man’s, and let an animal’s heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him."
Daniel,4,17,"The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will, and sets up over it the lowest of men."
Daniel,4,18,"This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and you, Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in you. Daniel Interprets the Second Dream"
Daniel,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for a while, and his thoughts troubled him.

Daniel,4,33,"The same hour was the thing fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky, until his hair was grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws. Nebuchadnezzar Restored"
Daniel,4,34,"At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him who lives forever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,35,"All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or ask him, What are you doing?"
Daniel,4,36,"At the same time my understanding returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned to me; and my counselors and my lords sought to me; and I was established"
Daniel,4,37,"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase."
Daniel,5,1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand."

Daniel,5,17,"Then Daniel answered before the king, Let your gifts be to yourself, and give your rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation."
Daniel,5,18,"You, king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty: 19and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he killed, and whom he would he kept"
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: 21and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the animals’, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky; until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of"
Daniel,5,22,"You, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this, 23but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines, have drunk wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which don’t see, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand your breath"
Daniel,5,24,"Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed."
Daniel,5,25,"This is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN."
Daniel,5,26,This is the interpretation
Daniel,5,27,TEKEL; you are
Daniel,5,28,"PERES; your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians."
Daniel,5,29,"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.
Daniel,5,31,"Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old."
Daniel,6,1,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom; 2and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might"
Daniel,6,3,"Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to"
Daniel,6,4,"Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault, because he was faithful,"
Daniel,6,5,"Then these men said, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God."
Daniel,6,6,"Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus to him, King Darius,"
Daniel,6,7,"All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counselors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, he shall be cast"
Daniel,6,8,"Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it not be changed,"
Daniel,6,9,Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree. Daniel in the Lions’ Den

Daniel,6,11,"Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel"
Daniel,6,12,"Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree: Haven’t you signed an decree, that every man who shall make petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t alter."
Daniel,6,13,"Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, doesn’t respect you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day."
Daniel,6,14,"Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to"
Daniel,6,15,"Then these men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed."
Daniel,6,16,"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the"
Daniel,6,17,"A stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with"
Daniel,6,18,"Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him."
Daniel,6,19,"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions."
Daniel,6,20,"When he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spoke and said to Daniel, Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from"
Daniel,6,21,"Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever."
Daniel,6,22,"My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me; because as before him innocence was found in me;"
Daniel,6,23,"Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"The king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions mauled them, and broke all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den. Darius Honors God"
Daniel,6,25,"Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you."
Daniel,6,26,"I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and steadfast forever, His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even to the end."
Daniel,6,27,"He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions."
Daniel,6,28,"So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian."
Daniel,7,1,In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed:
Daniel,7,2,"Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision"
Daniel,7,3,Four great animals came
Daniel,7,4,"The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I saw until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand on two feet as a man;"
Daniel,7,5,"Behold, another animal, a second, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour"
Daniel,7,6,"After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of"
Daniel,7,7,"After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, a fourth animal, awesome and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse"
Daniel,7,8,"I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. Daniel’s Vision of the Ancient of Days"
Daniel,7,9,"I saw until thrones were placed, and one who was ancient of days sat: his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and its wheels burning fire."
Daniel,7,10,"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."
Daniel,7,11,I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke; I saw even until
Daniel,7,12,"As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. Daniel’s Vision of the Son of Man"
Daniel,7,13,"I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him."
Daniel,7,14,"There was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. Daniel’s Visions Interpreted"
Daniel,7,15,"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled"
Daniel,7,16,"I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he"
Daniel,7,17,"These great animals, which are four,"
Daniel,7,18,"But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever."
Daniel,7,19,"Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal, which was diverse from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; 20and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth"
Daniel,7,21,"I saw, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; 22until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"Thus he said, The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all"
Daniel,7,24,"As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he"
Daniel,7,25,"He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times"
Daniel,7,26,"But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end."
Daniel,7,27,"The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole sky, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him."
Daniel,7,28,"Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my face was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart."
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after"
Daniel,8,2,"I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river"
Daniel,8,3,"Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up"
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no animals could stand before him, neither was there any who could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself."
Daniel,8,5,"As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth,"
Daniel,8,6,"He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power."
Daniel,8,7,"I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him; and there was none who could deliver the ram out of his hand."
Daniel,8,8,"The male goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of the sky."
Daniel,8,9,"Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceeding great, toward the south, and"
Daniel,8,10,"It grew great, even to the army of the sky; and some"
Daniel,8,11,"Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the army; and it took away from him the continual burnt offering, and the"

Daniel,8,15,"It happened, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and behold,"
Daniel,8,16,I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the
Daniel,8,17,"So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, son of man; for the vision belongs to the time of the end."
Daniel,8,18,"Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he"
Daniel,8,19,"He said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end."
Daniel,8,20,"The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia."
Daniel,8,21,The rough male goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first
Daniel,8,22,"As for that which was broken, in the place where four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power."
Daniel,8,23,"In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king of fierce face, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up."
Daniel,8,24,"His power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do his pleasure; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people."
Daniel,8,25,"Through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in their security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand."
Daniel,8,26,The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true: but seal up the vision; for it belongs to many days to come.
Daniel,8,27,"I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king’s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it."
Daniel,9,1,"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans, 2in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years about which the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of"
Daniel,9,3,"I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer"
Daniel,9,4,"I prayed to Yahweh my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments, 5we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances; 6neither have we listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land."
Daniel,9,7,"Lord, righteousness belongs to you, but to us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near, and who are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against"

Daniel,9,14,"Therefore has Yahweh watched over the evil, and brought it on us; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his works which he does, and we have not obeyed his voice."
Daniel,9,15,"Now, Lord our God, who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand,"
Daniel,9,16,"Lord, according to all your righteousness, let your anger and please let your wrath be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem"

Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision."
Daniel,10,2,"In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks."
Daniel,10,3,"I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled."

Daniel,10,17,"For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me."
Daniel,10,18,"Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me."
Daniel,10,19,"He said, “Greatly beloved man, don’t be afraid: peace be to you, be strong, yes, be strong.” When he spoke to"

Hosea,1,1,"The word of Yahweh that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel."
Hosea,1,2,"When Yahweh spoke at first by Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, “Go, take for yourself a wife of prostitution and children of unfaithfulness; for the land commits great adultery, forsaking Yahweh.”"
Hosea,1,3,"So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son."
Hosea,1,4,"Yahweh said to him, “Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the"
Hosea,1,5,It will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.”
Hosea,1,6,"She conceived again, and bore a daughter. Then he said to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah; for I"
Hosea,1,7,"But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by Yahweh their God, and will not save them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.”"
Hosea,1,8,"Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son."
Hosea,1,9,"He said, “Call his name Lo-Ammi; for you are not my people, and I will not be yours."
Hosea,1,10,"Yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can’t be measured nor numbered; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’"
Hosea,1,11,"The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel."
Hosea,2,2,"Contend with your mother! Contend, for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her prostitution from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;"
Hosea,2,3,"Lest I strip her naked, and make her bare as in the day that she was born, and make her like a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst."
Hosea,2,4,"Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy; for they are children of unfaithfulness;"
Hosea,2,5,"For their mother has played the prostitute. She who conceived them has done shamefully; for she said, ‘I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.’"
Hosea,2,6,"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she can’t find her way."
Hosea,2,7,"She will follow after her lovers, but she won’t overtake them; and she will seek them, but won’t find them. Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.’"
Hosea,2,8,"For she did not know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, and my new wine in its season, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness."
Hosea,2,10,"Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and no one will deliver her out of my hand."
Hosea,2,11,"I will also cause all her celebrations to cease: her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies."
Hosea,2,12,"I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, about which she has said, ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest,’ and the animals of the field shall eat them."
Hosea,2,13,"I will visit on her the days of the Baals, to which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me,” says Yahweh. God’s Mercy to Israel 14“Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her."
Hosea,2,15,"I will give her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she will respond there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"It will be in that day,” says Yahweh, “that you will call me ‘my husband,’ and no longer call me ‘my master.’"
Hosea,2,17,"For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they will no longer be mentioned by name."
Hosea,2,18,"In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field, and with the birds of the sky, and with the creeping things of the ground. I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land, and will make them lie down safely."
Hosea,2,19,"I will betroth you to me forever. Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion."
Hosea,2,20,I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness; and you shall know Yahweh.
Hosea,2,21,"It will happen in that day, I will respond,” says Yahweh, “I will respond to the heavens, and they will respond to the earth; 22and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they will respond to Jezreel."
Hosea,2,23,"I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy; and I will tell those who were not my people, ‘You are my people;’ and they will say, ‘My God!’”"
Hosea,3,1,"Yahweh said to me, “Go again, love a woman loved by another, and an adulteress, even as Yahweh"
Hosea,3,2,So I bought
Hosea,3,3,"I said to her, “You shall stay with me many days. You shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be with any other man. I"
Hosea,3,4,"For the children of Israel shall live many days without king, and without"
Hosea,3,5,"Afterward the children of Israel shall return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king, and shall come with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of Yahweh, you children of Israel; for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land: “Indeed there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land."
Hosea,4,2,"There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery; they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed."
Hosea,4,3,"Therefore the land will mourn, and everyone who dwells therein will waste away. all living things in her, even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky; yes, the fish of the sea also die. 4“Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest."
Hosea,4,5,"You will stumble in the day, and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night; and I will destroy your mother."
Hosea,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you, that you may be no priest to me. Because you have forgotten your God’s law, I will also forget your children."
Hosea,4,7,"As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me. I will change their glory into shame."
Hosea,4,8,"They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity."
Hosea,4,9,"It will be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will repay them for their deeds."
Hosea,4,10,"They will eat, and not have enough. They will play the prostitute, and will not increase; because they have abandoned giving to Yahweh."
Hosea,4,11,"Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding."
Hosea,4,12,"My people consult with their wooden idol, and answer to a stick of wood. Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray, and they have been unfaithful to their God."
Hosea,4,13,"They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because its shade is good. Therefore your daughters play the prostitute, and your brides commit adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute, nor your brides when they commit adultery; because the men consort with prostitutes, and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes; so the people without understanding will come to ruin. 15“Though you, Israel, play the prostitute, yet don’t let Judah offend; and don’t come to Gilgal, neither go up to Beth Aven, nor swear, ‘As Yahweh lives.’"
Hosea,4,16,"For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer. Then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a meadow."
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim is joined to idols. Leave him alone!
Hosea,4,18,Their drink has become sour. They play the prostitute continually. Her rulers dearly love their shameful way.
Hosea,4,19,The wind has wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices.
Hosea,5,2,The rebels are deep in slaughter; but I discipline all of them.
Hosea,5,3,"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute. Israel is defiled."
Hosea,5,4,"Their deeds won’t allow them to turn to their God; for the spirit of prostitution is within them, and they don’t know Yahweh."
Hosea,5,5,The pride of Israel testifies to his face. Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity. Judah also will stumble with them.
Hosea,5,6,They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh; but they won’t find him. He has withdrawn himself from them.
Hosea,5,7,"They are unfaithful to Yahweh; for they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them with their fields. 8“Blow the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah! Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin!"
Hosea,5,9,"Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be."
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark. I will pour out my wrath on them like water.
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; Because he is intent in his pursuit of idols."
Hosea,5,12,"Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth, and to the house of Judah like rottenness. 13“When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, Then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound."
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be to Ephraim like a lion, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I myself will tear in pieces and go away. I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver."
Hosea,5,15,"I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face. In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.”"
Hosea,6,2,"After two days he will revive us. On the third day he will raise us up, and we will live before him."
Hosea,6,3,"Let us acknowledge Yahweh. Let us press on to know Yahweh. As surely as the sun rises, Yahweh will appear. He will come to us like the rain, like the spring rain that waters the earth.” 4“Ephraim, what shall I do to you? Judah, what shall I do to you? For your love is like a morning cloud, and like the dew that disappears early."
Hosea,6,5,Therefore I have cut them to pieces with the prophets; I killed them with the words of my mouth. Your judgments are like a flash of lightning.
Hosea,6,6,"For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings."
Hosea,6,7,"But they, like Adam, have broken the covenant. They were unfaithful to me, there."
Hosea,6,8,Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity; it is stained with blood.
Hosea,6,9,"As gangs of robbers wait to ambush a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem, committing shameful crimes."
Hosea,6,10,"In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing. There is prostitution in Ephraim. Israel is defiled. 11“Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, when I restore the fortunes of my people."
Hosea,7,1,"When I would heal Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, also the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief enters in, and the gang of robbers ravages outside."
Hosea,7,2,They don’t consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness. Now their own deeds have engulfed them. They are before my face.
Hosea,7,3,"They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies."
Hosea,7,4,"They are all adulterers. They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring, from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened."
Hosea,7,5,"On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine. He joined his hand with mockers."
Hosea,7,6,"For they have prepared their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait. Their baker sleeps all the night. In the morning it burns as a flaming fire."
Hosea,7,7,"They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges. All their kings have fallen. There is no one among them who calls to me."
Hosea,7,8,"Ephraim, he mixes himself among the nations. Ephraim is a pancake not turned over."
Hosea,7,9,"Strangers have devoured his strength, and he doesn’t realize it. Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him, and he doesn’t realize it."
Hosea,7,10,"The pride of Israel testifies to his face; yet they haven’t returned to Yahweh their God, nor sought him, for all this. 11“Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding. They call to Egypt. They go to Assyria."
Hosea,7,12,"When they go, I will spread my net on them. I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard."
Hosea,7,13,"Woe to them! For they have wandered from me. Destruction to them! For they have trespassed against me. Though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me."
Hosea,7,14,"They haven’t cried to me with their heart, but they howl on their beds. They assemble themselves for grain and new wine. They turn away from me."
Hosea,7,15,"Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet they plot evil against me."
Hosea,7,16,"They return, but not to the Most High. They are like a faulty bow. Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt."
Hosea,8,2,"They cry to me, ‘My God, we Israel acknowledge you!’"
Hosea,8,3,Israel has cast off that which is good. The enemy will pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,"They have set up kings, but not by me. They have made princes, and I didn’t approve. Of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols, that they may be cut off."
Hosea,8,5,Let Samaria throw out his calf idol! My anger burns against them! How long will it be until they are capable of purity?
Hosea,8,6,"For this is even from Israel! The workman made it, and it is no God; indeed, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces."
Hosea,8,7,"For they sow the wind, and they will reap the whirlwind. He has no standing grain. The stalk will yield no head. If it does yield, strangers will swallow it up."
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up. Now they are among the nations like a worthless thing.
Hosea,8,9,"For they have gone up to Assyria, like a wild donkey wandering alone. Ephraim has hired lovers for himself."
Hosea,8,10,"But although they sold themselves among the nations, I will now gather them; and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones."
Hosea,8,11,"Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, they became for him altars for sinning."
Hosea,8,12,I wrote for him the many things of my law; but they were regarded as a strange thing.
Hosea,8,13,"As for the sacrifices of my offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; But Yahweh doesn’t accept them. Now he will remember their iniquity, and punish their sins. They will return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; but I will send a fire on his cities, and it will devour its fortresses.”"
Hosea,9,1,"Don’t rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations; for you were unfaithful to your God. You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor."
Hosea,9,2,"The threshing floor and the winepress won’t feed them, and the new wine will fail her."
Hosea,9,3,"They won’t dwell in Yahweh’s land; but Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria."
Hosea,9,4,"They won’t pour out wine offerings to Yahweh, neither will they be pleasing to him. Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat of it will be polluted; for their bread will be for their appetite. It will not come into the house of Yahweh."
Hosea,9,5,"What will you do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Yahweh?"
Hosea,9,6,"For, behold, they have gone away from destruction. Egypt will gather them up. Memphis will bury them. Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver. Thorns will be in their tents."
Hosea,9,7,"The days of visitation have come. The days of reckoning have come. Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool, and the man who is inspired to be insane, because of the abundance of your sins, and because your hostility is great."
Hosea,9,8,"A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God. A fowler’s snare is on all of his paths, and hostility in the house of his God."
Hosea,9,9,"They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity. He will punish them for their sins."
Hosea,9,10,"I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season; but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved."
Hosea,9,11,"As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird. There will be no birth, none with child, and no conception."
Hosea,9,12,"Though they bring up their children, yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left. Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them!"
Hosea,9,13,"I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place; but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer."
Hosea,9,14,Give them—Yahweh what will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. 15“All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them. Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house! I will love them no more. All their princes are rebels.
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim is struck. Their root has dried up. They will bear no fruit. Even though they bring forth, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.”"
Hosea,9,17,"My God will cast them away, because they did not listen to him; and they will be wanderers among the nations."
Hosea,10,1,"Israel is a luxuriant vine that puts forth his fruit. According to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars. As their land has prospered, they have adorned their sacred stones."
Hosea,10,2,Their heart is divided. Now they will be found guilty. He will demolish their altars. He will destroy their sacred stones.
Hosea,10,3,"Surely now they will say, “We have no king; for we don’t fear Yahweh; and the king, what can he do for us?”"
Hosea,10,4,"They make promises, swearing falsely in making covenants. Therefore judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field."
Hosea,10,5,"The inhabitants of Samaria will be in terror for the calves of Beth Aven; for its people will mourn over it, Along with its priests who rejoiced over it, for its glory, because it has departed from it."
Hosea,10,6,"It also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king. Ephraim will receive shame, and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel."
Hosea,10,7,"Samaria and her king float away, like a twig on the water."
Hosea,10,8,"The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed. The thorn and the thistle will come up on their altars. They will tell the mountains, “Cover us!” and the hills, “Fall on us!” 9“Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah. There they remained. The battle against the children of iniquity doesn’t overtake them in Gibeah."
Hosea,10,10,"When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the nations will be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions."
Hosea,10,11,Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh; so I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck. I will set a rider on Ephraim. Judah will plow. Jacob will break his clods.
Hosea,10,12,"Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness. Break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek Yahweh, until he comes and rains righteousness on you."
Hosea,10,13,"You have plowed wickedness. You have reaped iniquity. You have eaten the fruit of lies, for you trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men."
Hosea,10,14,"Therefore a battle roar will arise among your people, and all your fortresses will be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle. The mother was dashed in pieces with her children."
Hosea,10,15,So Bethel will do to you because of your great wickedness. At daybreak the king of Israel will be destroyed.
Hosea,11,2,"They called to them, so they went from them. They sacrificed to the Baals, and burned incense to engraved images."
Hosea,11,3,Yet I taught Ephraim to walk. I took them by his arms; but they didn’t know that I healed them.
Hosea,11,4,"I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of love; and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks; and I bent down to him and I fed him. 5“They won’t return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian will be their king, because they refused to repent."
Hosea,11,6,"The sword will fall on their cities, and will destroy the bars of their gates, and will put an end to their plans."
Hosea,11,7,"My people are determined to turn from me. Though they call to the Most High, he certainly won’t exalt them. God’s Love for Israel 8“How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned within me, my compassion is aroused."
Hosea,11,9,"I will not execute the fierceness of my anger. I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of you; and I will not come in wrath."
Hosea,11,10,"They will walk after Yahweh, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children will come trembling from the west."
Hosea,11,11,"They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt, and like a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will settle them in their houses,” says Yahweh."
Hosea,11,12,"Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit. Judah still strays from God, and is unfaithful to the Holy One."
Hosea,12,1,"Ephraim feeds on wind, and chases the east wind. He continually multiplies lies and desolation. They make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt."
Hosea,12,2,"Yahweh also has a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his deeds he will repay him."
Hosea,12,3,In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he contended with God.
Hosea,12,4,"Indeed, he struggled with the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication to him. He found him at Bethel, and there he spoke with us, 5even Yahweh, the God of Armies; Yahweh is his name of renown!"
Hosea,12,6,"Therefore turn to your God. Keep kindness and justice, and wait continually for your God."
Hosea,12,7,A merchant has dishonest scales in his hand. He loves to defraud.
Hosea,12,8,"Ephraim said, “Surely I have become rich, I have found myself wealth. In all my wealth they won’t find in me any iniquity that is sin.” 9“But I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt. I will yet again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast."
Hosea,12,10,"I have also spoken to the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets I have used parables."
Hosea,12,11,"If Gilead is wicked, surely they are worthless. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls. Indeed, their altars are like heaps in the furrows of the field."
Hosea,12,12,"Jacob fled into the country of Aram, and Israel served to get a wife, and for a wife he tended flocks and herds."
Hosea,12,13,"By a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved."
Hosea,12,14,"Ephraim has bitterly provoked anger. Therefore his blood will be left on him, and his Lord will repay his contempt."
Hosea,13,1,"When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling. He exalted himself in Israel, but when he became guilty in Baal, he died."
Hosea,13,2,"Now they sin more and more, and have made themselves molten images of their silver, even idols according to their own understanding, all of them the work of the craftsmen. They say of them, ‘They offer human sacrifice and kiss the calves.’"
Hosea,13,3,"Therefore they will be like the morning mist, and like the dew that passes away early, like the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor, and like the smoke out of the chimney. 4“Yet I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt; and you shall acknowledge no god but me, and besides me there is no savior."
Hosea,13,5,"I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of great drought."
Hosea,13,6,"According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted. Therefore they have forgotten me."
Hosea,13,7,"Therefore I am like a lion to them. Like a leopard, I will lurk by the path."
Hosea,13,8,"I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs, and will tear the covering of their heart. There I will devour them like a lioness. The wild animal will tear them. Death and Resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:50–58)"
Hosea,13,9,"You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me, against your help."

Hosea,13,11,"I have given you a king in my anger, and have taken him away in my wrath."
Hosea,13,12,The guilt of Ephraim is stored up. His sin is stored up.
Hosea,13,13,"The sorrows of a travailing woman will come on him. He is an unwise son; for when it is time, he doesn’t come to the opening of the womb."
Hosea,13,14,"I will ransom them from the power of Sheol. I will redeem them from death! Death, where are your plagues? Sheol, where is your destruction? “Compassion will be hidden from my eyes. Judgment on Samaria"
Hosea,13,15,"Though he is fruitful among his brothers, an east wind will come, the breath of Yahweh coming up from the wilderness; and his spring will become dry, and his fountain will be dried up. He will plunder the storehouse of treasure."
Hosea,13,16,"Samaria will bear her guilt; for she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword. Their infants will be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women will be ripped open.”"
Hosea,14,1,"Israel, return to Yahweh your God; for you have fallen because of your sin."
Hosea,14,2,"Take words with you, and return to Yahweh. Tell him, “Forgive all our sins, and accept that which is good: so we offer our lips like bulls."

Joel,1,11,"Be confounded, you farmers! Wail, you vineyard keepers; for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field has perished."
Joel,1,12,"The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all of the trees of the field are withered; for joy has withered away from the sons of men. A Call to Repentance (Amos 5:4–15; Zephaniah 2:1–3; Luke 13:1–5)"
Joel,1,13,"Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests! Wail, you ministers of the altar. Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God, for the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from your God’s house."
Joel,1,14,"Sanctify a fast. Call a solemn assembly. Gather the elders, and all the inhabitants of the land, to the house of Yahweh, your God, and cry to Yahweh."

Joel,2,1,"Blow the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of Yahweh comes, for it is close at hand:"
Joel,2,2,"A day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness. As the dawn spreading on the mountains, a great and strong people; there has never been the like, neither will there be any more after them, even to the years of many generations."

Joel,2,4,"Their appearance is as the appearance of horses, and as horsemen, so do they run."
Joel,2,5,"Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array."
Joel,2,6,At their presence the peoples are in anguish. All faces have grown pale.
Joel,2,7,"They run like mighty men. They climb the wall like warriors. They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course."
Joel,2,8,"Neither does one jostle another; they march everyone in his path, and they burst through the defenses, and don’t break ranks."
Joel,2,9,They rush on the city. They run on the wall. They climb up into the houses. They enter in at the windows like thieves.
Joel,2,10,"The earth quakes before them. The heavens tremble. The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining."
Joel,2,11,"Yahweh thunders his voice before his army; for his forces are very great; for he is strong who obeys his command; for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome, and who can endure it? Return with All Your Heart 12“Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.”"
Joel,2,13,"Tear your heart, and not your garments, and turn to Yahweh, your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and relents from sending calamity."
Joel,2,14,"Who knows? He may turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your God."
Joel,2,15,Blow the trumpet in Zion! Sanctify a fast. Call a solemn assembly.
Joel,2,16,"Gather the people. Sanctify the assembly. Assemble the elders. Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts. Let the bridegroom go forth from his room, and the bride out of her room."
Joel,2,17,"Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh, and don’t give your heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’” Restoration Promised"
Joel,2,18,"Then Yahweh was jealous for his land, And had pity on his people."
Joel,2,19,"Yahweh answered his people, “Behold, I will send you grain, new wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied with them; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations."
Joel,2,20,"But I will remove the northern army far away from you, and will drive it into a barren and desolate land, its front into the eastern sea, and its back into the western sea; and its stench will come up, and its bad smell will rise.” Surely he has done great things."
Joel,2,21,"Land, don’t be afraid. Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things."
Joel,2,22,"Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness spring up, for the tree bears its fruit. The fig tree and the vine yield their strength. 23“Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in Yahweh, your God; for he gives you the former rain in just measure, and he causes the rain to come down for you, the former rain and the latter rain, as before."

Joel,2,27,"You will know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Yahweh, your God, and there is no one else; and my people will never again be disappointed. I Will Pour Out My Spirit (Acts 2:14–36) 28“It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams. Your young men will see visions."

Joel,3,2,"I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will execute judgment on them there for my people, and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations. They have divided my land, 3and have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink. 4“Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Will you repay me?"
Joel,3,5,"Because you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my finest treasures into your temples, 6and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks, that you may"
Joel,3,7,"Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them, and will return your repayment on your own head; 8and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah, and they will sell them to the men of Sheba, to a faraway nation, for Yahweh has spoken it.”"

Amos,3,12,"Thus says Yahweh: “As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the children of Israel be rescued who sit in Samaria on the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed.” 13“Listen, and testify against the house of Jacob,” says the Lord Yahweh, the God of Armies. 14“For in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel on him, I will also visit the altars of Bethel; and the horns of the altar will be cut off, and fall to the ground."

Amos,6,7,"Therefore they will now go captive with the first who go captive; and the feasting and lounging will end.

Therefore I will deliver up the city with all that is in it."
Amos,6,9,"It will happen, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die. 10“When a man’s relative carries him, even he who burns him, to bring bodies out of the house, and asks him who is in the innermost parts of the house, ‘Is there yet any with you?’ And he says, ‘No;’ then he will say, ‘Hush!

Amos,7,14,"Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a farmer of sycamore figs; 15and Yahweh took me from following the flock, and Yahweh"
Amos,7,16,Now therefore listen to the word of Yahweh: ‘You

Amos,9,6,"It is he who builds his rooms in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth; Yahweh is his name."
Amos,9,7,"Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?” says Yahweh. “Haven’t I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?"
Amos,9,8,"Behold, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” says Yahweh. 9“For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth."
Amos,9,10,"All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, ‘Evil won’t overtake nor meet us.’ A Promise of Restoration (Acts 15:5–21)"
Amos,9,11,"In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old; 12that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by my name,” says Yahweh who does this. 13“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the one treading grapes him who sows seed; and sweet wine will drip from the mountains, and flow from the hills."
Amos,9,14,"I will bring my people Israel back from captivity, and they will rebuild the ruined cities, and inhabit them; and they will plant vineyards, and drink wine from them. They shall also make gardens, and eat their fruit."
Amos,9,15,"I will plant them on their land, and they will no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them,” says Yahweh your God."
Obadiah,1,1,"The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Lord Yahweh says about Edom. We have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, “Arise, and let’s rise up against her in battle."
Obadiah,1,2,"Behold, I have made you small among the nations. You are greatly despised."
Obadiah,1,3,"The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high, who says in his heart, ‘Who will bring me down to the ground?’"
Obadiah,1,4,"Though you mount on high as the eagle, and though your nest is set among the stars, I will bring you down from there,” says Yahweh. 5“If thieves came to you, if robbers by night—oh, what disaster awaits you—wouldn’t they only steal until they had enough? If grape pickers came to you, wouldn’t they leave some gleaning grapes?"
Obadiah,1,6,How Esau will be ransacked! How his hidden treasures are sought out!
Obadiah,1,7,"All the men of your alliance have brought you on your way, even to the border. The men who were at peace with you have deceived you, and prevailed against you. Friends who eat your bread lay a snare under you. There is no understanding in him.” 8“Won’t I in that day,” says Yahweh, “destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mountain of Esau?"
Obadiah,1,9,"Your mighty men, Teman, will be dismayed, to the end that everyone may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter."
Obadiah,1,10,"For the violence done to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will be cut off forever."
Obadiah,1,11,"In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots for Jerusalem, even you were like one of them."
Obadiah,1,12,"But don’t look down on your brother in the day of his disaster, and don’t rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction. Don’t speak proudly in the day of distress."
Obadiah,1,13,"Don’t enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity. Don’t look down on their affliction in the day of their calamity, neither seize their wealth on the day of their calamity."
Obadiah,1,14,Don’t stand in the crossroads to cut off those of his who escape. Don’t deliver up those of his who remain in the day of distress. The Deliverance of Israel
Obadiah,1,15,"For the day of Yahweh is near all the nations! As you have done, it will be done to you. Your deeds will return upon your own head."
Obadiah,1,16,"For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, so will all the nations drink continually. Yes, they will drink, swallow down, and will be as though they had not been."
Obadiah,1,17,"But in Mount Zion, there will be those who escape, and it will be holy. The house of Jacob will possess their possessions."
Obadiah,1,18,"The house of Jacob will be a fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble. They will burn among them, and devour them. There will not be any remaining to the house of Esau.” Indeed, Yahweh has spoken."
Obadiah,1,19,"Those of the South will possess the mountain of Esau, and those of the lowland, the Philistines. They will possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria. Benjamin will possess Gilead."
Obadiah,1,20,"The captives of this army of the children of Israel, who are among the Canaanites, will possess even to Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, will possess the cities of the Negev."
Obadiah,1,21,"Saviors will go up on Mount Zion to judge the mountains of Esau, and the kingdom will be Yahweh’s."
Jonah,1,1,"Now the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, 2“Arise, go to Nineveh, that great"
Jonah,1,3,"But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh. He went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid its fare, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh. The Great Storm (Acts 27:13–26)"
Jonah,1,4,"But Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea, and there was a mighty storm on the sea, so that the"
Jonah,1,5,"Then the mariners were afraid, and every man cried to his god. They threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone down into"
Jonah,1,6,"So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, “What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, call on your God! Maybe your God will notice us, so that we won’t perish.”"
Jonah,1,7,"They all said to each other, “Come, let us cast lots, that we may know who is responsible for this evil"
Jonah,1,8,"Then they asked him, “Tell us, please, for whose cause this evil is on us. What is your occupation? Where do you come from? What is your"
Jonah,1,9,"He said to them, “I am a Hebrew, and I fear Yahweh, the God of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land.”"
Jonah,1,10,"Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him, “What is this that you have done?” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Yahweh, because he had told them. Jonah Cast into the Sea"
Jonah,1,11,"Then they said to him, “What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us?” For the sea grew"
Jonah,1,12,"He said to them, “Take me up, and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will"
Jonah,1,13,"Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not, for the sea grew more and more stormy"
Jonah,1,14,"Therefore they cried to Yahweh, and said, “We beg you, Yahweh, we beg you, don’t let us die for this man’s life, and don’t lay on us innocent blood; for you, Yahweh, have done as it pleased you.”"
Jonah,1,15,"So they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea ceased its raging."
Jonah,1,16,"Then the men feared Yahweh exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh, and made vows."
Jonah,1,17,"Yahweh prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights."
Jonah,2,1,"Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish’s belly."
Jonah,2,2,"He said, “I called because of my affliction to Yahweh. He answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried. You heard my voice."
Jonah,2,3,"For you threw me into the depths, in the heart of the seas. The flood was all around me. All your waves and your billows passed over me."
Jonah,2,4,"I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.’"
Jonah,2,5,"The waters surrounded me, even to the soul. The deep was around me. The weeds were wrapped around my head."
Jonah,2,6,"I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth barred me in forever: yet have you brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh my God. 7“When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh. My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple."
Jonah,2,8,Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
Jonah,2,9,But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation belongs to Yahweh.”
Jonah,2,10,"Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land."
Jonah,3,1,"The word of Yahweh came to Jonah the second time, saying, 2“Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city,"
Jonah,3,3,"So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the"
Jonah,3,4,"Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried out, and said, “In forty days, Nineveh will be overthrown!”"
Jonah,3,5,"The people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from their"
Jonah,3,6,"The news reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne,"
Jonah,3,7,"He made a proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, “Let neither man nor animal, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water; 8but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and animal, and let them cry mightily to God. Yes, let them turn everyone"
Jonah,3,9,"Who knows whether God will not turn and relent, and turn away from his fierce anger, so that we might not perish?”"
Jonah,3,10,"God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way. God relented of the disaster which he said he would do to them, and he didn’t do it."
Jonah,4,1,"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry."
Jonah,4,2,"He prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Please, Yahweh, wasn’t this what I said when I was still in my own country? Therefore I hurried to flee to Tarshish, for I knew that you are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving"
Jonah,4,3,"Therefore now, Yahweh, take, I beg you, my life from me;"
Jonah,4,4,"Yahweh said, “Is it right for you to be angry?”"
Jonah,4,5,"Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made himself a booth,"
Jonah,4,6,"Yahweh God prepared a vine, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from"
Jonah,4,7,But God prepared a worm at dawn
Jonah,4,8,"It happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah’s head, so that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.”"
Jonah,4,9,"God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the vine?” He said, “I am right to be angry,"
Jonah,4,10,"Yahweh said, “You have been concerned for the vine, for which you have not labored,"
Jonah,4,11,"Shouldn’t I be concerned for Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred twenty thousand persons who can’t discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much livestock?”"
Micah,1,1,"The word of Yahweh that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem."
Micah,1,2,"Hear, you peoples, all of you. Listen, O earth, and all that is therein: and let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple."
Micah,1,3,"For, behold, Yahweh comes forth out of his place, and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth."
Micah,1,4,"The mountains melt under him, and the valleys split apart, like wax before the fire, like waters that are poured down a steep place. 5“All this is for the disobedience of Jacob, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the disobedience of Jacob? Isn’t it Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? Aren’t they Jerusalem?"
Micah,1,6,"Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field, like places for planting vineyards; and I will pour down its stones into the valley, and I will uncover its foundations."
Micah,1,7,"All her idols will be beaten to pieces, and all her temple gifts will be burned with fire, and all her images I will destroy; for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them, and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return.” Weeping and Mourning"
Micah,1,8,"For this I will lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will howl like the jackals, and moan like the daughters of owls."
Micah,1,9,"For her wounds are incurable; for it has come even to Judah. It reaches to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem."
Micah,1,10,Don’t tell it in Gath. Don’t weep at all. At Beth Ophrah I have rolled myself in the dust.
Micah,1,11,"Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame. The inhabitant of Zaanan won’t come out. The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection."
Micah,1,12,"For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good, because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem."
Micah,1,13,"Harness the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant of Lachish. She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; For the transgressions of Israel were found in you."
Micah,1,14,Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath. The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel.
Micah,1,15,"I will yet bring to you, inhabitant of Mareshah. He who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam."
Micah,1,16,"Shave your heads, and cut off your hair for the children of your delight. Enlarge your baldness like the vulture; for they have gone into captivity from you!"
Micah,2,1,"Woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil on their beds! When the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand."
Micah,2,2,"They covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage."
Micah,2,3,"Therefore thus says Yahweh: “Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster, from which you will not remove your necks, neither will you walk haughtily; for it is an evil time."
Micah,2,4,"In that day they will take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying, ‘We are utterly ruined! My people’s possession is divided up. Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’”"
Micah,2,5,Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in the assembly of Yahweh. Reproof of False Prophets (Ezekiel 13:1–16) 6“Don’t prophesy!” They prophesy. “Don’t prophesy about these things. Disgrace won’t overtake us.”
Micah,2,7,"Shall it be said, O house of Jacob: “Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry? Are these his doings? Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?”"
Micah,2,8,"But lately my people have risen up as an enemy. You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle."
Micah,2,9,You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses; from their young children you take away my blessing forever.
Micah,2,10,"Arise, and depart! For this is not your resting place, because of uncleanness that destroys, even with a grievous destruction."
Micah,2,11,If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies: “I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink;” he would be the prophet of this people. The Remnant of Israel (Micah 5:7–15)
Micah,2,12,"I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they will swarm with people."
Micah,2,13,"He who breaks open the way goes up before them. They break through the gate, and go out. And their king passes on before them, with Yahweh at their head."
Micah,3,1,"I said, “Please listen, you heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: Isn’t it for you to know justice?"
Micah,3,2,"You who hate the good, and love the evil; who tear off their skin, and their flesh from off their bones; 3who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron."
Micah,3,4,"Then they will cry to Yahweh, but he will not answer them. Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time, because they made their deeds evil.”"
Micah,3,5,"Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever doesn’t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him: 6“Therefore night is over you, with no vision, and it is dark to you, that you may not divine; and the sun will go down on the prophets, and the day will be black over them."
Micah,3,7,"The seers shall be disappointed, and the diviners confounded. Yes, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer from God.”"
Micah,3,8,"But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh, and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his disobedience, and to Israel his sin."
Micah,3,9,"Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, who abhor justice, and pervert all equity."
Micah,3,10,"They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity."
Micah,3,11,"Her leaders judge for bribes, and her priests teach for a price, and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money: yet they lean on Yahweh, and say, “Isn’t Yahweh in the midst of us? No disaster will come on us.”"
Micah,3,12,"Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble, and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest."
Micah,4,1,"But in the latter days, it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains, and it will be exalted above the hills; and peoples will stream to it."
Micah,4,2,"Many nations will go and say, “Come, and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” For out of Zion will go forth the law, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem; 3and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off. They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war any more."
Micah,4,4,But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and no one will make them afraid: For the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.
Micah,4,5,"Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods; but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever. The Restoration of Zion (Zechariah 8:1–23) 6“In that day,” says Yahweh, “I will assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted; 7and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.”"
Micah,4,8,"You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, to you it will come, yes, the former dominion will come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem."
Micah,4,9,"Now why do you cry out aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?"
Micah,4,10,"Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now you will go forth out of the city, and will dwell in the field, and will come even to Babylon. There you will be rescued. There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies."
Micah,4,11,"Now many nations have assembled against you, that say, “Let her be defiled, and let our eye gloat over Zion.”"
Micah,4,12,"But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh, neither do they understand his counsel; for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor."
Micah,4,13,"Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion; for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs brass; and you will beat in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain to Yahweh, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth."
Micah,5,1,"Now you shall gather yourself in troops, daughter of troops. He has laid siege against us. They will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek."
Micah,5,2,"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, being small among the clans of Judah, out of you one will come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting."
Micah,5,3,Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth. Then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel.
Micah,5,4,"He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh, in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God: and they will live, for then he will be great to the ends of the earth."
Micah,5,5,"He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land, and when he marches through our fortresses, then we will raise against him seven shepherds, and eight leaders of men."
Micah,5,6,"They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in its gates. He will deliver us from the Assyrian, when he invades our land, and when he marches within our border. The Remnant of Jacob (Micah 2:12–13)"
Micah,5,7,"The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples, like dew from Yahweh, like showers on the grass, that don’t wait for man, nor wait for the sons of men."
Micah,5,8,"The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the animals of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, and there is no one to deliver."
Micah,5,9,"Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries, and let all of your enemies be cut off. 10“It will happen in that day,” says Yahweh, “That I will cut off your horses out of the midst of you, and will destroy your chariots."
Micah,5,11,"I will cut off the cities of your land, and will tear down all your strongholds."
Micah,5,12,I will destroy witchcraft from your hand; and you shall have no soothsayers.
Micah,5,13,I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out of your midst; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.
Micah,5,14,I will uproot your Asherim out of your midst; and I will destroy your cities.
Micah,5,15,"I will execute vengeance in anger, and wrath on the nations that didn’t listen.”"
Micah,6,1,"Listen now to what Yahweh says: “Arise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear what you have to say."
Micah,6,2,"Hear, you mountains, Yahweh’s controversy, and you enduring foundations of the earth; for Yahweh has a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel."
Micah,6,3,"My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me!"
Micah,6,4,"For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage. I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam."
Micah,6,5,"My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh.”"
Micah,6,6,"How shall I come before Yahweh, and bow myself before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?"
Micah,6,7,Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams? With tens of thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience? The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
Micah,6,8,"He has shown you, O man, what is good. What does Yahweh require of you, but to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God? The Punishment of Israel"
Micah,6,9,"Yahweh’s voice calls to the city, and wisdom sees your name: “Listen to the rod, and he who appointed it."
Micah,6,10,"Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a short ephah that is accursed?"
Micah,6,11,"Shall I be pure with dishonest scales, and with a bag of deceitful weights?"
Micah,6,12,"Her rich men are full of violence, her inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their speech."
Micah,6,13,Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound. I have made you desolate because of your sins.
Micah,6,14,"You shall eat, but not be satisfied. Your humiliation will be in your midst. You will store up, but not save; and that which you save I will give up to the sword."
Micah,6,15,"You will sow, but won’t reap. You will tread the olives, but won’t anoint yourself with oil; and crush grapes, but won’t drink the wine."
Micah,6,16,"For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab. You walk in their counsels, that I may make you a ruin, and her inhabitants a hissing; And you will bear the reproach of my people.”"
Micah,7,1,"Misery is mine! Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard: There is no cluster of grapes to eat. My soul desires to eat the early fig."
Micah,7,2,"The godly man has perished out of the earth, and there is no one upright among men. They all lie in wait for blood; every man hunts his brother with a net."
Micah,7,3,Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently. The ruler and judge ask for a bribe; and the powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul. Thus they conspire together.
Micah,7,4,"The best of them is like a brier. The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen, even your visitation, has come; now is the time of their confusion."
Micah,7,5,"Don’t trust in a neighbor. Don’t put confidence in a friend. With the woman lying in your embrace, be careful of the words of your mouth!"
Micah,7,6,"For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own house. Israel’s Confession and Comfort"
Micah,7,7,"But as for me, I will look to Yahweh. I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me."
Micah,7,8,"Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy. When I fall, I will arise. When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me."
Micah,7,9,"I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, because I have sinned against him, until he pleads my case, and executes judgment for me. He will bring me forth to the light. I will see his righteousness."
Micah,7,10,"Then my enemy will see it, and shame will cover her who said to me, where is Yahweh your God? Then my enemy will see me and will cover her shame. Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets."
Micah,7,11,"A day to build your walls—In that day, he will extend your boundary."
Micah,7,12,"In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain."
Micah,7,13,"Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings. God’s Compassion on Israel"
Micah,7,14,"Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your heritage, who dwell by themselves in a forest, in the midst of fertile pasture land, let them feed; in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 15“As in the days of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things.”"
Micah,7,16,The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might. They will lay their hand on their mouth. Their ears will be deaf.
Micah,7,17,"They will lick the dust like a serpent. Like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens. They will come with fear to Yahweh our God, and will be afraid because of you."
Micah,7,18,"Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity, and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage? He doesn’t retain his anger forever, because he delights in loving kindness."
Micah,7,19,He will again have compassion on us. He will tread our iniquities under foot; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
Micah,7,20,"You will give truth to Jacob, and mercy to Abraham, as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old."
Nahum,1,1,An oracle about Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
Nahum,1,2,"Yahweh is a jealous God and avenges. Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath. Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he maintains wrath against his enemies."
Nahum,1,3,"Yahweh is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. Yahweh has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet."
Nahum,1,4,"He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan languishes, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languishes."
Nahum,1,5,"The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, yes, the world, and all who dwell in it."
Nahum,1,6,"Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him."
Nahum,1,7,"Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knows those who take refuge in him."
Nahum,1,8,"But with an overflowing flood, he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness."
Nahum,1,9,What do you plot against Yahweh? He will make a full end. Affliction won’t rise up the second time.
Nahum,1,10,"For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly like dry stubble."
Nahum,1,11,"There is one gone forth out of you, who devises evil against Yahweh, who counsels wickedness."
Nahum,1,12,"Thus says Yahweh: “Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so they will be cut down, and he shall pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more."
Nahum,1,13,"Now will I break his yoke from off you, and will burst your bonds apart.”"
Nahum,1,14,"Yahweh has commanded concerning you: “No more descendants will bear your name. Out of the house of your gods, will I cut off the engraved image and the molten image. I will make your grave, for you are vile.”"
Nahum,1,15,"Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace! Keep your feasts, Judah! Perform your vows, for the wicked one will no more pass through you. He is utterly cut off."
Nahum,2,1,He who dashes in pieces has come up against you. Keep the fortress! Watch the way! Strengthen your waist! Fortify your power mightily!
Nahum,2,2,"For Yahweh restores the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the destroyers have destroyed them, and ruined their vine branches."
Nahum,2,3,"The shield of his mighty men is made red. The valiant men are in scarlet. The chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the pine spears are brandished."
Nahum,2,4,The chariots rage in the streets. They rush back and forth in the broad ways. Their appearance is like torches. They run like the lightnings.
Nahum,2,5,"He summons his picked troops. They stumble on their way. They dash to its wall, and the protective shield is put in place."
Nahum,2,6,"The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved."
Nahum,2,7,"It is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating on their breasts."
Nahum,2,8,"But Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water, yet they flee away. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one looks back."
Nahum,2,9,"Take the spoil of silver. Take the spoil of gold, for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture."
Nahum,2,10,"She is empty, void, and waste. The heart melts, the knees knock together, their bodies and faces have grown pale."
Nahum,2,11,"Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked, the lion’s cubs, and no one made them afraid?"
Nahum,2,12,"The lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with the kill, and his dens with prey. 13“Behold, I am against you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions; and I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard.”"
Nahum,3,1,Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lies and robbery. The prey doesn’t depart.
Nahum,3,2,"The noise of the whip, the noise of the rattling of wheels, prancing horses, and bounding chariots, 3the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies. They stumble on their bodies, 4because of the multitude of the prostitution of the alluring prostitute, the mistress of witchcraft, who sells nations through her prostitution, and families through her witchcraft. 5“Behold, I am against you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show the nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame."
Nahum,3,6,"I will throw abominable filth on you, and make you vile, and will set you a spectacle."
Nahum,3,7,"It will happen that all those who look at you will flee from you, and say, ‘Nineveh is laid waste! Who will mourn for her?’ Where will I seek comforters for you?”"
Nahum,3,8,"Are you better than No-Amon, who was situated among the rivers, who had the waters around her; whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was of the sea?"
Nahum,3,9,Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength. Put and Libya were her helpers.
Nahum,3,10,"Yet was she carried away. She went into captivity. Her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets, and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains."
Nahum,3,11,You also will be drunken. You will be hidden. You also will seek a stronghold because of the enemy.
Nahum,3,12,"All your fortresses will be like fig trees with the first-ripe figs: if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater."
Nahum,3,13,"Behold, your troops in your midst are women. The gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies. The fire has devoured your bars."
Nahum,3,14,"Draw water for the siege. Strengthen your fortresses. Go into the clay, and tread the mortar. Make the brick kiln strong."
Nahum,3,15,There the fire will devour you. The sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the grasshopper. Multiply like grasshoppers. Multiply like the locust.
Nahum,3,16,"You have increased your merchants more than the stars of the skies. The grasshopper strips, and flees away."
Nahum,3,17,"Your guards are like the locusts, and your officials like the swarms of locusts, which settle on the walls on a cold day, but when the sun appears, they flee away, and their place is not known where they are."
Nahum,3,18,"Your shepherds slumber, king of Assyria. Your nobles lie down. Your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no one to gather them."
Nahum,3,19,"There is no healing your wound, for your injury is fatal. All who hear the report of you clap their hands over you; for who hasn’t felt your endless cruelty?"
Habakkuk,1,1,The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
Habakkuk,1,2,"Yahweh, how long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you “Violence!” and will you not save?"
Habakkuk,1,3,"Why do you show me iniquity, and look at perversity? For destruction and violence are before me. There is strife, and contention rises up."
Habakkuk,1,4,"Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never goes forth; for the wicked surround the righteous; therefore justice goes forth perverted. The LORD’s Answer 5“Look among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is told you."
Habakkuk,1,6,"For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs."
Habakkuk,1,7,They are feared and dreaded. Their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.
Habakkuk,1,8,"Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves. Their horsemen press proudly on. Yes, their horsemen come from afar. They fly as an eagle that hurries to devour."
Habakkuk,1,9,All of them come for violence. Their hordes face the desert. He gathers prisoners like sand.
Habakkuk,1,10,"Yes, he scoffs at kings, and princes are a derision to him. He laughs at every stronghold, for he builds up an earthen ramp, and takes it."
Habakkuk,1,11,"Then he sweeps by like the wind, and goes on. He is indeed guilty, whose strength is his god.” Habakkuk’s Second Complaint (Psalm 11:1–7)"
Habakkuk,1,12,"Aren’t you from everlasting, Yahweh my God, my Holy One? We will not die. Yahweh, you have appointed him for judgment. You, Rock, have established him to punish."
Habakkuk,1,13,"You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he, 14and make men like the fish of the sea, like the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?"
Habakkuk,1,15,"He takes up all of them with the hook. He catches them in his net, and gathers them in his dragnet. Therefore he rejoices and is glad."
Habakkuk,1,16,"Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his dragnet, because by them his life is luxurious, and his food is good."
Habakkuk,1,17,"Will he therefore continually empty his net, and kill the nations without mercy?"
Habakkuk,2,1,"I will stand at my watch, and set myself on the ramparts, and will look out to see what he will say to me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint."
Habakkuk,2,2,"Yahweh answered me, “Write the vision, and make it plain on tablets, that he who runs may read it."
Habakkuk,2,3,"For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hurries toward the end, and won’t prove false. Though it takes time, wait for it; because it will surely come. It won’t delay."
Habakkuk,2,4,"Behold, his soul is puffed up. It is not upright in him, but the righteous will live by his faith."
Habakkuk,2,5,"Yes, moreover, wine is treacherous. A haughty man who doesn’t stay at home, who enlarges his desire as Sheol, and he is like death, and can’t be satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations, and heaps to himself all peoples. Woe to the Chaldeans"
Habakkuk,2,6,"Won’t all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, ‘Woe to him who increases that which is not his, and who enriches himself by extortion! How long?’"
Habakkuk,2,7,"Won’t your debtors rise up suddenly, and wake up those who make you tremble, and you will be their victim?"
Habakkuk,2,8,"Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it."
Habakkuk,2,9,"Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!"
Habakkuk,2,10,"You have devised shame to your house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul."
Habakkuk,2,11,"For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it."
Habakkuk,2,12,"Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!"
Habakkuk,2,13,"Behold, isn’t it of Yahweh of Armies that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?"
Habakkuk,2,14,"For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea. 15“Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink, pouring your inflaming wine until they are drunk, so that you may gaze at their naked bodies!"
Habakkuk,2,16,"You are filled with shame, and not glory. You will also drink, and be exposed! The cup of Yahweh’s right hand will come around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory."
Habakkuk,2,17,"For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of the animals, which made them afraid; because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to every city and to those who dwell in them. 18“What value does the engraved image have, that its maker has engraved it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols?"
Habakkuk,2,19,"Woe to him who says to the wood, ‘Awake!’ or to the mute stone, ‘Arise!’ Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in its midst."
Habakkuk,2,20,But Yahweh is in his holy temple. Let all the earth be silent before him!”
Habakkuk,3,1,"A prayer of Habakkuk, the prophet, set to victorious music."
Habakkuk,3,2,"Yahweh, I have heard of your fame. I stand in awe of your deeds, Yahweh. Renew your work in the midst of the years. In the midst of the years make it known. In wrath, you remember mercy."
Habakkuk,3,3,"God came from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and his praise filled the earth."
Habakkuk,3,4,"His splendor is like the sunrise. Rays shine from his hand, where his power is hidden."
Habakkuk,3,5,"Plague went before him, and pestilence followed his feet."
Habakkuk,3,6,"He stood, and shook the earth. He looked, and made the nations tremble. The ancient mountains were crumbled. The age-old hills collapsed. His ways are eternal."
Habakkuk,3,7,I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction. The dwellings of the land of Midian trembled.
Habakkuk,3,8,"Was Yahweh displeased with the rivers? Was your anger against the rivers, or your wrath against the sea, that you rode on your horses, on your chariots of salvation?"
Habakkuk,3,9,You uncovered your bow. You called for your sworn arrows. Selah. You split the earth with rivers.
Habakkuk,3,10,"The mountains saw you, and were afraid. The storm of waters passed by. The deep roared and lifted up its hands on high."
Habakkuk,3,11,"The sun and moon stood still in the sky, at the light of your arrows as they went, at the shining of your glittering spear."
Habakkuk,3,12,You marched through the land in wrath. You threshed the nations in anger.
Habakkuk,3,13,"You went forth for the salvation of your people, for the salvation of your anointed. You crushed the head of the land of wickedness. You stripped them head to foot. Selah."
Habakkuk,3,14,"You pierced the heads of his warriors with their own spears. They came as a whirlwind to scatter me, gloating as if to devour the wretched in secret."
Habakkuk,3,15,"You trampled the sea with your horses, churning mighty waters."
Habakkuk,3,16,"I heard, and my body trembled. My lips quivered at the voice. Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in my place, because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, for the coming up of the people who invade us. Habakkuk Rejoices"
Habakkuk,3,17,"For though the fig tree doesn’t flourish, nor fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive fails, the fields yield no food; the flocks are cut off from the fold, and there is no herd in the stalls: 18yet I will rejoice in Yahweh. I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!"
Habakkuk,3,19,"Yahweh, the Lord, is my strength. He makes my feet like deer’s feet, and enables me to go in high places. For the music director, on my stringed instruments."
Zephaniah,1,1,"The word of Yahweh which came to Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah."
Zephaniah,1,2,"I will utterly sweep away everything off of the surface of the earth, says Yahweh."
Zephaniah,1,3,"I will sweep away man and animal. I will sweep away the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and the heaps of rubble with the wicked. I will cut off man from the surface of the earth, says Yahweh."
Zephaniah,1,4,"I will stretch out my hand against Judah, and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place: the name of the idolatrous and pagan priests, 5those who worship the army of the sky on the housetops, those who worship and swear by Yahweh and also swear by Malcam, 6those who have turned back from following Yahweh, and those who haven’t sought Yahweh nor inquired after him. The Day of the LORD (Malachi 4:1–6; 1 Thessalonians 5:1–11; 2 Peter 3:8–13)"
Zephaniah,1,7,"Be silent at the presence of the Lord Yahweh, for the day of Yahweh is at hand. For Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice. He has consecrated his guests."
Zephaniah,1,8,"It will happen in the day of Yahweh’s sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, the king’s sons, and all those who are clothed with foreign clothing."
Zephaniah,1,9,"In that day, I will punish all those who leap over the threshold, who fill their master’s house with violence and deceit."
Zephaniah,1,10,"In that day, says Yahweh, there will be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills."
Zephaniah,1,11,"Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan are undone! All those who were loaded with silver are cut off."
Zephaniah,1,12,"It will happen at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are settled on their dregs, who say in their heart, “Yahweh will not do good, neither will he do evil.”"
Zephaniah,1,13,"Their wealth will become a spoil, and their houses a desolation. Yes, they will build houses, but won’t inhabit them. They will plant vineyards, but won’t drink their wine."
Zephaniah,1,14,"The great day of Yahweh is near. It is near, and hurries greatly, the voice of the day of Yahweh. The mighty man cries there bitterly."
Zephaniah,1,15,"That day is a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness, 16a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements."
Zephaniah,1,17,"I will bring distress on men, that they will walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Yahweh, and their blood will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung."
Zephaniah,1,18,"Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them in the day of Yahweh’s wrath, but the whole land will be devoured by the fire of his jealousy; for he will make an end, yes, a terrible end, of all those who dwell in the land."
Zephaniah,2,1,"Gather yourselves together, yes, gather together, you nation that has no shame, 2before the appointed time when the day passes as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Yahweh comes on you, before the day of Yahweh’s anger comes on you."
Zephaniah,2,3,"Seek Yahweh, all you humble of the land, who have kept his ordinances. Seek righteousness. Seek humility. It may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yahweh’s anger. Judgment on the Philistines (Jeremiah 47:1–7)"
Zephaniah,2,4,"For Gaza will be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation. They will drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron will be rooted up."
Zephaniah,2,5,"Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Yahweh is against you, Canaan, the land of the Philistines. I will destroy you, that there will be no inhabitant."
Zephaniah,2,6,"The sea coast will be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks."
Zephaniah,2,7,"The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah. They will find pasture. In the houses of Ashkelon, they will lie down in the evening, for Yahweh, their God, will visit them, and restore them. Judgment on Moab and Ammon (Isaiah 16:1–14; Jeremiah 48:1–47)"
Zephaniah,2,8,"I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the insults of the children of Ammon, with which they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border."
Zephaniah,2,9,"Therefore as I live, says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, surely Moab will be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and salt pits, and a perpetual desolation. The remnant of my people will plunder them, and the survivors of my nation will inherit them."
Zephaniah,2,10,"This they will have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against"
Zephaniah,2,11,"Yahweh will be awesome to them, for he will famish all the gods of the land. Men will worship him, everyone from his place, even all the shores of the nations. Judgment on Cush and Assyria"
Zephaniah,2,12,"You Cushites also, you will be killed by my sword."
Zephaniah,2,13,"He will stretch out his hand against the north, destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, as dry as the wilderness."
Zephaniah,2,14,"Herds will lie down in the midst of her, all the animals of the nations. Both the pelican and the porcupine will lodge in its capitals. Their calls will echo through the windows. Desolation will be in the thresholds, for he has laid bare the cedar beams."
Zephaniah,2,15,"This is the joyous city that lived carelessly, that said in her heart, “I am, and there is none besides me.” How she has become a desolation, a place for animals to lie down in! Everyone who passes by her will hiss, and shake their fists."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, the oppressing city!"
Zephaniah,3,2,She didn’t obey the voice. She didn’t receive correction. She didn’t trust in Yahweh. She didn’t draw near to her God.
Zephaniah,3,3,Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.
Zephaniah,3,4,Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.
Zephaniah,3,5,"Yahweh, in the midst of her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light. He doesn’t fail, but the unjust know no shame. Purification of the Nations"
Zephaniah,3,6,"I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant."
Zephaniah,3,7,"I said, “Just fear me. Receive correction, so that her dwelling won’t be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her.” But they rose early and corrupted all their doings. 8“Therefore wait for me,” says Yahweh, “until the day that I rise up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation, even all my fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. A Faithful Remnant"
Zephaniah,3,9,"For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on the name of Yahweh, to serve him shoulder to shoulder."
Zephaniah,3,10,"From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my offering."
Zephaniah,3,11,"In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings, in which you have transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of you your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be haughty in my holy mountain."
Zephaniah,3,12,"But I will leave in the midst of you an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in the name of Yahweh."
Zephaniah,3,13,"The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.” Israel’s Restoration"
Zephaniah,3,14,"Sing, daughter of Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem."
Zephaniah,3,15,"Yahweh has taken away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel, Yahweh, is in the midst of you. You will not be afraid of evil any more."
Zephaniah,3,16,"In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, “Don’t be afraid, Zion. Don’t let your hands be weak.”"
Zephaniah,3,17,"Yahweh, your God, is in the midst of you, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will calm you in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing."
Zephaniah,3,18,I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you.
Zephaniah,3,19,"Behold, at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you, and I will save those who are lame, and gather those who were driven away. I will give them praise and honor, whose shame has been in all the earth."
Zephaniah,3,20,"At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says Yahweh."
Haggai,1,1,"In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai, the prophet, to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying, 2“This is what Yahweh of Armies says: These"
Haggai,1,3,"Then the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai, the prophet, saying, 4“Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled"
Haggai,1,5,Now therefore this is what Yahweh of Armies says: Consider your
Haggai,1,6,"You have sown much, and bring in little. You eat, but you don’t have enough. You drink, but you aren’t filled with drink. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm, and he who earns wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes in it.”"
Haggai,1,7,This is what Yahweh of Armies says: “Consider your ways.
Haggai,1,8,"Go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build the house. I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified,” says Yahweh. 9“You looked for much, and, behold, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why?” says Yahweh of Armies, “Because of my house that lies waste, while each of you is busy with his own house."
Haggai,1,10,"Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit."
Haggai,1,11,"I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on that which the ground brings forth, on men, on livestock, and on all the labor of the hands.” The People Obey"
Haggai,1,12,"Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Yahweh, their God, and the words of Haggai, the prophet,"
Haggai,1,13,"Then Haggai, Yahweh’s"
Haggai,1,14,"Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of Yahweh of Armies, their God, 15in the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king."
Haggai,2,1,"In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying, 2“Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 3‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn’t it in your eyes as nothing?"

Haggai,2,10,"In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying, 11“Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying, 12‘If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread,"
Haggai,2,13,"Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?” The priests"

Haggai,2,20,"The Word of Yahweh came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,"
Haggai,2,22,"I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. The horses and their riders will come down,"
Haggai,2,23,"In that day, says Yahweh of Armies, will I take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,’ says Yahweh, ‘and will make you as a signet, for I have chosen you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.”"
Zechariah,1,1,"In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying, 2“Yahweh was very displeased with your fathers."

Zechariah,1,12,"Then the angel of Yahweh replied, “O Yahweh of Armies, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these seventy years?”"
Zechariah,1,13,Yahweh answered the angel who talked with me with kind and comforting words.
Zechariah,1,14,"So the angel who talked with me said to me, “Proclaim, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh of Armies: “I am jealous for"

Zechariah,1,18,"I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four horns."
Zechariah,1,19,"I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these?” He answered me, “These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”"
Zechariah,1,20,Yahweh showed me four craftsmen.
Zechariah,1,21,"Then I asked, “What are these coming to do?” He said, “These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head; but these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.”"
Zechariah,2,1,"I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand."

Malachi,1,1,"An oracle: the word of Yahweh to Israel by Malachi. 2“I have loved you,” says Yahweh. Yet you say, “How have you loved us?” “Wasn’t Esau Jacob’s brother?” says Yahweh, “Yet I loved Jacob; 3but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation,"
Malachi,1,4,"Whereas Edom says, “We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places;” thus says Yahweh of Armies, “They shall build, but I will throw down; and men will call them ‘The Wicked Land,’ even the people against whom Yahweh"
Malachi,1,5,"Your eyes will see, and you will say, “Yahweh is great—even beyond the border of Israel!” The Polluted Offerings 6“A son honors his father, and a servant his master.

Malachi,1,8,"When you offer the blind for sacrifice, isn’t that evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, isn’t that evil? Present it now to your governor! Will he be pleased with you? Or will he accept your person?” says Yahweh of Armies. 9“Now, please entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With this, will he accept any of you?” says Yahweh of Armies. 10“Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “neither"
Malachi,1,11,"For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same, my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the nations,” says Yahweh of Armies. 12“But you profane it, in that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is polluted, and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.’"
Malachi,1,13,"You say also, ‘Behold, what a weariness it is!’ and you have sniffed at it,” says Yahweh of Armies; “and you have brought that which was taken by violence, the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this at your hand?” says Yahweh. 14“But the deceiver is cursed, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and my name is awesome among the nations.”"
Malachi,2,2,"If you will not listen, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name,” says Yahweh of Armies, “then will I send the curse on you, and I will"

Judah’s Unfaithfulness"
Malachi,2,10,Don’t we all have one father? Hasn’t one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man

Robbing God 6“For I, Yahweh, don’t change; therefore you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed."

The Book of Remembrance 13“Your words have been stout against me,” says Yahweh. “Yet you say, ‘What have we spoken against"
Malachi,3,14,"You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God;’ and ‘What profit is it that we have followed his"
Malachi,3,15,"Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.’"
Malachi,3,16,"Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened, and heard, and a book of memory was written before him, for those who feared Yahweh, and who honored his name."
Malachi,3,17,"They shall be mine,” says Yahweh of Armies, “my own possession in the day that I make, and I will"

John,1,43,"On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him,"
John,1,44,"Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter."
John,1,45,"Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote:"
John,1,46,"Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of"
John,1,47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about"
John,1,48,"Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”"
John,1,49,"Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”"
John,1,50,"Jesus answered him, “Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater"
John,1,51,"He said to him, “Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”"
John,2,1,"The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there."
John,2,2,Jesus also was
John,2,3,"When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They"
John,2,4,"Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has"
John,2,5,"His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it.”"
John,2,6,"Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews’ way of purifying, containing two or three metretes"
John,2,7,"Jesus said to them, “Fill the water pots with water.” They filled them up to the brim."
John,2,8,He said
John,2,9,"When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn’t know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom, 10and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse."
John,2,11,"This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. Jesus Cleanses the Temple (Matthew 21:12–17; Mark 11:15–19; Luke 19:45–48)"
John,2,12,"After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days."
John,2,13,"The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
John,2,14,He found in the temple
John,2,15,"He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’"

John,2,20,"The Jews therefore said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise"
John,2,21,But he spoke of the temple of his body.
John,2,22,"When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said."
John,2,23,"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name,"
John,2,24,"But Jesus didn’t trust himself to them, because he knew everyone, 25and because he didn’t need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man."
John,3,1,"Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews."
John,3,2,"The same came to him by night, and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can"
John,3,3,"Jesus answered him, “Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he can’t see the Kingdom of God.”"
John,3,4,"Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his"

John,3,8,"The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don’t know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”"
John,3,9,"Nicodemus answered him, “How can these things be?”"

John,3,17,"For God didn’t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but"

John,3,19,"This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather"

John,3,22,"After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them,"
John,3,23,"John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there."
John,3,24,For John was not yet thrown into prison.
John,3,25,There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with some Jews about purification.
John,3,26,"They came to John, and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you"

John,3,32,"What he has seen and heard, of that he"

John,3,36,"One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won’t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”"
John,4,1,"Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John 2(although Jesus himself didn’t baptize, but his disciples), 3he left Judea, and"
John,4,4,He needed to pass through Samaria.
John,4,5,"So he came to a city of Samaria, called"
John,4,6,"Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour."

John,4,12,"Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did"
John,4,13,"Jesus answered her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, 14but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”"
John,4,15,"The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I don’t get thirsty, neither come all the way"
John,4,16,"Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.”"

John,4,27,"At this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said,"

John,4,30,"They went out of the city, and were coming to him."
John,4,31,"In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”"

John,4,36,"He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together."
John,4,37,"For in this the saying is true, ‘One sows, and another reaps.’"
John,4,38,"I sent you to reap that for which you haven’t labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.” Many Samaritans Believe"
John,4,39,"From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who"
John,4,40,"So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him"
John,4,41,Many more believed because of his word.
John,4,42,"They said to the woman, “Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.” Jesus Heals the Official’s Son (Matthew 8:5–13; Luke 7:1–10)"

John,5,7,"The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up,"

John,5,19,"Jesus therefore answered them, “Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but"

John,5,30,"I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don’t seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me. Testimonies about Jesus"
John,5,32,It is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.

Acts,28,16,"When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him."
Acts,28,17,"It happened that after three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, “I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans, 18who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in"

In seeing, you will see, but will in no way perceive."
Acts,28,27,"For this people’s heart has grown callous. Their ears are dull of hearing. Their eyes they have closed. Lest they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and would turn again, and I would heal them.’ 28“Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the nations. They will also listen.”"
Acts,28,29,"When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves."
Acts,28,30,"Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who were coming to him, 31preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance."
Romans,1,1,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Good News of God, 2which he promised before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, 3concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, 4who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, 5through whom we received grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name’s sake; 6among whom you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ; 7to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Romans,1,17,"For in it is revealed God’s righteousness from faith to faith. As it is written, “But the righteous shall live by faith.” God’s Wrath against Sin"
Romans,1,18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, 19because that which is known of God is revealed in them,"

Romans,1,22,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 23and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things."
Romans,1,24,"Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves, 25who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen."
Romans,1,26,"For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function"
Romans,1,27,"Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error."
Romans,1,28,"Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting; 29being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers, 30backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful; 32who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also approve of those who practice them."

Romans,2,24,"For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” just as it is written."
Romans,2,25,"For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law,"

Romans,2,28,"For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; 29but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God."
Romans,3,1,Then what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the profit of circumcision?
Romans,3,2,Much in every way!
Romans,3,3,For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?
Romans,3,4,"May it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written, “That you might be justified in your words, and might prevail when you come into judgment.”"
Romans,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous"
Romans,3,6,May it never be! For then how will God judge the world?
Romans,3,7,For
Romans,3,8,"Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), “Let us do evil, that good may come?” Those who say so are justly condemned. There Is No One Righteous (Psalm 14:1–7; Psalm 53:1–6; Isaiah 59:1–17)"
Romans,3,9,"What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously warned both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin."
Romans,3,10,"As it is written, “There is no one righteous; no, not one."
Romans,3,11,There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks after God.
Romans,3,12,"They have all turned aside. They have together become unprofitable. There is no one who does good, no, not, so much as one.” 13“Their throat is an open tomb. With their tongues they have used deceit.” “The poison of vipers is under their lips;” 14“whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.” 15“Their feet are swift to shed blood."
Romans,3,16,Destruction and misery are in their ways.
Romans,3,17,"The way of peace, they haven’t known.” 18“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”"
Romans,3,19,"Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that"
Romans,3,20,"Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of sin. Righteousness through Faith in Christ (Philippians 3:1–11)"
Romans,3,21,"But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets; 22even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe. For there is no distinction, 23for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God; 24being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; 25whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God’s forbearance; 26to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus."
Romans,3,27,"Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith."
Romans,3,28,We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
Romans,3,29,"Or is God the God of Jews only? Isn’t he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, 30since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith."
Romans,3,31,"Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! No, we establish the law."
Romans,4,1,"What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh?"

Romans,4,6,"Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works, 7“Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered."
Romans,4,8,Blessed is the man whom the Lord will by no means charge with sin.”
Romans,4,9,"Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say that"
Romans,4,10,How then was it counted? When he was in

Romans,4,12,"He is the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision. Abraham Receives the Promise (Genesis 15:8–21)"
Romans,4,13,For the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn’t through the
Romans,4,14,"For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made"
Romans,4,15,"For the law works wrath, for where there is no law, neither is there disobedience."

Romans,4,17,"As it is written, “I have made you a father of many nations.” This is in the presence of him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things"
Romans,4,18,"Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, “So will your seed be.”"
Romans,4,19,"Without being weakened in faith, he didn’t consider his own body, already having been worn out,"
Romans,4,20,"Yet, looking to the promise of God, he didn’t waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to God, 21and"
Romans,4,22,Therefore it also was
Romans,4,23,"Now it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone, 24but for our sake also, to whom it will be accounted, who believe in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead, 25who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification."
Romans,5,1,"Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; 2through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand. We rejoice in hope of the"
Romans,5,3,"Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering works perseverance; 4and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope: 5and hope doesn’t disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us. Christ’s Sacrifice for the Ungodly (John 3:1–21)"
Romans,5,6,"For while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly."
Romans,5,7,For one will hardly die for
Romans,5,8,But God
Romans,5,9,Much more
Romans,5,10,"For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being"
Romans,5,11,"Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. Death in Adam, Life in Christ (Genesis 3:1–7)"
Romans,5,12,"Therefore, as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin; and so death"
Romans,5,13,"For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged"
Romans,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins weren’t like Adam’s disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come."
Romans,5,15,"But the free gift isn’t like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many."
Romans,5,16,"The gift is not as through one who sinned: for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the"
Romans,5,17,"For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ."
Romans,5,18,"So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of"
Romans,5,19,For as through the one man’s disobedience many were
Romans,5,20,"The law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly; 21that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."

Romans,6,2,May it never be! We who

Romans,6,11,"Thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord."

Romans,6,13,"Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as alive from"
Romans,6,14,"For sin will not have dominion over you. For you are not under law, but under grace. The Wages of Sin"
Romans,6,15,"What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be!"
Romans,6,16,"Don’t you know that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obedience, his servants you are whom"
Romans,6,17,"But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching"
Romans,6,18,"Being made free from sin, you became bondservants of"
Romans,6,19,"I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification."
Romans,6,20,"For when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness."
Romans,6,21,What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is
Romans,6,22,"But now, being made free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit"
Romans,6,23,"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans,7,1,"Or don’t you know, brothers (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over"
Romans,7,2,For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband
Romans,7,3,"So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man."
Romans,7,4,"Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to"

Romans,7,7,"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be! However, I wouldn’t have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn’t have known coveting, unless the law had said, “You shall not covet.”"
Romans,7,8,"But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart"
Romans,7,9,"I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came,"
Romans,7,10,"The commandment, which was for life, this I found to be for death; 11for sin,"
Romans,7,12,"Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good. Struggling with Sin"
Romans,7,13,"Did then that which is good become death to me? May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful."
Romans,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin."
Romans,7,15,For I don’t know what I am
Romans,7,16,"But if what I don’t desire,"
Romans,7,17,"So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells"
Romans,7,18,"For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with"
Romans,7,19,"For the good which I desire, I don’t do; but the evil"
Romans,7,20,"But if what I don’t desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me."
Romans,7,21,"I find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present."
Romans,7,22,"For I delight in God’s law after the inward man, 23but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,"
Romans,7,24,What a wretched man
Romans,7,25,"I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord! So then with the mind, I myself serve God’s law, but with the flesh, the sin’s law."
Romans,8,1,"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who don’t walk according"
Romans,8,2,For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free
Romans,8,3,"For what the law couldn’t do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh; 4that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
Romans,8,5,"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live"
Romans,8,6,"For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace; 7because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God; for it is not subject to"

Romans,8,18,For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory
Romans,8,19,For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of
Romans,8,20,"For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in hope 21that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay"
Romans,8,22,For we know that the whole creation groans and
Romans,8,23,"Not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body."
Romans,8,24,"For we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees?"
Romans,8,25,"But if we hope for that which we don’t see, we wait for it with patience."
Romans,8,26,"In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don’t know how to pray as we ought."
Romans,8,27,"He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit’s mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God. God Works in All Things (Ephesians 1:3–14)"
Romans,8,28,"We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, to those who are called"
Romans,8,29,"For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image"
Romans,8,30,"Whom he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified. Whom he justified, those he also glorified."
Romans,8,31,"What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?"
Romans,8,32,"He who didn’t spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all"
Romans,8,33,Who could bring a charge against God’s chosen ones? It is God who justifies.
Romans,8,34,"Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. More than Conquerors (Psalm 44:1–26)"
Romans,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
Romans,8,36,"Even as it is written, “For your sake we are killed all day long. We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.”"
Romans,8,37,"No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us."
Romans,8,38,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, 39nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

Romans,9,3,"For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers’ sake, my relatives according to the flesh, 4who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises; 5of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever.

Romans,9,15,"For he said to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”"
Romans,9,16,"So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy."
Romans,9,17,"For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my"
Romans,9,18,"So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires."
Romans,9,19,"You will say then to me, “Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?”"
Romans,9,20,"But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, “Why did you"
Romans,9,21,"Or hasn’t the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part"
Romans,9,22,"What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction, 23and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory, 24us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?"
Romans,9,25,"As he says also in Hosea, “I will call them ‘my people,’ which were not my people; and her ‘beloved,’ who was not beloved.” 26“It will be that in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ There they will be called ‘children of the living God.’”"
Romans,9,27,"Isaiah cries concerning Israel, “If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant who will be saved; 28for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth.”"
Romans,9,29,"As Isaiah has said before, “Unless the Lord of Armies had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and would have been made like Gomorrah.” Israel’s Unbelief"
Romans,9,30,"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn’t follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith; 31but Israel, following after a law of"
Romans,9,32,"Why? Because they didn’t seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone; 33even as it is written, “Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense; and no one who believes in him will be disappointed.”"
Romans,10,1,"Brothers, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved."
Romans,10,2,For I testify
Romans,10,3,"For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn’t subject themselves"
Romans,10,4,For Christ is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
Romans,10,5,"For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, “The one who does them will live by them.”"
Romans,10,6,"But the righteousness which is of faith says this, “Don’t say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ (that is, to bring Christ down); 7or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ (that is, to bring Christ up from"
Romans,10,8,"But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;” that is, the word of faith, which we preach: 9that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and"
Romans,10,10,"For with the heart, one"
Romans,10,11,For the Scripture
Romans,10,12,For there is no distinction between Jew
Romans,10,13,"For, “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.”"
Romans,10,14,How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom
Romans,10,15,"And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!”"
Romans,10,16,"But they didn’t all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”"
Romans,10,17,"So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."
Romans,10,18,"But I say, didn’t they hear? Yes, most certainly, “Their sound went out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.”"
Romans,10,19,"But I ask, didn’t Israel know? First Moses says, “I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry.”"
Romans,10,20,"Isaiah is very bold, and says, “I was found by those who didn’t seek me. I was revealed to those who didn’t ask for me.”"
Romans,10,21,"But as to Israel he says, “All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”"
Romans,11,1,"I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of"
Romans,11,2,"God didn’t reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel: 3“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.”"
Romans,11,4,"But how does God answer him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not"
Romans,11,5,Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the
Romans,11,6,"And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work."
Romans,11,7,"What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn’t obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened."
Romans,11,8,"According as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.”"
Romans,11,9,"David says, “Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution to them."
Romans,11,10,"Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. Bow down their back always.” The Ingrafting of the Gentiles"
Romans,11,11,"I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come"
Romans,11,12,"Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss"
Romans,11,13,"For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry; 14if by any means I may provoke to jealousy"
Romans,11,15,For if the rejection of them is the reconciling
Romans,11,16,"If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches."
Romans,11,17,"But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree; 18don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you."
Romans,11,19,"You will say then, “Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.”"
Romans,11,20,"True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don’t be conceited, but fear; 21for if God didn’t"
Romans,11,22,"See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise"
Romans,11,23,"They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God"
Romans,11,24,"For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? All Israel Will Be Saved"
Romans,11,25,"For I don’t desire you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you won’t be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, 26and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written, “There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob."
Romans,11,27,"This is my covenant to them, when I will take away their sins.”"
Romans,11,28,"Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are"
Romans,11,29,For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
Romans,11,30,"For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience, 31even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy."
Romans,11,32,"For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all. A Hymn of Praise (Isaiah 40:9–31)"
Romans,11,33,"Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out! 34“For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has"
Romans,11,36,"For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen."
Romans,12,1,"Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,"
Romans,12,2,"Don’t be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God."
Romans,12,3,"For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each"
Romans,12,4,"For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don’t have the same function, 5so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members"
Romans,12,6,"Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith; 7or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching; 8or he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. Love, Zeal, Hope, Hospitality (John 13:31–35; 1 John 3:11–24)"
Romans,12,9,Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.
Romans,12,10,In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another; 11not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 12rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer; 13contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.

Romans,13,7,Give therefore to everyone what you owe: taxes to whom taxes are due; customs to whom customs; respect to whom respect; honor to whom honor. Love Fulfills the Law (Leviticus 19:9–18)
Romans,13,8,"Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law."
Romans,13,9,"For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not give false testimony,” “You shall not covet,” and whatever other commandments there"
Romans,13,10,Love doesn’t harm a neighbor. Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law. The Day Is Near
Romans,13,11,"Do this, knowing the time, that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation is now"
Romans,13,12,"The night is far gone, and the day is near. Let’s therefore"
Romans,13,13,"Let us walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and not in strife and"

Romans,14,10,"But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ."
Romans,14,11,"For it is written, “‘As I live,’ says the Lord, ‘to me every knee will bow. Every tongue will confess to God.’”"
Romans,14,12,So then each one of us will give account of himself to God. The Law of Love (Ezekiel 14:1–11; 1 Corinthians 8:1–13)

1 Corinthians,3,15,"If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire. God’s Temple and God’s Wisdom (Romans 12:1–8; 1 Corinthians 6:18–20)"
1 Corinthians,3,16,"Don’t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God’s Spirit lives in you?"
1 Corinthians,3,17,"If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are."
1 Corinthians,3,18,"Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise."
1 Corinthians,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their"
1 Corinthians,3,20,"And again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”"
1 Corinthians,3,21,"Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours, 22whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours, 23and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s."
1 Corinthians,4,1,"So let a man think of us as Christ’s servants, and stewards of God’s mysteries."
1 Corinthians,4,2,"Here, moreover, it is"
1 Corinthians,4,3,But with me it is a very small thing that I should be
1 Corinthians,4,4,For I know nothing against
1 Corinthians,4,5,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each man will get his praise from God."
1 Corinthians,4,6,"Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up"
1 Corinthians,4,7,"For who makes you different? And what do you have that you didn’t receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?"
1 Corinthians,4,8,"You are already filled. You have already become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I"
1 Corinthians,4,9,"For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to"
1 Corinthians,4,10,"We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are"
1 Corinthians,4,11,"Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are"
1 Corinthians,4,12,"We toil, working with our own hands. When"
1 Corinthians,4,13,"Being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now. Paul’s Fatherly Warning"
1 Corinthians,4,14,"I don’t write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children."
1 Corinthians,4,15,"For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, I became your father"
1 Corinthians,4,16,"I beg you therefore, be imitators of me."
1 Corinthians,4,17,"Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which"
1 Corinthians,4,18,"Now some are puffed up, as though I"
1 Corinthians,4,19,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the"
1 Corinthians,4,20,"For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in"
1 Corinthians,4,21,"What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"
1 Corinthians,5,1,"It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not"
1 Corinthians,5,2,"You are puffed up, and didn’t rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you."
1 Corinthians,5,3,"For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were"
1 Corinthians,5,4,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 5are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
1 Corinthians,5,6,Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?
1 Corinthians,5,7,"Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover,"
1 Corinthians,5,8,"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Expel the Immoral Brother"
1 Corinthians,5,9,"I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners; 10yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would"
1 Corinthians,5,11,"But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an"
1 Corinthians,5,12,For what have I to do with also judging those who
1 Corinthians,5,13,"But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.”"
1 Corinthians,6,1,"Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not"
1 Corinthians,6,2,Don’t you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by
1 Corinthians,6,3,Don’t you know that we will judge angels? How
1 Corinthians,6,4,"If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do"
1 Corinthians,6,5,I say this to move you to shame. Isn’t
1 Corinthians,6,6,"But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!"
1 Corinthians,6,7,"Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not"
1 Corinthians,6,8,"No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers. Members of Christ"
1 Corinthians,6,9,"Or don’t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don’t be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals, 10nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of God."
1 Corinthians,6,11,"Such were some of you, but you were washed. But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God. 12“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are expedient. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be brought under the power of anything. 13“Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods,” but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord;"
1 Corinthians,6,14,"Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power."
1 Corinthians,6,15,"Don’t you know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ,"
1 Corinthians,6,16,Or don’t you know that he who is joined
1 Corinthians,6,17,But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. The Temple of the Holy Spirit (Romans 12:1–8; 1 Corinthians 3:16–23)
1 Corinthians,6,18,"Flee sexual immorality! “Every sin that a man does is outside the body,” but he who commits sexual"
1 Corinthians,6,19,"Or don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God? You are not your own, 20for you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s."
1 Corinthians,7,1,Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman.
1 Corinthians,7,2,"But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her"
1 Corinthians,7,3,"Let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also the wife"
1 Corinthians,7,4,"The wife doesn’t have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also"
1 Corinthians,7,5,"Don’t deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together"
1 Corinthians,7,6,But this I say by way of
1 Corinthians,7,7,"Yet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind."
1 Corinthians,7,8,"But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am."
1 Corinthians,7,9,"But if they don’t have self-control, let them marry. For it’s better to marry than to burn."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"But to the married I command—not I, but the Lord—that the wife not leave her husband 11(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife."
1 Corinthians,7,12,"But to the rest I—not the Lord—say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to"
1 Corinthians,7,13,"The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content"
1 Corinthians,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but"
1 Corinthians,7,15,"Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is"
1 Corinthians,7,16,"For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? Live Your Calling"
1 Corinthians,7,17,"Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command"
1 Corinthians,7,18,Was anyone called having been circumcised? Let him not become

1 Corinthians,7,21,"Were you called being a bondservant? Don’t let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to"
1 Corinthians,7,22,For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord’s free man.

1 Corinthians,7,25,"Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who"
1 Corinthians,7,26,"I think that it is good therefore, because of the"
1 Corinthians,7,27,Are you bound to a wife? Don’t seek
1 Corinthians,7,28,"But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you."
1 Corinthians,7,29,"But I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none; 30and those who weep, as though they didn’t weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn’t rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn’t possess; 31and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away."
1 Corinthians,7,32,"But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; 33but he who is married is concerned about the things of the"
1 Corinthians,7,34,"There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit."
1 Corinthians,7,35,"This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower"
1 Corinthians,7,37,"But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep"
1 Corinthians,7,38,"So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn’t give her in marriage does better."
1 Corinthians,7,39,"A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be"
1 Corinthians,7,40,"But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God’s Spirit."
1 Corinthians,8,1,"Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up,"
1 Corinthians,8,2,"But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to"
1 Corinthians,8,3,"But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him."
1 Corinthians,8,4,"Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the"
1 Corinthians,8,5,"For though there are things that are called “gods,” whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many “gods” and many “lords;” 6yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him."
1 Corinthians,8,7,"However, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as"
1 Corinthians,8,8,But food will not commend
1 Corinthians,8,9,But be

1 Corinthians,8,11,"And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes,"
1 Corinthians,8,12,"Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their"
1 Corinthians,8,13,"Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don’t cause my brother to stumble."
1 Corinthians,9,1,"Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven’t I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Aren’t you my work in the"
1 Corinthians,9,2,"If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,9,3,My defense to those who examine me is this.
1 Corinthians,9,4,Have we no right to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians,9,5,"Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the"
1 Corinthians,9,6,Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work?
1 Corinthians,9,7,"What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn’t eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and doesn’t drink from the flock’s milk?"
1 Corinthians,9,8,Do I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or doesn’t the law also say the same thing?
1 Corinthians,9,9,"For it is written in the law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.” Is it for the oxen that God cares, 10or does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of"
1 Corinthians,9,11,"If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?"
1 Corinthians,9,12,"If others partake of this right over you, don’t we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but"
1 Corinthians,9,13,"Don’t you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the"
1 Corinthians,9,14,Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News.
1 Corinthians,9,15,"But I have used none of these things, and I don’t write these things that it may be done so in my"
1 Corinthians,9,16,"For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I don’t"
1 Corinthians,9,17,"For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I"
1 Corinthians,9,18,"What then is my reward? That, when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News. Paul the Servant to All"
1 Corinthians,9,19,"For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more."
1 Corinthians,9,20,"To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law; 21to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are"
1 Corinthians,9,22,"To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things"
1 Corinthians,9,23,"Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it. Run Your Race to Win"
1 Corinthians,9,24,"Don’t you know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, that"
1 Corinthians,9,25,Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it
1 Corinthians,9,26,"I therefore run like that, as not uncertainly. I fight like that, as not beating the air, 27but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected."
1 Corinthians,10,1,"Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; 2and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 3and all ate the same spiritual food; 4and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed"
1 Corinthians,10,5,"However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness."
1 Corinthians,10,6,"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also"
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Neither be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and"
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and"

1 Corinthians,10,14,"Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak as to wise men. Judge what I say.
1 Corinthians,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, isn’t it a sharing of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, isn’t it a"
1 Corinthians,10,17,"Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body;"
1 Corinthians,10,18,Consider Israel according to the flesh. Don’t those who

1 Corinthians,10,20,"But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don’t desire that you would have fellowship with demons."
1 Corinthians,10,21,You can’t both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can’t both partake of the table
1 Corinthians,10,22,"Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All to God’s Glory (1 Peter 4:1–11) 23“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are profitable. “All things are lawful for me,” but not"

1 Corinthians,10,25,"Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience, 26for “the earth is the Lord’s, and"
1 Corinthians,10,27,"But if one of those who don’t believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go,"
1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if anyone says to you, “This was offered to idols,” don’t eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake"
1 Corinthians,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not your own, but"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
1 Corinthians,10,32,"Give no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God; 33even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved."
1 Corinthians,11,1,"Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,2,"Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as"

1 Corinthians,11,17,"But in giving you this command, I don’t praise you, that you come together not for the better but for"
1 Corinthians,11,18,"For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among"
1 Corinthians,11,19,"For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved"
1 Corinthians,11,20,"When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord’s"
1 Corinthians,11,21,"For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and"
1 Corinthians,11,22,"What, don’t you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God’s assembly, and put them to shame who don’t have? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don’t praise you."
1 Corinthians,11,23,"For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in"
1 Corinthians,11,24,"When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “Take, eat."
1 Corinthians,11,25,"In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you"
1 Corinthians,11,26,"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes."
1 Corinthians,11,27,Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be
1 Corinthians,11,28,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of"
1 Corinthians,11,29,For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks
1 Corinthians,11,30,For this cause many among you are weak
1 Corinthians,11,31,"For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn’t be judged."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don’t want you to be ignorant."
1 Corinthians,12,2,You know that when you
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God’s Spirit says, “Jesus is accursed.” No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” but by the Holy Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"There are various kinds of service, and the"
1 Corinthians,12,6,"There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all."
1 Corinthians,12,7,But
1 Corinthians,12,8,"For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; 9to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit; 10and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different"
1 Corinthians,12,11,"But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires. The Body of Christ"
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are"
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot would say, “Because I’m not the hand, I’m"
1 Corinthians,12,16,"If the ear would say, “Because I’m not"

1 Corinthians,12,21,"The eye can’t tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need for you.”"
1 Corinthians,12,22,"No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary."
1 Corinthians,12,23,"Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety; 24whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part, 25that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one"
1 Corinthians,12,26,"When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. The Greater Gifts"
1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle"
1 Corinthians,12,29,Are all apostles?
1 Corinthians,12,30,Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak
1 Corinthians,12,31,"But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you."
1 Corinthians,13,1,"If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but don’t have love, I have become sounding"
1 Corinthians,13,2,"If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge;"
1 Corinthians,13,3,"If I dole out all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don’t have love, it profits me nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Love is patient and is kind; love doesn’t envy. Love doesn’t brag, is not proud, 5doesn’t behave itself inappropriately, doesn’t seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil; 6doesn’t rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; 7bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."

1 Corinthians,14,2,"For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the"

1 Corinthians,14,4,"He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies"
1 Corinthians,14,5,"Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy. For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up."

1 Corinthians,14,12,"So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly."
1 Corinthians,14,13,Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians,14,14,For if I pray in

1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brothers, don’t be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature."
1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the law it is written, “By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people."

1 Corinthians,14,25,"And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed. Orderly Worship"
1 Corinthians,14,26,"What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other"

1 Corinthians,14,35,"If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own"
1 Corinthians,14,36,What? Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?

1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don’t forbid speaking with other languages."
1 Corinthians,14,40,Let all things be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"Now I declare to you, brothers, the Good News which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand, 2by which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,"
1 Corinthians,15,6,Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers

1 Corinthians,15,11,"Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed. The Resurrection of the Dead"
1 Corinthians,15,12,"Now if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ"
1 Corinthians,15,14,"If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,15,"Yes, we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ,"
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead aren’t raised, neither"
1 Corinthians,15,17,"If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins."
1 Corinthians,15,18,Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable. The Order of Resurrection"
1 Corinthians,15,20,But now Christ has been raised from the dead. He became the first fruits of those who are asleep.
1 Corinthians,15,21,"For since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man."
1 Corinthians,15,22,For as in Adam all
1 Corinthians,15,23,"But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then"
1 Corinthians,15,24,"Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to"

1 Corinthians,15,28,"When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren’t raised at all, why then"
1 Corinthians,15,30,Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?
1 Corinthians,15,31,"I affirm, by the"

1 Corinthians,15,33,Don’t be deceived! “Evil companionships corrupt good morals.”
1 Corinthians,15,34,"Wake up righteously, and don’t sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame. The Resurrection Body"
1 Corinthians,15,35,"But someone will say, “How are the dead raised?” and, “With what kind of body do they come?”"
1 Corinthians,15,36,"You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies."
1 Corinthians,15,37,"That which you sow,"
1 Corinthians,15,38,But
1 Corinthians,15,39,"All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of"
1 Corinthians,15,40,"There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from"
1 Corinthians,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory."
1 Corinthians,15,42,So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.
1 Corinthians,15,43,It is
1 Corinthians,15,44,It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body.
1 Corinthians,15,45,"So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul.” The last Adam became a life-giving"
1 Corinthians,15,46,"However that which is spiritual isn’t first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual."
1 Corinthians,15,47,"The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,48,"As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they"
1 Corinthians,15,49,"As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let’s also bear the image of the heavenly. Where, O Death, Is Your Victory? (Hosea 13:9–14)"
1 Corinthians,15,50,"Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can’t inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does"

Paul’s Change of Plans"
2 Corinthians,1,12,"For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly"
2 Corinthians,1,13,"For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end; 14as also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus."

2 Corinthians,3,1,"Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation"
2 Corinthians,3,2,"You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men; 3being revealed that you are a letter of Christ, served by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh."
2 Corinthians,3,4,"Such confidence we have through Christ toward God; 5not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God; 6who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. The Glory of the New Covenant (Exodus 34:10–35)"
2 Corinthians,3,7,"But if the service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which was passing away:"
2 Corinthians,3,9,"For if the service of condemnation has glory,"
2 Corinthians,3,10,For most certainly that which has been

Treasure in Jars of Clay (Romans 6:1–14)"
2 Corinthians,4,7,"But we have this treasure in clay vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God,"

2 Corinthians,4,11,"For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal"
2 Corinthians,4,12,"So then death works in us, but life in you."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, “I believed, and therefore I spoke.” We also believe, and therefore also we speak; 14knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus"
2 Corinthians,4,15,"For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God."
2 Corinthians,4,16,"Therefore we don’t faint, but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed"
2 Corinthians,4,17,"For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory; 18while we don’t look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"For we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house"
2 Corinthians,5,2,"For most certainly in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven; 3if so be that being clothed we will not be found"

2 Corinthians,5,11,"Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope"
2 Corinthians,5,12,"For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you may have something to answer"
2 Corinthians,5,13,"For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God. Or if"
2 Corinthians,5,14,"For the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that"
2 Corinthians,5,15,"He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again."

2 Corinthians,5,18,"But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation; 19namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beg"

2 Corinthians,6,11,"Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged."
2 Corinthians,6,12,"You are not restricted by us, but you"
2 Corinthians,6,13,"Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide. Do Not Be Unequally Yoked"
2 Corinthians,6,14,"Don’t be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or"

2 Corinthians,7,1,"Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
2 Corinthians,7,2,Open your hearts to us. We wronged no one. We corrupted no one. We took advantage of no one.
2 Corinthians,7,3,"I say this not to condemn you, for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live"
2 Corinthians,7,4,Great is my boldness of speech toward you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction.
2 Corinthians,7,5,"For even when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every"
2 Corinthians,7,6,"Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus; 7and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so"
2 Corinthians,7,8,"For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it, though I did"
2 Corinthians,7,9,"I now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly"
2 Corinthians,7,10,"For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation,"
2 Corinthians,7,11,"For behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure"

Ephesians,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ; 4even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love; 5having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire, 6to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely bestowed favor on us in the Beloved, 7in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, 8which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 9making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him 10to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him; 11in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will; 12to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ: 13in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation—in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 14who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of his glory. Spiritual Wisdom (1 Corinthians 2:6–16)"
Ephesians,1,15,"For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the saints, 16don’t cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, 17that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; 18having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, 19and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might 20which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places, 21far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which"
Ephesians,1,22,"He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly, 23which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all."
Ephesians,2,1,"You were made alive when you were dead in transgressions and sins, 2in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience; 3among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest."
Ephesians,2,4,"But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us, 5even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), 6and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus; 8for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9not"

Ephesians,2,19,"So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God, 20being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone; 21in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord; 22in whom you also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit."
Ephesians,3,1,"For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles, 2if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you; 3how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words, 4by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ; 5which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; 6that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News, 7of which I was made a servant, according to"
Ephesians,3,8,"To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 9and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ; 10to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places, 11according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord; 12in whom we"
Ephesians,3,13,"Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory. Paul’s Prayer for the Ephesians"
Ephesians,3,14,"For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, 16that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man; 17that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 19and to know Christ’s love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God."
Ephesians,3,20,"Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, 21to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen."

Ephesians,4,4,"There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you also were called in one hope of your calling; 5one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all."
Ephesians,4,7,But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Ephesians,4,8,"Therefore he says, “When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.”"
Ephesians,4,9,"Now this, “He ascended,” what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?"
Ephesians,4,10,"He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all"
Ephesians,4,11,"He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, shepherds and teachers; 12for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the body of Christ; 13until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; 14that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error; 15but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, Christ; 16from whom all the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the working in measure of each individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love. New Life in Christ (Colossians 3:1–17)"
Ephesians,4,17,"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind, 18being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts; 19who having"
Ephesians,4,20,"But you did not learn Christ that way; 21if indeed you heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus: 22that you put away, as concerning your former way of life, the old man, that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit; 23and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 24and put on the new man, who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth."

Ephesians,5,18,"Don’t be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit, 19speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 20giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father; Wives and Husbands (Song of Solomon 1:1–17; 1 Peter 3:1–7) 21subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ."
Ephesians,5,22,"Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord."
Ephesians,5,23,"For the husband is the head of the wife,"
Ephesians,5,24,"But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything."
Ephesians,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it; 26that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, 27that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be"
Ephesians,5,28,Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies.
Ephesians,5,29,"For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly; 30because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones. 31“For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his"

Paul’s Trials Advance the Gospel (James 1:2–12)"
Philippians,1,12,"Now I desire to have you know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News; 13so that it became evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ; 14and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident"

Philippians,1,29,"Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf, 30having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me."
Philippians,2,1,"If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion, 2make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind; 3doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself; 4each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others. The Mind of Christ (Isaiah 52:13–15)"
Philippians,2,5,"Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus, 6who, existing in the form of God, didn’t consider equality with God a thing to be grasped, 7but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,"

Philippians,3,1,"Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not tiresome, but for you it is safe."
Philippians,3,2,"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision."
Philippians,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh; 4though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I yet more: 5circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee; 6concerning zeal, persecuting the assembly; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless."
Philippians,3,7,"However, what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ."
Philippians,3,8,"Yes most certainly, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them nothing but refuse, that I may gain Christ 9and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith; 10that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death; 11if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.

Philippians,3,17,"Brothers, be imitators together of me, and note those who walk this way, even as you have us for"
Philippians,3,18,"For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ, 19whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is"
Philippians,3,20,"For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; 21who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself."
Philippians,4,1,"Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved."
Philippians,4,2,"I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord."

1 Timothy,2,14,"Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience; 15but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety."
1 Timothy,3,1,"This is a faithful saying: if a man seeks the office of an overseer, he desires a good work."
1 Timothy,3,2,"The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching; 3not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous; 4one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence; 5(but if a man doesn’t know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the assembly of God?) 6not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the"

1 Timothy,3,14,"These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly; 15but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,"Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great: God was revealed in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and received up in glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,"But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, 2through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron; 3forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods"

1 Timothy,4,6,"If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in"
1 Timothy,4,7,But refuse profane and old
1 Timothy,4,8,"For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness"
1 Timothy,4,9,This
1 Timothy,4,10,"For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe."
1 Timothy,4,11,Command and teach these things.
1 Timothy,4,12,Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those

1 Timothy,4,14,"Don’t neglect the gift that is in you, which was"
1 Timothy,4,15,Be diligent in these things.
1 Timothy,4,16,"Pay attention to yourself, and to your teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you."
1 Timothy,5,1,"Don’t rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers; 2the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity. Honoring True Widows (Ruth 1:1–5)"
1 Timothy,5,3,Honor widows who are widows indeed.
1 Timothy,5,4,"But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to repay their parents, for this is acceptable in the"
1 Timothy,5,5,"Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues"
1 Timothy,5,6,But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.
1 Timothy,5,7,"Also command these things, that they may be without reproach."
1 Timothy,5,8,"But if anyone doesn’t provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever."
1 Timothy,5,9,"Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man, 10being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every"
1 Timothy,5,11,"But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire"
1 Timothy,5,13,"Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies,"
1 Timothy,5,14,"I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children,"
1 Timothy,5,15,For already some have turned
1 Timothy,5,16,"If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don’t let the assembly be burdened; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed. Honoring Elders"

1 Timothy,5,21,"I command you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these"
1 Timothy,5,22,"Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other men’s sins. Keep yourself pure."
1 Timothy,5,23,"Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities."
1 Timothy,5,24,"Some men’s sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later."
1 Timothy,5,25,"In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can’t be hidden."
1 Timothy,6,1,"Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that"
1 Timothy,6,2,"Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things. Reject False Doctrines"
1 Timothy,6,3,"If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and doesn’t consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, 4he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, insulting, evil suspicions, 5constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such. Godliness with Contentment"
1 Timothy,6,6,But godliness with contentment is great gain.
1 Timothy,6,7,"For we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly"
1 Timothy,6,8,"But having food and clothing, we will be content with that."
1 Timothy,6,9,"But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such"
1 Timothy,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows. Fight the Good Fight"
1 Timothy,6,11,"But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love,"
1 Timothy,6,12,Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold of the eternal life to which you were
1 Timothy,6,13,"I command you before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession, 14that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; 15which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; 16who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen. A Charge to the Rich (Proverbs 23:1–5; James 5:1–6)"
1 Timothy,6,17,"Charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on the living God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy; 18that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate; 19laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life. Guard the Faith"
1 Timothy,6,20,"Timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called; 21which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen."
2 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, 2to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Faithfulness under Persecution (Matthew 10:16–25)"
2 Timothy,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day 4longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy; 5having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also."
2 Timothy,1,6,"For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying"
2 Timothy,1,7,"For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control."
2 Timothy,1,8,"Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, 9who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, 10but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus,"
2 Timothy,1,11,"For this, I"
2 Timothy,1,12,"For this cause I also suffer these things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day. Holding to Sound Teaching"
2 Timothy,1,13,"Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ"
2 Timothy,1,14,"That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us."
2 Timothy,1,15,"This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and"
2 Timothy,1,16,"May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, 17but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me 18(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well."
2 Timothy,2,1,"You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,2,"The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to"
2 Timothy,2,3,"You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,4,"No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier."

2 Timothy,2,11,"This saying is faithful: “For if we died with him, we will also live with him."
2 Timothy,2,12,"If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us."
2 Timothy,2,13,"If we are faithless, he remains faithful. He can’t deny himself.” The Lord’s Approved Workman"

2 Timothy,2,20,"Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay."
2 Timothy,2,21,"If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work."

2 Timothy,2,24,"The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient, 25in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, 26and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will."
2 Timothy,3,1,"But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come."
2 Timothy,3,2,"For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good, 4traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; 5holding a form of godliness, but"

Titus,1,1,"Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, 2in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began; 3but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior; 4to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. Appointing Elders on Crete (1 Timothy 3:1–7; 1 Peter 5:1–4)"
Titus,1,5,"I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you; 6if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children"
Titus,1,7,"For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain; 8but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled; 9holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him. Correcting False Teachers (1 Timothy 1:3–11)"

Titus,1,16,"They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work."
Titus,2,1,"But say the things which fit sound doctrine, 2that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience: 3and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good; 4that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 5to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed."
Titus,2,6,"Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded; 7in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, 8and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us."
Titus,2,9,"Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting; 10not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things. God’s Grace Brings Salvation"
Titus,2,11,"For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 12instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world; 13looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ; 14who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works."
Titus,2,15,Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.

Hebrews,1,1,"God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, 2has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things,"
Hebrews,1,3,"His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself made purification for our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; 4having become so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have."
Hebrews,1,5,"For to which of the angels did he say at any time, “You are my Son. Today have I become your father?” and again, “I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son?”"
Hebrews,1,6,"Again, when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says, “Let all the angels of God worship him.”"
Hebrews,1,7,"Of the angels he says, “Who makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire.”"
Hebrews,1,8,"But of the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom."
Hebrews,1,9,"You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.”"

Hebrews,2,6,"But one has somewhere testified, saying, “What is man, that you think of him? Or the son of man, that you care for him?"
Hebrews,2,7,You made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor.
Hebrews,2,8,"You have put all things in subjection under his feet.” For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we don’t see all things subjected to him, yet."
Hebrews,2,9,"But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone."

Hebrews,2,14,"Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in the same way partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, 15and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to"
Hebrews,2,16,"For most certainly, he doesn’t give help to angels, but he gives help to the seed of Abraham."

Hebrews,2,18,"For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted."
Hebrews,3,1,"Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus; 2who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house."

Hebrews,3,5,"Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken, 6but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end. Do Not Harden Your Hearts (Psalm 95:1–11)"
Hebrews,3,7,"Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, “Today if you will hear his voice, 8don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness, 9where your fathers tested me by proving me, and saw my works for forty years."
Hebrews,3,10,"Therefore I was displeased with that generation, and said, ‘They always err in their heart, but they didn’t know my ways;’ 11as I swore in my wrath, ‘They will not enter into my rest.’” The Peril of Unbelief"

Hebrews,4,2,"For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn’t profit them, because it wasn’t mixed with faith by those who heard."
Hebrews,4,3,"For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, “As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest;” although the works were finished from the foundation of the world."
Hebrews,4,4,"For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, “God rested on the seventh day from all his"
Hebrews,4,6,"Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience, 7he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said), “Today if you will hear his voice, don’t harden your hearts.”"
Hebrews,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day."
Hebrews,4,9,There

Hebrews,4,13,"There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
Hebrews,4,14,"Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us"
Hebrews,4,15,For we don’t have a high priest who can’t be touched with the feeling
Hebrews,4,16,"Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need."
Hebrews,5,1,"For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God,"
Hebrews,5,2,The high priest can deal gently with those who are
Hebrews,5,3,"Because of this, he"
Hebrews,5,4,"Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was."
Hebrews,5,5,"So also Christ didn’t glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him, “You are my Son. Today I have become your father.”"
Hebrews,5,6,"As he says also in another place, “You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.”"
Hebrews,5,7,"He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear, 8though he was"
Hebrews,5,9,"Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation, 10named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. Milk and Solid Food (1 Corinthians 3:1–9)"
Hebrews,5,11,"About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of"
Hebrews,5,12,"For although by this time you should be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not"
Hebrews,5,13,"For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is"
Hebrews,5,14,"But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil."
Hebrews,6,1,"Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to perfection—not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God, 2of the teaching of baptisms,"
Hebrews,6,3,"This will we do, if God"
Hebrews,6,4,"For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit, 5and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, 6and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the"
Hebrews,6,7,"For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it, and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God; 8but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned."
Hebrews,6,9,"But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even"

Hebrews,6,11,"We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end, 12that you won’t be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises. God’s Unchangeable Promise"
Hebrews,6,13,"For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by"
Hebrews,6,15,"Thus, having"
Hebrews,6,16,"For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every"
Hebrews,6,17,"In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath; 18that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement,"
Hebrews,6,19,"This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil; 20where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,7,1,"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace; 3without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually."
Hebrews,7,4,"Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of"
Hebrews,7,5,"They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of Abraham, 6but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes"
Hebrews,7,7,But without any dispute the lesser is
Hebrews,7,8,"Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it"
Hebrews,7,9,"We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes, 10for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him. A Superior Priesthood"
Hebrews,7,11,"Now if there were perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and"
Hebrews,7,12,"For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a"
Hebrews,7,13,"For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from"
Hebrews,7,14,"For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about"
Hebrews,7,15,"This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest, 16who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life: 17for it is testified, “You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.”"
Hebrews,7,18,"For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness 19(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near"
Hebrews,7,20,"Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath 21(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with an oath by him that says of him, “The Lord swore and will not change his mind, ‘You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.’”"
Hebrews,7,22,"By so much, Jesus has become the collateral of a better covenant."
Hebrews,7,23,"Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death."
Hebrews,7,24,But
Hebrews,7,25,"Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"For such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; 27who doesn’t need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all, when he offered up"
Hebrews,7,28,"For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, 2a servant of the sanctuary, and"
Hebrews,8,3,For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.
Hebrews,8,4,"For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law; 5who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, “See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.” The New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:26–40)"
Hebrews,8,6,"But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second."
Hebrews,8,8,"For finding fault with them, he said, “Behold, the days come,” says the Lord, “that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; 9not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they didn’t continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them,” says the Lord. 10“For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel. After those days,” says the Lord; “I will put my laws into their mind, I will also write them on their heart. I will be their God, and they will be my people."
Hebrews,8,11,"They will not teach every man his fellow citizen, and every man his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for all will know me, from their least to their greatest."
Hebrews,8,12,For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness. I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more.”
Hebrews,8,13,"In that he says, “A new covenant,” he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away."
Hebrews,9,1,"Now indeed even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary."
Hebrews,9,2,"For a tabernacle was prepared. In the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the show bread; which"
Hebrews,9,3,"After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies, 4having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant; 5and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we can’t speak now in detail."
Hebrews,9,6,"Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services, 7but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without"
Hebrews,9,8,"The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn’t yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing; 9which is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshipper perfect; 10being only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation. Redemption through His Blood"
Hebrews,9,11,"But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation, 12nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having"
Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh: 14how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
Hebrews,9,15,"For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive"
Hebrews,9,16,"For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity"
Hebrews,9,17,"For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in"
Hebrews,9,18,Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without
Hebrews,9,19,"For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, 20saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which"
Hebrews,9,21,Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry
Hebrews,9,22,"According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission."
Hebrews,9,23,It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with
Hebrews,9,24,"For Christ hasn’t entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; 25nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own, 26or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put"
Hebrews,9,27,"Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment, 28so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation."
Hebrews,10,1,"For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with"
Hebrews,10,2,"Or else wouldn’t they have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once cleansed,"
Hebrews,10,3,But in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of
Hebrews,10,4,For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, “Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire, but you prepared a body for me;"
Hebrews,10,6,You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
Hebrews,10,7,"Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me) to do your will, O God.’”"
Hebrews,10,8,"Previously saying, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn’t desire, neither had pleasure in them” (those which are offered according to the law), 9then he has said, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He takes away the first, that he may establish the second, 10by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."
Hebrews,10,11,"Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins, 12but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right"
Hebrews,10,14,For by
Hebrews,10,15,"The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying, 16“This is the covenant that I will make with them: ‘After those days,’ says the Lord, ‘I will put my laws on their heart, I will also write them on their mind;’” then he says, 17“I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more.”"
Hebrews,10,18,"Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. A Call to Persevere (Jude 1:17–23)"
Hebrews,10,19,"Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus, 20by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 21and having a great priest over the house of God, 22let’s draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water, 23let us hold"

Hebrews,10,38,"But the righteous will live by faith. If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.”"
Hebrews,10,39,"But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul."
Hebrews,11,1,"Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen."
Hebrews,11,2,"For by this, the elders obtained testimony."
Hebrews,11,3,"By faith, we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible. The Faith of Abel, Enoch, Noah (Genesis 4–9)"

Hebrews,11,7,"By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.

Hebrews,11,17,"By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son; 18even he to whom it was said, “In Isaac will your seed be called;” 19concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead. The Faith of Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph (Genesis 27–50)"
Hebrews,11,20,"By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come."
Hebrews,11,21,"By faith, Jacob, when he"

Hebrews,11,31,"By faith, Rahab the prostitute, didn’t perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace."
Hebrews,11,32,"What more shall I say? For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets; 33who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee."
Hebrews,11,35,"Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance,"
Hebrews,11,36,"Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes,"
Hebrews,11,37,"They were stoned. They were sawn apart. They were tempted. They were slain with the sword. They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth."
Hebrews,11,39,"These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith, didn’t receive the promise,"
Hebrews,11,40,"God having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect."
Hebrews,12,1,"Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, 2looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
Hebrews,12,3,"For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don’t grow weary, fainting in your souls. God Disciplines His Sons"
Hebrews,12,4,"You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin; 5and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children, “My son, don’t take lightly the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by him;"
Hebrews,12,6,"For whom the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives.”"

Hebrews,12,8,"But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers,"
Hebrews,12,9,"Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and"
Hebrews,12,10,"For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit,"
Hebrews,12,11,All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.

Hebrews,12,18,"For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, storm, 19the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them, 20for they could not stand that which was commanded, “If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned;” 21and so fearful was"
Hebrews,12,22,"But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels, 23to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, 24to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel."
Hebrews,12,25,"See that you don’t refuse him who speaks.

1 Peter,1,6,"Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been put to grief in various trials, 7that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ— 8whom not having known you love; in whom, though now you don’t see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory— 9receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls."
1 Peter,1,10,"Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you, 11searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that would follow them."
1 Peter,1,12,"To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, they ministered these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into. A Call to Holiness (Hebrews 12:14–17)"
1 Peter,1,13,"Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ— 14as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance, 15but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior; 16because it is written, “You shall be holy; for I am holy.”"
1 Peter,1,17,"If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man’s work, pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear: 18knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers, 19but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb, the blood of Christ; 20who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake, 21who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.

1 Peter,2,5,"You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,2,6,"Because it is contained in Scripture, “Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, and precious: He who believes in him will not be disappointed.”"
1 Peter,2,7,"For you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those who are disobedient, “The stone which the builders rejected, has become the chief cornerstone,” 8and, “a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense.” For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed."
1 Peter,2,9,"But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light: 10who in time past were no people, but now are God’s people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy."
1 Peter,2,11,"Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 12having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in the day of visitation. Submission to Authorities (Romans 13:1–7)"

1 Peter,2,21,"For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example, that you"
1 Peter,2,23,"Who, when he was cursed, didn’t curse back. When he suffered, didn’t threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously; 24who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to"

1 Peter,3,7,"You husbands, in the same way, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel, as being also joint heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers may not be hindered. Turning from Evil"
1 Peter,3,8,"Finally, be all like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, courteous, 9not rendering evil for evil, or insult for insult; but instead blessing; knowing that to this were you called, that you may inherit a blessing."
1 Peter,3,10,"For, “He who would love life, and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit."
1 Peter,3,11,"Let him turn away from evil, and do good. Let him seek peace, and pursue it."
1 Peter,3,12,"For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears open to their prayer; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”"
1 Peter,3,13,"Now who is he who will harm you, if you become imitators of that which is good? Suffering for Righteousness"
1 Peter,3,14,"But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “Don’t fear what they fear,"
1 Peter,3,15,"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear: 16having a good conscience; that, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be disappointed who"
1 Peter,3,17,"For it is better, if it is God’s will, that you suffer for doing well"
1 Peter,3,18,"Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit; 19in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison, 20who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ship was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved"
1 Peter,3,21,"This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you—not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him."
1 Peter,4,1,"Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin; 2that you no longer should live the rest of your time"

2 Peter,2,4,"For if God didn’t spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to Tartarus, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; 5and didn’t spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly; 6and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly; 7and delivered righteous Lot, who was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked 8(for that righteous man dwelling among them, was tormented in his righteous soul from day to day with seeing and hearing lawless deeds): 9the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment; 10but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries; 11whereas angels, though greater in might"
2 Peter,2,12,"But these, as unreasoning creatures, born natural animals to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant, will in their destroying surely be destroyed, 13receiving the wages of unrighteousness; people who count it pleasure to revel in the daytime, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceit while they feast with you; 14having eyes full of adultery, and who can’t cease from sin; enticing unsettled souls; having a heart trained in greed; children of cursing; 15forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wrongdoing; 16but he was rebuked for his own disobedience. A mute donkey spoke with a man’s voice and stopped the madness of the prophet."

2 Peter,2,18,"For, uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness, those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error; 19promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for a man is brought into bondage"

2 Peter,3,9,"The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness; but is patient with us, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
