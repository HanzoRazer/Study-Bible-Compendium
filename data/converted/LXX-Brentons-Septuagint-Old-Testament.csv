Joshua,6,6,"A) Charge the people to go round, and encompass the city; and let your men of war pass on armed before the Lord. Joshua 6:8 Joshua 6:9 And let the men of war proceed before, and the priests bringing up the rear behind the ark of the covenant of the Lord proceed sounding the trumpets. Joshua 6:10 And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Cry not out, nor let any one hear your voice, until he himself declare to you the time to cry out, and then ye shall cry out. Joshua 6:11 And the ark of the covenant of God having gone round immediately returned into the camp, and lodged there. Joshua 6:12 And on the second day Joshua rose up in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord. Joshua 6:13 And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets went on before the Lord; and afterwards the men of war went on, and the remainder of the multitude went after the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. Joshua 6:14 And all the rest of the multitude compassed the city six times from within a short distance, and went back again into the camp; this they did six days. Joshua 6:15 And on the seventh day they rose up early, and compassed the city on that day seven times. Joshua 6:16 And it came to pass at the seventh circuit the priests blew the trumpets; and Joshua said to the children of Israel, Shout, for the Lord has given you the city. Joshua 6:17 ¶ And the city shall be devoted, it and all things that are in it, to the Lord of Hosts: only do ye save Raab the harlot, and all things in her house. Joshua 6:18 But keep yourselves strictly from the accursed thing, lest ye set your mind upon and take of the accursed thing, and ye make the camp of the children of Israel and accursed thing, and destroy us. Joshua 6:19 And all the silver, or gold, or brass, or iron, shall be holy to the Lord; it shall be carried into the treasury of the Lord. Joshua 6:20 And the priests sounded with the trumpets: and when the people heard the trumpets, all the people shouted at once with a loud and strong shout; and all the wall fell round about, and all the people went up into the city: Joshua 6:21 and Joshua devoted it to destruction, and all things that were in the city, man and woman, young man and old, and calf and ass, with the edge of the sword. Joshua 6:22 And Joshua said to the two young men who had acted a spies, Go into the house of the woman, and bring her out thence, and all that she has. Joshua 6:23 And the two young men who had spied out the city entered into the house of the woman, and brought out Raab the harlot, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and her kindred, and all that she had; and they set her without the camp of Israel. Joshua 6:24 And the city was burnt with fire with all things that were in it; only of the silver, and gold, and brass, and iron, they gave to be brought into the treasury of the Lord. Joshua 6:25 And Joshua saved alive Raab the harlot, and all the house of her father, and caused her to dwell in Israel until this day, because she hid the spies which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. Joshua 6:26 And Joshua adjured them on that day before the Lord, saying, Cursed be the man who shall build that city: he shall lay the foundation of it in his first-born, and he shall set up the gates of it in his youngest son. And so did Hozan of Baethel; he laid the foundation in Abiron his first-born, and set up the gates of it in his youngest surviving son. Joshua 6:27 And the Lord was with Joshua, and his name was in all the land."

Joshua,19,48,"A) and the Amorite continued to dwell in Edom and in Salamin: and the hand of Ephraim prevailed against them, and they became tributaries to them. Joshua 19:48 (19:47) This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan, according to their families, these"
Joshua,19,47,"A) and the children of Dan did not drive out the Amorite who afflicted them in the mountain; and the Amorite would not suffer them to come down into the valley, but they forcibly took from them the border of their portion. Joshua 19:49 ¶ And they proceeded to take possession of the land according to their borders, and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Naue among them, Joshua 19:50 by the command of God, and they gave him the city which he asked for, Thamnasarach, which is in the mount of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt in it. Joshua 19:51 These are the divisions which Eleazar the priest divided by lot, and Joshua the son of Naue, and the heads of families among the tribes of Israel, according to the lots, in Selo before the Lord by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony, and they went to take possession of the land."
Joshua,21,36,"A) and Jazer and its suburbs; and Decmon and its suburbs; and Mapha and its suburbs; four cities. Joshua 21:38 (21:37) And out of the tribe of Gad the city of refuge for the slayer, both Ramoth in Galaad, and its suburbs; Camin and its suburbs; Joshua 21:39"
Joshua,21,37,"A) and Esbon and its suburbs; and Jazer and its suburbs: the cities were four in all. Joshua 21:40 (21:38) All these cities were given to the sons of Merari according to the families of them that were left out of the tribe of Levi; and their limits were the twelve cities. Joshua 21:41 (21:39) All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel, were forty-eight cities, (21:40) and their suburbs round about these cities: Joshua 21:42"
Joshua,21,40,A) a city and the suburbs round about the city to all these cities: (21:
Joshua,21,40,B) and Joshua ceased
Joshua,21,40,C) and the children of Israel gave a portion to Joshua because of the commandment of the Lord: they gave him the city which he asked: they gave him
Joshua,21,40,"D) and Joshua built the city, and dwelt in it: (21:"
Joshua,21,40,"E) and Joshua took the knives of stone, wherewith he circumcised the children of Israel that were born in the desert by the way, and put them in Thamnasachar. Joshua 21:43 ¶ (21:41) So the Lord gave to Israel all the land which he sware to give to their fathers: and they inherited it, and dwelt in it. Joshua 21:44 (21:42) And the Lord gave them rest round about, as he sware to their fathers: not one of all their enemies maintained his ground against them; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hands. Joshua 21:45 (21:43) There failed not one of the good things which the Lord spoke to the children of Israel; all came to pass."
Joshua,24,30,"A) there they put with him into the tomb in which they buried him, the knives of stone with which he circumcised the children of Israel in Galgala, when he brought them out of Egypt, as the Lord appointed them; and there they are to this day. Joshua 24:31 And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that lived as long as Joshua, and all that knew all the works of the Lord which he wrought for Israel. Joshua 24:32 And the children of Israel brought up the bones of Joseph out of Egypt, and buried them in Sicima, in the portion of the land which Jacob bought of the Amorites who dwelt in Sicima for a hundred ewe-lambs; and he gave it to Joseph for a portion. Joshua 24:33 And it came to pass afterwards that Eleazar the high-priest the son of Aaron died, and was buried in"
Joshua,24,33,"A) In that day the children of Israel took the ark of God, and carried it about among them; and Phinees exercised the priest's office in the room of Eleazar his father till he died, and he was buried in his own place Gabaar:"
Joshua,24,33,"B) but the children of Israel departed every one to their place, and to their own city: and the children of Israel worshipped Astarte, and Astaroth, and the gods of the nations round about them; and the Lord delivered them into the hands of Eglom king of Moab and he ruled over them eighteen years. Judges 1:1 ¶ And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel enquired of the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Chananites, to fight against them? Judges 1:2 And the Lord said, Judas shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand. Judges 1:3 And Judas said to his brother Symeon, Come up with me into my lot, and let us array ourselves against the Chananites, and I also will go with thee into thy lot: and Symeon went with him. Judges 1:4 And Judas went up; and the Lord delivered the Chananite and the Pherezite into their hands, and they smote them in Bezek to the number of ten thousand men. Judges 1:5 And they overtook Adonibezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they smote the Chananite and the Pherezite. Judges 1:6 And Adonibezek fled, and they pursued after him, and took him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. Judges 1:7 And Adonibezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table: as I therefore have done, so God has recompensed me: and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there. Judges 1:8 And the children of Judas fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote with the edge of the sword, and they burnt the city with fire. Judges 1:9 ¶ And afterwards the children of Judas went down to fight with the Chananite dwelling in the hill country, and the south, and the plain country. Judges 1:10 And Judas went to the Chananite who dwelt in Chebron; and Chebron came out against him; [[and the name of Chebron before was Cariatharbocsepher:]] and they smote Sessi, and Achiman, and Tholmi, children of Enac. Judges 1:11 And they went up thence to the inhabitants of Dabir; but the name of Dabir was before Cariathsepher, the city of Letters. Judges 1:12 And Chaleb said, Whosoever shall smite the city of Letters, and shall first take it, I will give to him Ascha my daughter to wife. Judges 1:13 And Gothoniel the younger son of Kenez the brother of Chaleb took it; and Chaleb gave him his daughter Ascha to wife. Judges 1:14 And it came to pass as she went in, that Gothoniel urged her to ask a field of her father; and she murmured and cried from off her ass, Thou hast sent me forth into a south land: and Chaleb said to her, What is thy request? Judges 1:15 And Ascha said to him, Give me, I pray thee, a blessing, for thou hast sent me forth into a south land, and thou shalt give me the ransom of water: and Chaleb gave her according to her heart the ransom of the upper springs and the ransom of the low springs. Judges 1:16 And the children of Jothor the Kenite the father-in-law of Moses went up from the city of palm- trees with the children of Judas, to the wilderness that is in the south of Juda, which is at the descent of Arad, and they dwelt with the people. Judges 1:17 And Judas went with Symeon his brother, and smote the Chananite that inhabited Sepheth, and they utterly destroyed them; and they called the name of the city Anathema. Judges 1:18 But Judas did not inherit Gaza nor her coasts, nor Ascalon nor her coasts, nor Accaron nor her coasts, nor Azotus nor the lands around it. Judges 1:19 And the Lord was with Judas, and he inherited the mountain; for they were not able to destroy the inhabitants of the valley, for Rechab prevented them. Judges 1:20 And they gave Chebron to Chaleb, as Moses said; and thence he inherited the three cities of the children of Enac. Judges 1:21 ¶ But the children of Benjamin did not take the inheritance of the Jebusite who dwelt in Jerusalem; and the Jebusite dwelt with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem until this day. Judges 1:22 And the sons of Joseph, they also went up to Baethel; and the Lord was with them. Judges 1:23 And they encamped and surveyed Baethel: and the name of the city before was Luza. Judges 1:24 And the spies looked, and behold, a man went out of the city, and they took him; and they said to him, Shew us the way into the city, and we will deal mercifully with thee. Judges 1:25 And he shewed them the way into the city; and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and his family. Judges 1:26 And the man went into the land of Chettin, and built there a city, and called the name of it Luza; this is its name until this day. Judges 1:27 And Manasse did not drive out the inhabitants of Baethsan, which is a city of Scythians, nor her towns, nor her suburbs; nor Thanac, nor her towns; nor the inhabitants of Dor, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; nor the inhabitant of Balac, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; nor the inhabitants of Magedo, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; nor the inhabitants of Jeblaam, nor her suburbs, nor her towns; and the Chananite began to dwell in this land. Judges 1:28 And it came to pass when Israel was strong, that he made the Chananite tributary, but did not utterly drive them out. Judges 1:29 And Ephraim did not drive out the Chananite that dwelt in Gazer; and the Chananite dwelt in the midst of him in Gazer, and became tributary. Judges 1:30 And Zabulon did not drive out the inhabitants of Kedron, nor the inhabitants of Domana: and the Chananite dwelt in the midst of them, and became tributary to them. Judges 1:31 And Aser did not drive out the inhabitants of Accho, and that people became tributary to him, nor the inhabitants of Dor, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor the inhabitants of Dalaph, nor Aschazi, nor Chebda, nor Nai, nor Ereo. Judges 1:32 And Aser dwelt in the midst of the Chananite who inhabited the land, for he could not drive him out. Judges 1:33 And Nephthali did not drive out the inhabitants of Baethsamys, nor the inhabitants of Baethanach; and Nephthali dwelt in the midst of the Chananite who inhabited the land: but the inhabitants of Bethsamys and of Baetheneth became tributary to them. Judges 1:34 And the Amorite drove out the children of Dan into the mountains, for they did not suffer them to come down into the valley. Judges 1:35 And the Amorite began to dwell in the mountain of shells, in which are bears, and foxes, in Myrsinon, and in Thalabin; and the hand of the house of Joseph was heavy upon the Amorite, and he became tributary to them. Judges 1:36 And the border of the Amorite was from the going up of Acrabin, from the rock and upwards."
Ruth,4,15,"A) should it happen that the name of Jonathan be discovered by the house of David, then let the Lord seek out the enemies of David. 1 Samuel 20:17 And Jonathan swore yet again to David, because he loved the soul of him that loved him. 1 Samuel 20:18 And Jonathan said, To-morrow is the new moon, and thou wilt be enquired for, because thy seat will be observed as vacant. 1 Samuel 20:19 And thou shalt stay three days, and watch an opportunity, and shalt come to thy place where thou mayest hide thyself in the day of thy business, and thou shalt wait by that ergab. 1 Samuel 20:20 And I will shoot three arrows, aiming them at a mark. 1 Samuel 20:21 And behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go find me the arrow. 1 Samuel 20:22 If I should expressly say to the lad, The arrow is here, and on this side of thee, take it; then come, for it is well with thee, and there is no reason for fear, as the Lord lives: but if I should say thus to the young man, The arrow is on that side of thee, and beyond; go, for the Lord hath sent thee away. 1 Samuel 20:23 And as for the word which thou and I have spoken, behold, the Lord is witness between me and thee for ever. 1 Samuel 20:24 ¶ So David hides himself in the field, and the new month arrives, and the king comes to the table to eat. 1 Samuel 20:25 And he sat upon his seat as in former times, even on his seat by the wall, and he went before Jonathan; and Abenner sat on one side of Saul, and the place of David was empty. 1 Samuel 20:26 And Saul said nothing on that day, for he said, It seems to have fallen out that he is not clean, because he has not purified himself. 1 Samuel 20:27 And it came to pass on the morrow, on the second day of the month, that the place of David was empty; and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has not the son of Jessae attended both yesterday and today at the table? 1 Samuel 20:28 And Jonathan answered Saul, and said to him, David asked leave of me to go as far as Bethleem his city; 1 Samuel 20:29 and he said, Let me go, I pray thee, for we have a family sacrifice in the city, and my brethren have sent for me; and now, if I have found grace in thine eyes, I will even go over and see my brethren: therefore he is not present at the table of the king. 1 Samuel 20:30 And Saul was exceedingly angry with Jonathan, and said to him, Thou son of traitorous damsels! for do I not know that thou art an accomplice with the son of Jessae to thy same, and to the shame of thy mother's nakedness? 1 Samuel 20:31 For so long as the son of Jessae lives upon the earth, thy kingdom shall not be established: now then send and take the young man, for he shall surely die. 1 Samuel 20:32 And Jonathan answered Saul, Why is he to die? What has he done? 1 Samuel 20:33 And Saul lifted up his spear against Jonathan to slay him: so Jonathan knew that this evil was determined on by his father to slay David. 1 Samuel 20:34 And Jonathan sprang up from the table in great anger, and did not eat bread on the second day of the month, for he grieved bitterly for David, because his father determined on mischief against him. 1 Samuel 20:35 ¶ And morning came, and Jonathan went out to the field, as he appointed to do for a signal to David, and a little boy was with him. 1 Samuel 20:36 And he said to the boy, Run, find me the arrows which I shoot: and the boy ran, and Jonathan shot an arrow, and sent it beyond him. 1 Samuel 20:37 And the boy came to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan shot; and Jonathan cried out after the lad, and said, The arrow is on that side of thee and beyond thee. 1 Samuel 20:38 And Jonathan cried out after his boy, saying, Make all speed, and stay not. And Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and brought the arrows to his master. 1 Samuel 20:39 And the boy knew nothing, only Jonathan and David knew. 1 Samuel 20:40 And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to his boy, Go, enter into the city. 1 Samuel 20:41 And when the lad went in, then David arose from the argab, and fell upon his face, and did obeisance to him three times, and they kissed each other, and wept for each other, for a great while. 1 Samuel 20:42 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, and as we have both sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord shall be witness between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever-even so let it be. And David arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city. 1 Samuel 21:1 ¶ And David comes to Nomba to Abimelech the priest: and Abimelech was amazed at meeting him, and said to him, Why art thou alone, and nobody with thee? 1 Samuel 21:2 And David said to the priest, The king gave me a command to-day, and said to me, Let no one know the matter on which I send thee, an concerning which I have charged thee: and I have charged my servants to be in the place that is called, The faithfulness of God, phellani maemoni. 1 Samuel 21:3 And now if there are under thy hand five loaves, give into my hand what is ready. 1 Samuel 21:4 And the priest answered David, and said, There are no common loaves under my hand, for I have none but holy loaves: if the young men have been kept at least from women, then they shall eat them. 1 Samuel 21:5 And David answered the priest, and said to him, Yea, we have been kept from women for three days: when I came forth for the journey all the young men were purified; but this expedition is unclean, wherefore it shall be sanctified this day because of my weapons. 1 Samuel 21:6 So Abimelech the priest gave him the shewbread; for there were no loaves there, but only the presence loaves which had been removed from the presence of the Lord, in order that hot bread should be set on, on the day on which he took them. 1 Samuel 21:7 And there was there on that day one of Saul's servants detained before the Lord, and his name was Doec the Syrian, tending the mules of Saul. 1 Samuel 21:8 And David said to Abimelech, See if there is here under thy hand spear or sword, for I have not brought in my hand my sword or my weapons, for the word of the king was urgent. 1 Samuel 21:9 And the priest said, Behold the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou smotest in the valley of Ela; and it is wrapt in a cloth: if thou wilt take it, take it for thyself, for there is no other except it here. And David said, Behold, there is none like it; give it me. 1 Samuel 21:10 ¶ And he gave it him; and David arose, and fled in that day from he presence of Saul: and David came to Anchus king of Geth. 1 Samuel 21:11 And the servants of Anchus said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? Did not the dancing women begin the son to him, saying, Saul has smitten his thousand, and David his ten thousands? 1 Samuel 21:12 And David laid up the words in his heart, and was greatly afraid of Anchus king of Geth. 1 Samuel 21:13 And he changed his appearance before him, and feigned himself a false character in that day; and drummed upon the doors of the city, and used extravagant gestures with his hands, and fell against the doors of the gate, and his spittle ran down upon his beard. 1 Samuel 21:14 And Anchus said to his servants, Lo! ye see the man is mad: why have ye brought him in to me? 1 Samuel 21:15 Am I in want of madmen, that ye have brought him in to me to play the madman? He shall not come into the house. 1 Samuel 22:1 ¶ And David departed thence, and escaped; and he comes to the cave of Odollam, and his brethren hear, and the house of his father, and they go down to him there. 1 Samuel 22:2 And there gathered to him every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was troubled in mind; and he was a leader over them, and there were with him about four hundred men. 1 Samuel 22:3 And David departed thence to Massephath of Moab, and said to the king of Moab, Let, I pray thee, my father and my mother be with thee, until I know what God will do to me. 1 Samuel 22:4 And he persuaded the King of Moab, and they dwell with him continually, while David was in the hold. 1 Samuel 22:5 And Gad the prophet said to David, Dwell not in the hold: go, and thou shalt enter the land of Juda. So David went, and came and dwelt in the city of Saric. 1 Samuel 22:6 ¶ And Saul heard that David was discovered, and his men with him: now Saul dwelt in the hill below the field that is in Rama, and his spear was in his hand, and all his servants stood near him. 1 Samuel 22:7 And Saul said to his servants that stood by him, Hear now, ye sons of Benjamin, will the son of Jessae indeed give all of you fields and vineyards, and will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands? 1 Samuel 22:8 That ye are conspiring against me, and there is no one that informs me, whereas my son has made a covenant with the son of Jessae, and there is no one of you that is sorry for me, or informs me, that my son has stirred up my servant against me for an enemy, as it is this day? 1 Samuel 22:9 And Doec the Syrian who was over the mules of Saul answered and said, I saw the son of Jessae as he came to Nomba to Abimelech son of Achitob the priest. 1 Samuel 22:10 And the priest enquired of God for him, and gave him provision, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. 1 Samuel 22:11 And the king sent to call Abimelech son of Achitob and all his father's sons, the priests that were in Nomba; and they all came to the king. 1 Samuel 22:12 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Achitob. And he said, Lo! I am here, speak, my lord. 1 Samuel 22:13 And Saul said to him, Why have thou and the son of Jessae conspired against me, that thou shouldest give him bread and a sword, and shouldest enquire of God for him, to raise him up against me as an enemy, as he is this day? 1 Samuel 22:14 And he answered the king, and said, And who is there among all thy servants faithful as David, and he is a son-in-law of the king, and he is executor of all thy commands, and is honourable in thy house? 1 Samuel 22:15 Have I begun to-day to enquire of God for him? By no means: let not the king bring a charge against his servant, and against thee whole of my father's house; for thy servant knew not in all these matters anything great or small. 1 Samuel 22:16 And king Saul said, Thou shalt surely die, Abimelech, thou, and all thy father's house. 1 Samuel 22:17 And the king said to the footmen that attended on him, Draw nigh and slay the priests of the Lord, because their hand is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and they did not inform me. But the servants of the king would not lift their hands to fall upon the priest of the Lord. 1 Samuel 22:18 And the king said to Doec, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests: and Doec the Syrian turned, and slew the priests of the Lord in that day, three hundred and five men, all wearing an ephod. 1 Samuel 22:19 And he smote Nomba the city of the priest with the edge of the sword, both man, and woman, infant and suckling, and calf, and ox, and sheep. 1 Samuel 22:20 ¶ And one son of Abimelech son of Achitob escapes, and his name was Abiathar, and he fled after David. 1 Samuel 22:21 And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain all the priests of the Lord. 1 Samuel 22:22 And David said to Abiathar, I knew it in that day, that Doec the Syrian would surely tell Saul: I am guilty of the death of the house of thy father. 1 Samuel 22:23 Dwell with me; fear not, for wherever I shall seek a place of safety for my life, I will also seek a place for thy life, for thou art safely guarded while with me. 1 Samuel 23:1 ¶ And it was told David, saying, behold, the Philistines war in Keila, and they rob, they trample on the threshing-floors. 1 Samuel 23:2 And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said, Go, and thou shalt smite these Philistines, and shalt save Keila. 1 Samuel 23:3 And the men of David said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judea; and how shall it be if we go to Keila? Shall we go after the spoils of the Philistines? 1 Samuel 23:4 And David enquired yet again of the Lord; and the Lord answered him, and said to him, Arise and go down to Keila, for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hands. 1 Samuel 23:5 So David and his men with him went to Keila, and fought with the Philistines; and they fled from before him, and he carried off their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter, and David rescued the inhabitants of Keila. 1 Samuel 23:6 And it came to pass when Abiathar the son of Achimelech fled to David, that he went down with David to Keila, having and ephod in his hand. 1 Samuel 23:7 ¶ And it was told Saul that David was come to Keila: and Saul said, God has sold him into my hands, for he is shut up, having entered into a city that has gates and bars. 1 Samuel 23:8 And Saul charged all the people to go down to war to Keila, to besiege David and his men. 1 Samuel 23:9 And David knew that Saul spoke openly of mischief against him: and David said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod of the Lord. 1 Samuel 23:10 And David said, Lord God of Israel, thy servant has indeed heard, that Saul seeks to come against Keila to destroy the city on my account. 1 Samuel 23:11 Will the place be shut up? And now will Saul come down, as thy servant has heard? Lord God of Israel, tell thy servant. And the Lord said, It will be shut up. 1 Samuel 23:12 1 Samuel 23:13 And David arose, and the men with him, in number about four hundred, and they went forth from Keila, and went whithersoever they could go: and it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keila, and he forbore to come. 1 Samuel 23:14 ¶ And he dwelt in Maserem in the wilderness, in the narrow passes; and dwelt in the wilderness in mount Ziph, in the dry country. And Saul sought him continually, but the Lord delivered him not into his hands. 1 Samuel 23:15 And David perceived that Saul went forth to seek David; and David was in the dry mountain in the New Ziph. 1 Samuel 23:16 And Jonathan son of Saul rose, and went to David to Caene, and strengthened his hands in the Lord. 1 Samuel 23:17 And he said to him, Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be second to thee; and Saul my father knows it. 1 Samuel 23:18 So they both made a covenant before the Lord; and David dwelt in Caene, and Jonathan went to his home. 1 Samuel 23:19 ¶ And the Ziphites came up out of the dry country to Saul to the hill, saying, Behold, is not David hidden with us in Messara, in the narrows in Caene in the hill of Echela, which is on the right of Jessaemon? 1 Samuel 23:20 And now according to all the king's desire to come down, let him come down to us; they have shut him up into the hands of the king. 1 Samuel 23:21 And Saul said to them, Blessed be ye of the Lord, for ye have been grieved on my account. 1 Samuel 23:22 Go, I pray you, and make preparations yet, and notice his place where his foot shall be, quickly, in that place which ye spoke of, lest by any means he should deal craftily. 1 Samuel 23:23 Take notice, then, and learn, and I will go with you; and it shall come to pass that if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Juda. 1 Samuel 23:24 And the Ziphites arose, and went before Saul: and David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, westward, to the right of Jessaemon. 1 Samuel 23:25 And Saul and his men went to seek him: and they brought word to David, and he went down to the rock that was in the wilderness of Maon: and Saul heard, and followed after David to the wilderness of Maon. 1 Samuel 23:26 And Saul and his men go on one side of the mountain, and David and his men are on the other side of the mountain: and David was hiding himself to escape from Saul: and Saul and his men encamped against David and his men, in order to take them. 1 Samuel 23:27 And there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come hither, for the Philistines have invaded the land. 1 Samuel 23:28 So Saul returned from following after David, and went to meet the Philistines: therefore that place was called The divided Rock. 1 Samuel 23:29 (24:1) And David rose up from thence, and dwelt in the narrow passes of Engaddi. 1 Samuel 24:1 ¶ (24:2) And it came to pass when Saul returned from pursuing after the Philistines, that it was reported to him, saying, David is in the wilderness of Engaddi. 1 Samuel 24:2 (24:3) And he took with him three thousand men, chosen out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men in front of Saddaeem. 1 Samuel 24:3 (24:4) And he came to the flocks of sheep that were by the way, and there was a cave there; and Saul went in to make preparation, and David and his men were sitting in the inner part of the cave. 1 Samuel 24:4 (24:5) And the men of David said to him, Behold, this is the day of which the Lord spoke to thee, that he would deliver thine enemy into thy hands; and thou shalt do to him as it is good in thy sight. So David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul's garment secretly. 1 Samuel 24:5 (24:6) And it came to pass after this that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off the skirt of his garment. 1 Samuel 24:6 (24:7) And David said to his men, The Lord forbid it me, that I should do this ting to my lord the anointed of the Lord, to lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the Lord. 1 Samuel 24:7 (24:8) So David persuaded his men by his words, and did not suffer them to arise and slay Saul: and Saul arose and went his way. 1 Samuel 24:8 (24:9) And David rose up and went after him out of the cave: and David cried after Saul, saying, My lord, O king! and Saul looked behind him, and David bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance to him. 1 Samuel 24:9 ¶ (24:10) And David said to Saul, Why dost thou hearken to the words of the people, saying, Behold, David seeks thy life? 1 Samuel 24:10 (24:11) Behold, thine eyes have seen this day how that the Lord has delivered thee this day into my hands in the cave; and I would not slay thee, but spared thee, and said, I will not lift up my hand against my lord, for he is the Lord's anointed. 1 Samuel 24:11 (24:12) And behold, the skirt of thy mantle is in my hand, I cut off the skirt, and did not slay thee: know then and see to-day, there is no evil in my hand, nor impiety, nor rebellion; and I have not sinned against thee, yet thou layest snares for my soul to take it. 1 Samuel 24:12 (24:13) The Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord requite thee on thyself: but my hand shall not be upon thee. 1 Samuel 24:13 (24:14) As the old proverb says, Transgression will proceed from the wicked ones: but my hand shall not be upon thee. 1 Samuel 24:14 (24:15) And now after whom dost thou come forth, O king of Israel? After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead dog, and after a flea? 1 Samuel 24:15 (24:16) The Lord be judge and umpire between me and thee, the Lord look upon and judge my cause, and rescue me out of thy hand. 1 Samuel 24:16 ¶ (24:17) And it came to pass when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, Son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. 1 Samuel 24:17 (24:18) And Saul said to David, Thou art more righteous that I, for thou hast recompensed me good, but I have recompensed thee evil. 1 Samuel 24:18 (24:19) And thou hast told me to-day what good thou hast done me, how the Lord shut me up into thy hands to-day, and thou didst not slay me. 1 Samuel 24:19 (24:20) And if any one should find his enemy in distress, and should send him forth in a good way, then the Lord will reward him good, as thou has done this day. 1 Samuel 24:20 (24:21) And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely reign, and the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand. 1 Samuel 24:21 (24:22) Now then swear to me by the Lord, that thou wilt not destroy my seed after me, that thou wilt not blot out my name from the house of my father. 1 Samuel 24:22 (24:23) So David swore to Saul: and Saul departed to his place, and David and his men went up to the strong-hold of Messera. 1 Samuel 25:1 ¶ And Samuel died, and all Israel assembled, and bewailed him, and they bury him in his house in Armathaim: and David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Maon. 1 Samuel 25:2 ¶ And there was a man in Maon, and his flocks were in Carmel, and he was a very great man; and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand she-goats: and he happened to be shearing his flock in Carmel. 1 Samuel 25:3 And the man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigaia: and his wife was of good understanding and very beautiful in person: but the man was harsh, and evil in his doings, and the man was churlish. 1 Samuel 25:4 And David heard in the wilderness, that Nabal the Carmelite was shearing his sheep. 1 Samuel 25:5 And David sent ten young men, and he said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and ask him in my name how he is. 1 Samuel 25:6 And thus shall ye say, May thou and thy house seasonably prosper, and all thine be in prosperity. 1 Samuel 25:7 And now, behold, I have heard that thy shepherds who were with is in the wilderness are shearing thy sheep, and we hindered them not, neither did we demand any thing from them all the time they were in Carmel. 1 Samuel 25:8 Ask thy servants, and they will tell thee. Let then thy servants find grace in thine eyes, for we are come on a good day; give we pray thee, whatsoever thy hand may find, to thy son David. 1 Samuel 25:9 So the servants come and speak these words to Nabal, according to all these words in the name of David. 1 Samuel 25:10 And Nabal sprang up, and answered the servants of David, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jessae? Now-a-days there is abundance of servants who depart every one from his master. 1 Samuel 25:11 And shall I take my bread, and my wine, and my beasts that I have slain for my shearers, and shall I give them to men of whom I know not whence they are? 1 Samuel 25:12 ¶ So the servants of David turned back, and returned, and came and reported to David according to these words. 1 Samuel 25:13 And David said to his men, Gird on every man his sword. And they went up after David, about four hundred men: and two hundred abode with the stuff. 1 Samuel 25:14 And one of the servants reported to Abigaia the wife of Nabal, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our lord; but he turned away from them. 1 Samuel 25:15 And the men were very good to us; they did not hinder us, neither did they demand from us any thing all the days that we were with them. 1 Samuel 25:16 And when we were in the field, they were as a wall round about us, both by night and by day, all the days that we were with them feeding the flock. 1 Samuel 25:17 And now do thou consider, and see what thou wilt do; for mischief is determined against our lord and against his house; and he is a vile character, and one cannot speak to him. 1 Samuel 25:18 ¶ And Abigaia hasted, and took two hundred loaves, and two vessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five ephahs of fine flour, and one homer of dried grapes, and two hundred cakes of figs, and put them upon asses. 1 Samuel 25:19 And she said to her servants, Go on before me, and behold I come after you: but she told not her husband. 1 Samuel 25:20 And it came to pass when she had mounted her ass and was going down by the covert of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down to meet her, and she met them. 1 Samuel 25:21 And David said, Perhaps I have kept all his possessions in the wilderness that he should wrong me, and we did not order the taking anything of all his goods; yet he has rewarded me evil for good. 1 Samuel 25:22 So God do to David and more also, if I leave one male of all that belong to Nabal until the morning. 1 Samuel 25:23 And Abigaia saw David, and she hasted and alighted from her ass; and she felt before David on her face, and did obeisance to him, bowing to the ground 1 Samuel 25:24 even to his feet, and said, On me, my lord, be my wrong: let, I pray thee, thy servant speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy servant. 1 Samuel 25:25 Let not my lord, I pray thee, take to heart this pestilent man, for according to his name, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the servants of my lord whom thou didst send. 1 Samuel 25:26 And now, my lord, as the Lord lives, and thy soul lives, as the Lord has kept thee from coming against innocent blood, and from executing vengeance for thyself, now therefore let thine enemies, and those that seek evil against my lord, become as Nabal. 1 Samuel 25:27 And now accept this token of goodwill, which thy servant has brought to my lord, and thou shalt give it to the servants that wait on my lord. 1 Samuel 25:28 Remove, I pray thee, the trespass of thy servant; for the Lord will surely make for my lord a sure house, for the Lord fights the battles of my lord, and there shall no evil be ever found in thee. 1 Samuel 25:29 And if a man shall rise up persecuting thee and seeking thy life, yet shall the life of my lord be bound up in the bundle of life with the Lord God, and thou shalt whirl the life of thine enemies as in the midst of a sling. 1 Samuel 25:30 And it shall be when the Lord shall have wrought for my lord all the good things he has spoken concerning thee, and shall appoint thee to be ruler over Israel; 1 Samuel 25:31 then this shall not be an abomination and offence to my lord, to have shed innocent blood without cause, and for my lord to have avenged himself: and so may the Lord do good to my lord, and thou shalt remember thine handmaid to do her good. 1 Samuel 25:32 ¶ And David said to Abigaia, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who sent thee this very day to meet me: 1 Samuel 25:33 and blessed be thy conduct, and blessed be thou, who hast hindered me this very day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself. 1 Samuel 25:34 But surely as the Lord God of Israel lives, who hindered me this day from doing thee harm, if thou hadst not hasted and come to meet me, then I said, There shall surely not be left to Nabal till the morning one male. 1 Samuel 25:35 And David took of her hand all that she brought to him, and said to her, Go in peace to thy house: see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and accepted thy petition. 1 Samuel 25:36 ¶ And Abigaia came to Nabal: and, behold, he had a banquet in this house, as the banquet of a king, and the heart of Nabal was merry within him, and he was very drunken: and she told him nothing great or small till the morning light. 1 Samuel 25:37 And it came to pass in the morning, when Nabal recovered from his wine, his wife told him these words; and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. 1 Samuel 25:38 And it came to pass after about ten days, that the Lord smote Nabal, and he died. 1 Samuel 25:39 And David heard it and said, Blessed be the Lord, who has judged the cause of my reproach at the hand of Nabal, and has delivered his servant from the power of evil; and the Lord has returned the mischief of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and spoke concerning Abigaia, to take her to himself for a wife. 1 Samuel 25:40 So the servants of David came to Abigaia to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to thee, to take thee to himself for a wife. 1 Samuel 25:41 And she arose, and did reverence with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy servant is for an handmaid to wash the feet of thy servants. 1 Samuel 25:42 And Abigaia arose, and mounted her ass, and five damsels followed her: and she went after the servants of David, and became his wife. 1 Samuel 25:43 And David took Achinaam out of Jezrael, and they were both his wives. 1 Samuel 25:44 And Saul gave Melchol his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Amis who was of Romma. 1 Samuel 26:1 ¶ And the Ziphites come out of the dry country to Saul to the hill, saying, Behold, David hides himself with us in the hill Echela, opposite Jessemon. 1 Samuel 26:2 And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and with him went three thousand men chosen out of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. 1 Samuel 26:3 And Saul encamped in the hill of Echela in front of Jessemon, by the way, and David dwelt in the wilderness: and David saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. 1 Samuel 26:4 And David sent spies, and ascertained that Saul was come prepared out of Keila. 1 Samuel 26:5 And David arose secretly, and goes into the place where Saul was sleeping, and there was Abenner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul was sleeping in a chariot, and the people had encamped along round about him. 1 Samuel 26:6 ¶ And David answered and spoke to Abimelech the Chettite, and to Abessa the son Saruia the brother of Joab, saying, Who will go in with me to Saul into the camp? And Abessa said, I will go in with thee. 1 Samuel 26:7 So David and Abessa go in among the people by night: and behold, Saul was fast asleep in the chariot, and his spear was stuck in the ground near his head, and Abenner and his people slept round about him. 1 Samuel 26:8 And Abessa said to David, The Lord has this day shut up thine enemy into thine hands, and now I will smite him to the earth with the spear to the ground once for all, and I will not smite him again. 1 Samuel 26:9 And David said to Abessa, Do not lay him low, for who shall lift up his hand against the anointed of the Lord, and be guiltless? 1 Samuel 26:10 And David said, As the Lord lives, if the Lord smite him not, or his day come and he die, or he go down to battle and be added to his fathers, do not so. 1 Samuel 26:11 The Lord forbid it me that I should lift up my hand against the anointed of the Lord: and now take, I pray thee, the spear from his bolster, and the pitcher of water, and let us return home. 1 Samuel 26:12 So David took the spear, and the pitcher of water from his bolster, and they went home: and there was no one that saw, and no one that knew, and there was no one that awoke, all being asleep, for a stupor from the Lord had fallen upon them. 1 Samuel 26:13 ¶ So David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, and there was a good distance between them. 1 Samuel 26:14 And David called to the people, and spoke to Abenner, saying, Wilt thou not answer, Abenner? and Abenner answered and said, Who art thou that callest? 1 Samuel 26:15 And David said to Abenner, Art not thou a man? and who is like thee in Israel? Why then dost thou not guard thy lord the king? for one out of the people went in to destroy thy lord the king. 1 Samuel 26:16 And this thing is not good which thou hast done. As the Lord lives, ye are worthy of death, ye who guard your lord the king, the anointed of the Lord: and now behold, I pray you, the spear of the king, and the cruse of water: where are the articles that should be at his head? 1 Samuel 26:17 And Saul recognized the voice of David, and said, Is this thy voice, son David? and David said, I am thy servant, my lord, O king. 1 Samuel 26:18 And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue after his servant? for in what have I sinned? and what unrighteousness has been found in me? 1 Samuel 26:19 And now let my lord the king hear the word of his servant. If God stirs thee up against me, let thine offering be acceptable: but if the sons of men, they are cursed before the Lord, for they have cast me out this day so that I should not be established in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other Gods. 1 Samuel 26:20 And now let not my blood fall to the ground before the Lord, for the king of Israel has come forth to seek thy life, as the night hawk pursues its prey in the mountains. 1 Samuel 26:21 ¶ And Saul said, I have sinned: turn, son David, for I will not hurt thee, because my life was precious in thine eyes; and to-day I have been foolish and have erred exceedingly. 1 Samuel 26:22 And David answered and said, Behold, the spear of the king: let one of the servants come over and take it. 1 Samuel 26:23 And the Lord shall recompense each according to his righteousness and his truth, since the Lord delivered thee this day into my hands, and I would not lift my hand against the Lord's anointed. 1 Samuel 26:24 And, behold, as thy life has been precious this very day in my eyes, so let my life be precious before the Lord, and may he protect me, and deliver me out of all affliction. 1 Samuel 26:25 And Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son; and thou shalt surely do valiantly, and surely prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place. 1 Samuel 27:1 ¶ And David said in his heart, Now shall I be one day delivered for death into the hands of Saul; and there is no good thing for me unless I should escape into the land of the Philistines, and Saul should cease from seeking me through every coast of Israel: so I shall escape out of his hand. 1 Samuel 27:2 So David arose, and the six hundred men that were with him, and he went to Anchus, son Ammach, king of Geth. 1 Samuel 27:3 And David dwelt with Anchus, he and his men, each with his family; and David and both his wives, Achinaam, the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 1 Samuel 27:4 And it was told Saul that David had fled to Geth; and he no longer sought after him. 1 Samuel 27:5 And David said to Anchus, If now thy servant has found grace in thine eyes, let them give me, I pray thee, a place in one of the cities in the country, and I will dwell there: for why does thy servant dwell with thee in a royal city? 1 Samuel 27:6 And he gave him Sekelac in that day: therefore Sekelac came into possession of the king of Judea to this day. 1 Samuel 27:7 And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was four months. 1 Samuel 27:8 ¶ And David and his men went up, and made an attack on all the Gesirites and on the Amalekites: and behold, the land was inhabited, (even the land from Gelampsur) by those who come from the fortified cities even to the land of Egypt. 1 Samuel 27:9 And he smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive; and they took flocks, and herds, and asses, and camels, and raiment; and they returned and came to Anchus. 1 Samuel 27:10 And Anchus said to David, On whom have ye made an attack to-day? And David said to Anchus, On the south of Judea, and on the south of Jesmega, and on the south of the Kenezite. 1 Samuel 27:11 And I have not saved man or woman alive to bring them to Geth, saying, Lest they carry a report to Geth against us, saying, These things David does. And this was his manner all the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines. 1 Samuel 27:12 So David had the full confidence of Anchus, who said, He is thoroughly disgraced among his people in Israel and he shall be my servant for ever. 1 Samuel 28:1 ¶ And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered themselves together with their armies to go out to fight with Israel; and Anchus said to David, Know surely, that thou shalt go forth to battle with me, thou, and thy men. 1 Samuel 28:2 And David said to Anchus, Thus now thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Anchus said to David, So will I make thee captain of my body-guard continually. 1 Samuel 28:3 And Samuel died, and all Israel lamented for him, and they bury him in his city, in Armathaim. And Saul had removed those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. 1 Samuel 28:4 And the Philistines assemble themselves, and come and encamp in Sonam: and Saul gathers all the men of Israel, and they encamp in Gelbue. 1 Samuel 28:5 And Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, and he was alarmed, and his heart was greatly dismayed. 1 Samuel 28:6 And Saul enquired of the Lord; and the Lord answered him not by dreams, nor by manifestations, nor by prophets. 1 Samuel 28:7 ¶ Then Saul said to his servants, Seek for me a woman who has in her a divining spirit, and I will go to her, and enquire of her: and his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has in her a divining spirit at Aendor. 1 Samuel 28:8 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he goes, and two men with him, and they come to the woman by night; and he said to her, Divine to me, I pray thee, by the divining spirit within thee, and bring up to me him whom I shall name to thee. 1 Samuel 28:9 And the woman said to him, Behold now, thou knowest what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards from the land, and why dost thou spread a snare for my life to destroy it? 1 Samuel 28:10 And Saul swore to her, and said, As the Lord lives, no injury shall come upon thee on this account. 1 Samuel 28:11 And the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to thee? and he said, Bring up to me Samuel. 1 Samuel 28:12 And the woman saw Samuel, and cried out with a loud voice: and the woman said to Saul, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul. 1 Samuel 28:13 And the king said to her, Fear not; tell me whom thou has seen. And the woman said to him, I saw gods ascending out of the earth. 1 Samuel 28:14 And he said to her, What didst thou perceive? and she said to him, An upright man ascending out of the earth, and he was clothed with a mantle. And Saul knew that this was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the earth, and did obeisance to him. 1 Samuel 28:15 ¶ And Samuel said, Why hast thou troubled me, that I should come up? And Saul said, I am greatly distressed, and the Philistines war against me, and God has departed from me, and no longer hearkens to me either by the hand of the prophets or by dreams: and now I have called thee to tell me what I shall do. 1 Samuel 28:16 And Samuel said, Why askest thou me, whereas the Lord has departed from thee, and taken part with thy neighbour? 1 Samuel 28:17 And the Lord has done to thee, as the Lord spoke by me; and the Lord will rend thy kingdom out of thy hand, and will give it to thy neighbour David. 1 Samuel 28:18 because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the Lord, and didst not execute his fierce anger upon Amalec, therefore the Lord has done this thing to thee this day. 1 Samuel 28:19 And the Lord shall deliver Israel with thee into the hands of the Philistines, and to-morrow thou and thy sons with thee shall fall, and the Lord shall deliver the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines. 1 Samuel 28:20 ¶ And Saul instantly fell at his full length upon the earth, and was greatly afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no longer any strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all that day, and all that night. 1 Samuel 28:21 And the woman went in to Saul, and saw that he was greatly disquieted, and said to him, Behold now, thine handmaid has hearkened to thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have heard the words which thou has spoken to me. 1 Samuel 28:22 And now hearken, I pray thee, to the voice of thine handmaid, and I will set before thee a morsel of bread, and eat, and thou shalt be strengthened, for thou wilt be going on thy way. 1 Samuel 28:23 But he would not eat; so his servants and the woman constrained him, and he hearkened to their voice, and rose up from the earth, and sat upon a bench. 1 Samuel 28:24 And the woman had a fat heifer in the house; and she hasted and slew it; and she took meal and kneaded it, and baked unleavened cakes. 1 Samuel 28:25 And she brought the meat before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate, and rose up, and departed that night. 1 Samuel 29:1 ¶ And the Philistines gather all their armies to Aphec, and Israel encamped in Aendor, which is in Jezrael. 1 Samuel 29:2 And the lords of the Philistines went on by hundreds and thousands, and David and his men went on in the rear with Anchus. 1 Samuel 29:3 And the lords of the Philistines said, Who are these that pass by? And Anchus said to the captains of the Philistines, Is not this David the servant of Saul king of Israel? He has been with us some time, even this second year, and I have not found any fault in him from the day that he attached himself to me even until this day. 1 Samuel 29:4 And the captains of the Philistines were displeased at him, and they say to him, Send the man away, and let him return to his place, where thou didst set him; and let him not come with us to the war, and let him not be a traitor in the camp: and wherewith will he be reconciled to his master? Will it not be with the heads of those men? 1 Samuel 29:5 Is not this David whom they celebrated in dances, saying, Saul has smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands? 1 Samuel 29:6 ¶ And Anchus called David, and said to him, As the Lord lives, thou art right and approved in my eyes, and so is thy going out and thy coming in with me in the army, and I have not found any evil to charge against thee from the day that thou camest to me until this day: but thou art not approved in the eyes of the lords. 1 Samuel 29:7 Now then return and go in peace, thus thou shalt not do evil in the sight of the lords of the Philistines. 1 Samuel 29:8 And David said to Anchus, What have I done to thee? and what hast thou found in thy servant from the first day that I was before thee even until this day, that I should not come and war against the enemies of the lord my king? 1 Samuel 29:9 And Anchus answered David, I know that thou art good in my eyes, but the lords of the Philistines say, He shall not come with us to the war. 1 Samuel 29:10 Now then rise up early in the morning, thou and the servants of thy lord that are come with thee, and go to the place where I appointed you, and entertain no evil thought in thy heart, for thou art good in my sight: and rise early for your journey when it is light, and depart. 1 Samuel 29:11 So David arose early, he and his men, to depart and guard the land of the Philistines: and the Philistines went up to Jezrael to battle. 1 Samuel 30:1 ¶ And it came to pass when David and his men had entered Sekelac on the third day, that Amalec had made an incursion upon the south, and upon Sekelac, and smitten Sekelac, and burnt it with fire. 1 Samuel 30:2 And as to the women and all things that were in it, great and small, they slew neither man nor woman, but carried them captives, and went on their way. 1 Samuel 30:3 And David and his men came into the city, and, behold, it was burnt with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters were carried captive. 1 Samuel 30:4 And David and his men lifted up their voice, and wept till there was no longer any power within them to weep. 1 Samuel 30:5 And both the wives of David were carried captive, Achinaam, the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 1 Samuel 30:6 And David was greatly distressed, because the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, each for his sons and his daughters: but David strengthened himself in the Lord his God. 1 Samuel 30:7 ¶ And David said to Abiathar the priest the son of Achimelech, Bring near the ephod. 1 Samuel 30:8 And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? and he said to him, Pursue, for thou shalt surely overtake them, and thou shalt surely rescue the captives . 1 Samuel 30:9 So David went, he an the six hundred men with him, an they come as far as the brook Bosor, and the superfluous ones stopped. 1 Samuel 30:10 And he pursued them with four hundred men; and there remained behind two hundred men, who tarried on the other side of the brook Bosor. 1 Samuel 30:11 And they find an Egyptian in the field, and they take him, and bring him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, and they caused him to drink water. 1 Samuel 30:12 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and he ate, and his spirit was restored in him; for he had not eaten bread, and had not drunk water three days and three nights. 1 Samuel 30:13 And David said to him, Whose art thou? and whence art thou? and the young man the Egyptian said, I am the servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me, because I was taken ill three days ago. 1 Samuel 30:14 And we made an incursion on the south of the Chelethite, and on the parts of Judea, and on the south of Chelub, and we burnt Sekelac with fire. 1 Samuel 30:15 And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear now to me by God, that thou wilt not kill me, and that thou wilt not deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down upon this troop. 1 Samuel 30:16 So be brought him down thither, and behold, they were scattered abroad upon the surface of the whole land, eating and drinking, and feasting by reason of all the great spoils which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Juda. 1 Samuel 30:17 And David came upon them, and smote them from the morning till the evening, and on the next day; and not one of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who were mounted on camels, and fled. 1 Samuel 30:18 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and he rescued both his wives. 1 Samuel 30:19 And nothing was wanting to them of great or small, either of the spoils, or the sons and daughters, or anything that they had taken of theirs; and David recovered all. 1 Samuel 30:20 And he took all the flocks, and the herds, and led them away before the spoils: and it was said of these spoils, These are the spoils of David. 1 Samuel 30:21 ¶ And David comes to the two hundred men who were left behind that they should not follow after David, and he had caused them to remain by the brook of Bosor; and they came forth to meet David, and to meet his people with him: and David drew near to the people, and they asked him how he did. 1 Samuel 30:22 Then every ill-disposed and bad man of the soldiers who had gone with David, answered and said, Because they did not pursue together with us, we will not give them of the spoils which we have recovered, only let each one lead away with him his wife and his children, and let them return. 1 Samuel 30:23 And David said, Ye shall not do so, after the Lord has delivered the enemy to us, and guarded us, and the Lord has delivered into our hands the troop that came against u. 1 Samuel 30:24 And who will hearken to these your words? for they are not inferior to us; for according to the portion of him that went down to the battle, so shall be the portion of him that abides with the baggage; they shall share alike. 1 Samuel 30:25 And it came to pass from that day forward, that it became an ordinance and a custom in Israel until this day. 1 Samuel 30:26 And David came to Sekelac, and sent of the spoils to the elders of Juda, and to his friends, saying, Behold some of the spoils of the enemies of the Lord; 1 Samuel 30:27 to those in Baethsur, and to those in Rama of the south, and to those in Gethor. 1 Samuel 30:28 And to those in Aroer, and to those in Ammadi, and to those in Saphi, and to those in Esthie, (30:29) and to those in Geth, and to those in Cimath, and to those in Saphec, and to those in Themath, 1 Samuel 30:29 and to those in Carmel, and to those in the cities of Jeremeel, and to those in the cities of the Kenezite; 1 Samuel 30:30 and to those in Jerimuth, and to those in Bersabee, and to those in Nombe, 1 Samuel 30:31 and to those in Chebron, and to all the places which David and his men had passed through. 1 Samuel 31:1 ¶ And the Philistines fought with Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and they fall down wounded in the mountain in Gelbue. 1 Samuel 31:2 And the Philistines press closely on Saul and his sons, and the Philistines smite Jonathan, and Aminadab, and Melchisa son of Saul. 1 Samuel 31:3 And the battle prevails against Saul, and the shooters with arrows, even the archers find him, and he was wounded under the ribs. 1 Samuel 31:4 And Saul said to his armour-bearer, Draw thy sword and pierce me through with it; lest these uncircumcised come and pierce me through, and mock me. But his armour-bearer would not, for he feared greatly: so Saul took his sword and fell upon it. 1 Samuel 31:5 And his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, and he fell also himself upon his sword, and died with him. 1 Samuel 31:6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armour-bearer, in that day together. 1 Samuel 31:7 And the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those beyond Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead; and they leave their cities and flee: and the Philistines come and dwell in them. 1 Samuel 31:8 ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow that the Philistines come to strip the dead, and they find Saul and his three sons fallen on the mountains of Gelbue. 1 Samuel 31:9 And they turned him, and stripped off his armour, and sent it into the land of the Philistines, sending round glad tidings to their idols and to the people. 1 Samuel 31:10 And they set up his armour at the temple of Astarte, and they fastened his body on the wall of Baethsam. 1 Samuel 31:11 And the inhabitants of Jabis Galaad hear what the Philistines did to Saul. 1 Samuel 31:12 And they rose up, even every man of might, and marched all night, and took the body of Saul and the body of Jonathan his son from the wall of Baethsam; and they bring them to Jabis, and burn them there. 1 Samuel 31:13 And they take their bones, and bury them in the field that is in Jabis, and fast seven days. 2 Samuel 1:1 ¶ And it came to pass after Saul was dead, that David returned from smiting Amalec, and David abode two days in Sekelac. 2 Samuel 1:2 And it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came from the camp, from the people of Saul, and his garments were rent, and earth was upon his head: and it came to pass when he went in to David, that he fell upon the earth, and did obeisance to him. 2 Samuel 1:3 And David said to him, Whence comest thou? and he said to him, I have escaped out of the camp of Israel. 2 Samuel 1:4 And David said to him, What is the matter? tell me. And he said, The people fled out of the battle, and many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead. 2 Samuel 1:5 And David said to the young man who brought him the tidings, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead? 2 Samuel 1:6 And the young man that brought the tidings, said to him, I happened accidentally to be upon mount Gelbue; and, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear, and, behold, the chariots and captains of horse pressed hard upon him. 2 Samuel 1:7 And he looked behind him, and saw me, and called me; and I said, Behold, here am I. 2 Samuel 1:8 And he said to me, Who art thou? and I said, I am an Amalekite. 2 Samuel 1:9 And he said to me, Stand, I pray thee, over me, and slay me, for a dreadful darkness has come upon me, for all my life is in me. 2 Samuel 1:10 So I stood over him and slew him, because I knew he would not live after he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was upon his arm, and I have brought them hither to my lord. 2 Samuel 1:11 ¶ And David laid hold of his garments, and rent them; and all the men who were with him rent their garments. 2 Samuel 1:12 And they lamented, and wept, and fasted till evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Juda, and for the house of Israel, because they were smitten with the sword. 2 Samuel 1:13 And David said to the young man who brought the tidings to him, Whence art thou? and he said, I am the son of an Amalekite sojourner. 2 Samuel 1:14 And David said to him, How was it thou wast not afraid to lift thy hand to destroy the anointed of the Lord? 2 Samuel 1:15 And David called one of his young men, and said, Go and fall upon him: and he smote him, and he died. 2 Samuel 1:16 And David said to him, Thy blood be upon thine own head; for thy mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain the anointed of the Lord. 2 Samuel 1:17 ¶ And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son. 2 Samuel 1:18 And he gave orders to teach it the sons of Juda: behold, it is written in the book of Right. 2 Samuel 1:19 Set up a pillar, O Israel, for the slain that died upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen! 2 Samuel 1:20 Tell it not in Geth, and tell it not as glad tidings in the streets of Ascalon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. 2 Samuel 1:21 Ye mountains of Gelbue, let not dew no rain descend upon you, nor fields of first-fruits be upon you, for there the shield of the mighty ones has been grievously assailed; the shield of Saul was not anointed with oil. 2 Samuel 1:22 From the blood of the slain, and from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan returned not empty; and the sword of Saul turned not back empty. 2 Samuel 1:23 Saul and Jonathan, the beloved and the beautiful, were not divided: comely were they in their life, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, and they were stronger than lions. 2 Samuel 1:24 Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you with scarlet together with your adorning, who added golden ornaments to your apparel. 2 Samuel 1:25 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, even the slain ones upon thy high places! 2 Samuel 1:26 I am grieved for thee, my brother Jonathan; thou wast very lovely to me; thy love to me was wonderful beyond the love of women. 2 Samuel 1:27 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! 2 Samuel 2:1 ¶ And it came to pass after this that David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up into one of the cities of Juda? and the Lord said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? and he said, To Chebron. 2 Samuel 2:2 And David went up thither to Chebron, he and both his wives, Achinaam the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite, 2 Samuel 2:3 and the men that were with him, every one and his family; and they dwelt in the cities of Chebron. 2 Samuel 2:4 And the men of Judea come, and anoint David there to reign over the house of Juda; and they reported to David, saying, The men of Jabis of the country of Galaad have buried Saul. 2 Samuel 2:5 And David sent messengers to the rulers of Jabis of the country of Galaad, and David said to them, Blessed be ye of the Lord, because ye have wrought this mercy toward your lord, even toward Saul the anointed of the Lord, and ye have buried him and Jonathan his son. 2 Samuel 2:6 And now may the Lord deal in mercy and truth towards you: and I also will requite towards you this good deed, because ye have done this. 2 Samuel 2:7 And now let your hands be made strong, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and moreover the house of Juda have anointed me to be king over them. 2 Samuel 2:8 ¶ But Abenner, the son of Ner, the commander-in-chief of Saul's army, took Jebosthe son of Saul, and brought him up from the camp to Manaem 2 Samuel 2:9 and made him king over the land of Galaad, and over Thasiri, and over Jezrael, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. 2 Samuel 2:10 Jebosthe, Saul's son was forty years old, when he reigned over Israel; and he reigned two years, but not over the house of Juda, who followed David. 2 Samuel 2:11 And the days which David reigned in Chebron over the house of Juda were seven years and six months. 2 Samuel 2:12 And Abenner the son of Ner went forth, and the servants of Jebosthe the son of Saul, from Manaem to Gabaon. 2 Samuel 2:13 And Joab the son of Saruia, and the servants of David, went forth from Chebron, and met them at the fountain of Gabaon, at the same place: and these sat down by the fountain on this side, and those by the fountain on that side. 2 Samuel 2:14 And Abenner said to Joab, Let now the young men arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise. 2 Samuel 2:15 And there arose and passed over by number twelve of the children of Benjamin, belonging to Jebosthe the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. 2 Samuel 2:16 And they seized every one the head of his neighbour with his hand, and his sword was thrust into the side of his neighbour, and they fall down together: and the name of that place was called The portion of the treacherous ones, which is in Gabaon. 2 Samuel 2:17 And the battle was very severe on that day; and Abenner and the men of Israel were worsted before the servants of David. 2 Samuel 2:18 ¶ And there were there the three sons of Saruia, Joab, and Abessa, and Asael: and Asael was swift in his feet as a roe in the field. 2 Samuel 2:19 And Asael followed after Abenner, and turned not to go to the right hand or to the left from following Abenner. 2 Samuel 2:20 And Abenner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asael himself? and he said, I am. 2 Samuel 2:21 And Abenner said to him, Turn thou to the right hand or to the left, and lay hold for thyself on one of the young men, and take to thyself his armour: but Asel would not turn back from following him. 2 Samuel 2:22 And Abenner said yet again to Asael, Stand aloof from me, lest I smite thee to the ground? and how should I lift up my face to Joab? 2 Samuel 2:23 And what does this mean? return to Joab thy brother? But he would not stand aloof; and Abenner smites him with the hinder end of the spear on the loins, and the spear went out behind him, and he falls there and dies on the spot: and it came to pass that every one that came to the place where Asael fell and died, stood still. 2 Samuel 2:24 And Joab and Abessa pursued after Abenner, and the sun went down: and they went as far as the hill of Amman, which is in the front of Gai, by the desert way of Gabaon. 2 Samuel 2:25 ¶ And the children of Benjamin who followed Abenner gather themselves together, and they formed themselves into one body, and stood on the top of a hill. 2 Samuel 2:26 And Abenner called Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour perpetually? knowest thou not that it will be bitter at last? How long then wilt thou refuse to tell the people to turn from following our brethren? 2 Samuel 2:27 And Joab said, As the Lord lives, if thou hadst not spoken, even from the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother. 2 Samuel 2:28 And Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the people departed, and did not pursue after Israel, and did not fight any longer. 2 Samuel 2:29 And Abenner and his men departed at evening, and went all that night, and crossed over Jordan, and went along the whole adjacent country, and they come to the camp. 2 Samuel 2:30 And Joab returned from following Abenner, and he assembled all the people, and there were missing of the people of David, nineteen men, and Asael. 2 Samuel 2:31 And the servants of David smote of the children of Benjamin, of the men of Abenner, three hundred and sixty men belonging to him. 2 Samuel 2:32 And they take up Asael, and bury him in the tomb of his father in Bethleem. And Joab and the men with him went all the night, and the morning rose upon them in Chebron. 2 Samuel 3:1 ¶ And there was war for a long time between the house of Saul and the house of David; and the house of David grew continually stronger; but the house of Saul grew continually weaker. 2 Samuel 3:2 And sons were born to David in Chebron: and his first-born was Ammon the son of Achinoom the Jezraelitess. 2 Samuel 3:3 And his second son was Daluia, the son of Abigaia the Carmelitess; and the third, Abessalom the son of Maacha the daughter of Tholmi the king of Gessir. 2 Samuel 3:4 And the fourth was Ornia, the son of Aggith, and the fifth was Saphatia, the son of Abital. 2 Samuel 3:5 And the sixth was Jetheraam, the son of Aegal the wife of David. These were born to David in Chebron. 2 Samuel 3:6 And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abenner was governing the house of Saul. 2 Samuel 3:7 ¶ And Saul had a concubine, Respha, the daughter of Jol; and Jebosthe the son of Saul said to Abenner, Why hast thou gone in to my father's concubine? 2 Samuel 3:8 And Abenner was very angry with Jebosthe for this saying; and Abenner said to him, Am I a dog's head? I have this day wrought kindness with the house of Saul thy father, and with his brethren and friends, and have not gone over to the house of David, and dost thou this day seek a charge against me concerning injury to a woman? 2 Samuel 3:9 God do thus and more also to Abenner, if as the Lord swore to David, so do I not to him this day; 2 Samuel 3:10 to take away the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to raise up the throne of David over Israel and over Juda from Dan to Bersabee. 2 Samuel 3:11 And Jebosthe could not any longer answer Abenner a word, because he feared him. 2 Samuel 3:12 And Abenner sent messengers to David to Thaelam where he was, immediately, saying, Make thy covenant with me, and, behold, my hand is with thee to bring back to thee all the house of Israel. 2 Samuel 3:13 And David said, With a good will I will make with thee a covenant: only I demand one condition of thee, saying, Thou shalt not see my face, unless thou bring Melchol the daughter of Saul, when thou comest to see my face. 2 Samuel 3:14 And David sent messengers to Jebosthe the son of Saul, saying, Restore me my wife Melchol, whom I took for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines. 2 Samuel 3:15 And Jebosthe sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Selle. 2 Samuel 3:16 And her husband went with her weeping behind her as far as Barakim. And Abenner said to him, Go, return; and he returned. 2 Samuel 3:17 And Abenner spoke to the elders of Israel, saying, In former days ye sought David to reign over you; 2 Samuel 3:18 and now perform it: for the Lord has spoken concerning David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save Israel out of the hand of all their enemies. 2 Samuel 3:19 And Abenner spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abenner went to speak in the ears of David at Chebron, all that seemed good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of the house of Benjamin. 2 Samuel 3:20 And Abenner came to David to Chebron, and with him twenty men: and David made for Abenner and his men with him a banquet of wine. 2 Samuel 3:21 And Abenner said to David, I will arise now, and go, and gather to my lord the king all Israel; and I will make with him a covenant, and thou shalt reign over all whom thy soul desires. And David sent away Abenner, and he departed in peace. 2 Samuel 3:22 ¶ And, behold, the servants of David and Joab arrived from their expedition, and they brought much spoil with them: and Abenner was not with David in Chebron, because he had sent him away, and he had departed in peace. 2 Samuel 3:23 And Joab and all his army came, and it was reported to Joab, saying, Abenner the son of Ner is come to David, and David has let him go, and he has departed in peace. 2 Samuel 3:24 And Joab went in to the king, and said, What is this that thou hast done? behold, Abenner came to thee; and why hast thou let him go, and he has departed in peace? 2 Samuel 3:25 Knowest thou not the mischief of Abenner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all things that thou doest? 2 Samuel 3:26 And Joab returned from David, and sent messengers to Abenner after him; and they bring him back from the well of Seiram: but David knew it not. 2 Samuel 3:27 And he brought back Abenner to Chebron, and Joab caused him to turn aside from the gate to speak to him, laying wait for him: and he smote him there in the loins, and he died for the blood of Asael the brother of Joab. 2 Samuel 3:28 And David heard of it afterwards, and said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord even for ever of the blood of Abenner the son of Ner. 2 Samuel 3:29 Let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all the house of his father; and let there not be wanting of the house of Joab one that has an issue, or a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls by the sword, or that wants bread. 2 Samuel 3:30 For Joab and Abessa his brother laid wait continually for Abenner, because he slew Asael their brother at Gabaon in the battle. 2 Samuel 3:31 And David said to Joab and to all the people with him, Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament before Abenner. And king David followed the bier. 2 Samuel 3:32 And they bury Abenner in Chebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at his tomb, and all the people wept for Abenner. 2 Samuel 3:33 And the king mourned over Abenner, and said, Shall Abenner die according to the death of Nabal? 2 Samuel 3:34 Thy hands were not bound, and thy feet were not put in fetters: one brought thee not near as Nabal; thou didst fall before children of iniquity. 2 Samuel 3:35 And all the people assembled to weep for him. And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day: and David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I eat bread or any thing else before the sun goes down. 2 Samuel 3:36 And all the people took notice, and all things that the king did before the people were pleasing in their sight. 2 Samuel 3:37 So all the people and all Israel perceived in that day, that it was not of the king to slay Abenner the son of Ner. 2 Samuel 3:38 And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that a great prince is this day fallen in Israel? 2 Samuel 3:39 And that I am this day a mere kinsman of his, and as it were a subject; but these men the sons of Saruia are too hard for me: the Lord reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness. 2 Samuel 4:1 ¶ And Jebosthe the son of Saul heard that Abenner the son of Ner had died in Chebron; and his hands were paralyzed, and all the men of Israel grew faint. 2 Samuel 4:2 And Jebosthe the son of Saul had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baana, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Remmon the Berothite of the children of Benjamin; for Beroth was reckoned to the children of Benjamin. 2 Samuel 4:3 And the Berothites ran away to Gethaim, and were sojourners there until this day. 2 Samuel 4:4 And Jonathan Saul's son had a son lame of his feet, five years old, and he was in the way when the news of Saul and Jonathan his son came from Jezrael, and his nurse took him up, and fled; and it came to pass as he hasted and retreated, that he fell, and was lamed. And his name was Memphibosthe. 2 Samuel 4:5 And Rechab and Baana the sons of Remmon the Berothite went, and they came in the heat of the day into the house of Jebosthe; and he was sleeping on a bed at noon. 2 Samuel 4:6 And, behold, the porter of the house winnowed wheat, and he slumbered and slept: and the brothers Rechab and Baana went privily into the house: 2 Samuel 4:7 And Jebosthe was sleeping on his bed in his chamber: and they smite him, and slay him, and take off his head: and they took his head, and went all the night by the western road. 2 Samuel 4:8 And they brought the head of Jebosthe to David to Chebron, and they said to the king, Behold the head of Jebosthe the son of Saul thy enemy, who sought thy life; and the Lord has executed for my lord the king vengeance on his enemies, as it is this day: even on Saul thy enemy, and on his seed. 2 Samuel 4:9 ¶ And David answered and Rechab and Baana his brother, the sons of Remmon the Berothite, and said to them, As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all affliction; 2 Samuel 4:10 he that reported to me that Saul was dead, even he was as one bringing glad tidings before me: but I seized him and slew him in Sekelac, to whom I ought, as he thought, to have given a reward for his tidings. 2 Samuel 4:11 And now evil men have slain a righteous men in his house on his bed: now then I will require his blood of your hand, and I will destroy you from off the earth. 2 Samuel 4:12 And David commanded his young men, and they slay them, and cut off their hands and their feet; and they hung them up at the fountain in Chebron: and they buried the head of Jebosthe in the tomb of Abenezer the son of Ner. 2 Samuel 5:1 ¶ And all the tribes of Israel come to David to Chebron, and they said to him, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. 2 Samuel 5:2 And heretofore Saul being king over us, thou was he that didst lead out and bring in Israel: and the Lord said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be for a leader to my people Israel. 2 Samuel 5:3 And all the elders of Israel come to the king to Chebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Chebron before the Lord; and they anoint David king over all Israel. 2 Samuel 5:4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. 2 Samuel 5:5 Seven years and six months he reigned in Chebron over Juda, and thirty-three years he reigned over all Israel and Juda in Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 5:6 ¶ And David and his men, departed to Jerusalem, to the Jebusite that inhabited the land: and it was said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither: for the blind and the lame withstood him, saying, David shall not come in hither. 2 Samuel 5:7 And David took first the hold of Sion: this is the city of David. 2 Samuel 5:8 And David said on that day, Every one that smites the Jebusite, let him attack with the dagger both the lame and the blind, and those that hate the soul of David. Therefore they say, The lame and the blind shall not enter into the house of the Lord. 2 Samuel 5:9 And David dwelt in the hold, and it was called the city of David, and he built the city itself round about from the citadel, and he built his own house. 2 Samuel 5:10 And David advanced and became great, and the Lord Almighty was with him. 2 Samuel 5:11 ¶ And Chiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar wood, and carpenters, and stone- masons: and they built a house for David. 2 Samuel 5:12 And David knew that the Lord had prepared him to be king over Israel, and that his kingdom was exalted for the sake of his people Israel. 2 Samuel 5:13 And David took again wives and concubines out of Jerusalem, after he came from Chebron: and David had still more sons and daughters born to him. 2 Samuel 5:14 And these are the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Sammus, and Sobab, and Nathan, and Solomon. 2 Samuel 5:15 And Ebear, and Elisue, and Naphec, and Jephies. 2 Samuel 5:16"

And David went, and brought up the Ark of the Lord from the house of Abeddara to the city of David with gladness. 2 Samuel 6:13 And there were with him bearing the ark seven bands, and for a sacrifice a calf and lambs. 2 Samuel 6:14 And David sounded with well-tuned instruments before the Lord, and David was clothed with a fine long robe. 2 Samuel 6:15 And David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet. 2 Samuel 6:16 And it came to pass as the ark arrived at the city of David, that Melchol the daughter of Saul looked through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart. 2 Samuel 6:17 And they bring the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle which David pitched for it: and David offered whole-burnt-offerings before the Lord, and peace-offerings. 2 Samuel 6:18 And David made an end of offering the whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and blessed the people in the name of the Lord of Hosts. 2 Samuel 6:19 And he distributed to all the people, even to all the host of Israel from Dan to Bersabee, both men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a joint of meat, and a cake from the frying-pan: and all the people departed every one to his home. 2 Samuel 6:20 ¶ And David returned to bless his house. And Melchol the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and saluted him, and said, How was the king of Israel glorified to-day, who was to-day uncovered in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the dancers wantonly uncovers himself! 2 Samuel 6:21 And David said to Melchol, I will dance before the Lord. Blessed be the Lord who chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to make me head over his people, even over Israel: therefore I will play, and dance before the Lord. 2 Samuel 6:22 And I will again uncover myself thus, and I will be vile in thine eyes, and with the maid-servants by whom thou saidst that I was not had in honour. 2 Samuel 6:23 And Melchol the daughter of Saul had no child till the day of her death. 2 Samuel 7:1 ¶ And it came to pass when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given him an inheritance on every side free from all his enemies round about him; 2 Samuel 7:2 that the king said to Nathan the prophet, Behold now, I live in a house of cedar, and the ark of the Lord dwells in the midst of a tent. 2 Samuel 7:3 And Nathan said to the king, Go and do all that is in thine heart, for the Lord is with thee. 2 Samuel 7:4 ¶ And it came to pass in that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying, 2 Samuel 7:5 Go, and say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord, Thou shalt not build me a house for me to dwell in. 2 Samuel 7:6 For I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt to this day, but I have been walking in a lodge and in a tent, 2 Samuel 7:7 wheresoever I went with all Israel. Have I ever spoken to any of the tribes of Israel, which I commanded to tend my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of Cedar? 2 Samuel 7:8 And now thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord Almighty, I took thee from the sheep-cote, that thou shouldest be a prince over my people, over Israel. 2 Samuel 7:9 And I was with thee wheresoever thou wentest, and I destroyed all thine enemies before thee, and I made thee renowned according to the renown of the great ones on the earth. 2 Samuel 7:10 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell by themselves, and shall be no more distressed; and the son of iniquity shall no more afflict them, as he has done from the beginning, 2 Samuel 7:11 from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel: and I will give thee rest from all thine enemies, and the Lord will tell thee that thou shalt build a house to him. 2 Samuel 7:12 And it shall come to pass when thy days shall have been fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, even thine own issue, and I will establish his kingdom. 2 Samuel 7:13 He shall build for me a house to my name, and I will set up his throne even for ever. 2 Samuel 7:14 I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. And when he happens to transgress, then will I chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men. 2 Samuel 7:15 But my mercy I will not take from him, as I took it from those whom I removed from my presence. 2 Samuel 7:16 And his house shall be made sure, and his kingdom for ever before me, and his throne shall be set up for ever. 2 Samuel 7:17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David. 2 Samuel 7:18 ¶ And king David came in, and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord, my Lord, and what is my house, that thou hast loved me hitherto? 2 Samuel 7:19 Whereas I was very little before thee, O Lord, my Lord, yet thou spokest concerning the house of thy servant for a long time to to come. And is this the law of man, O Lord, my Lord? 2 Samuel 7:20 And what shall David yet say to thee? and now thou knowest thy servant, O Lord, my Lord. 2 Samuel 7:21 And thou hast wrought for thy servant's sake, and according to thy heart thou hast wrought all this greatness, to make it known to thy servant, 2 Samuel 7:22 that he may magnify thee, O my Lord; for there is no one like thee, and there is no God, but thou among all of whom we have heard with our ears. 2 Samuel 7:23 And what other nation in the earth is as thy people Israel? whereas God was his guide, to redeem for himself a people to make thee a name, to do mightily and nobly, so that thou shouldest cast out nations an their tabernacles from the presence of thy people, whom thou didst redeem for thyself out of Egypt? 2 Samuel 7:24 And thou has prepared for thyself thy people Israel to be a people for ever, and thou, Lord, art become their God. 2 Samuel 7:25 And now, O my Lord, the Almighty Lord God of Israel, confirm the word for ever which thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and his house: and now as thou hast said, 2 Samuel 7:26 Let thy name be magnified for ever. 2 Samuel 7:27 Almighty Lord God of Israel, thou hast uncovered the ear of thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore thy servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to thee. 2 Samuel 7:28 And now, O Lord my Lord, thou art God; and thy words will be true, and thou hast spoken these good things concerning thy servant. 2 Samuel 7:29 And now begin and bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord, my Lord, hast spoken, and the house of thy servant shall be blessed with thy blessing so as to continue for ever. 2 Samuel 8:1 ¶ And it came to pass after this, that David smote the Philistines, and put them to flight, and David took the tribute from out of the hand of the Philistines. 2 Samuel 8:2 And David smote Moab, and measured them out with lines, having laid them down on the ground: and there were two lines for slaying, and two lines he kept alive: and Moab became servants to David, yielding tribute. 2 Samuel 8:3 And David smote Adraazar the son of Raab king of Suba, as he went to extend his power to the river Euphrates. 2 Samuel 8:4 And David took a thousand of his chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all his chariot horses, and he reserved to himself a hundred chariots. 2 Samuel 8:5 And Syria of Damascus comes to help Adraazar king of Suba, and David smote twenty-two thousand men belonging to the Syrian. 2 Samuel 8:6 And David placed a garrison in Syria near Damascus, and the Syrians became servants and tributaries to David: and the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went. 2 Samuel 8:7 And David took the golden bracelets which were on the servants of Adraazar king of Suba, and brought them to Jerusalem. And Susakim king of Egypt took them, when he went up to Jerusalem in the days of Roboam son of Solomon. 2 Samuel 8:8 And king David took from Metebac, and from the choice cities of Adraazar, very much brass: with that Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the lavers, and all the furniture. 2 Samuel 8:9 ¶ And Thou the king of Hemath heard that David had smitten all the host of Adraazar. 2 Samuel 8:10 And Thou sent Jedduram his son to king David, to ask him of his welfare, and to congratulate him on his fighting against Adraazar and smiting him, for he was an enemy to Adraazar: and in his hands were vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass. 2 Samuel 8:11 And these king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and with the gold which he consecrated out of all the cities which he conquered, 2 Samuel 8:12 out of Idumea, and out of Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalec, and from the spoils of Adraazar son of Raab king of Suba. 2 Samuel 8:13 And David made himself a name: and when he returned he smote Idumea in Gebelem to the number of eighteen thousand. 2 Samuel 8:14 And he set garrisons in Idumea, even in all Idumea: and all the Idumeans were servants to the king. And the Lord preserved David wherever he went. 2 Samuel 8:15 ¶ And David reigned over all Israel: and David wrought judgment and justice over all his people. 2 Samuel 8:16 And Joab the son of Saruia was over the host; and Josaphat the son of Achilud was keeper of the records. 2 Samuel 8:17 And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and Achimelech son of Abiathar, were priests; and Sasa was the scribe, 2 Samuel 8:18 and Banaeas son of Jodae was councillor, and the Chelethite and the Phelethite, and the sons of David, were princes of the court. 2 Samuel 9:1 ¶ And David said, Is there yet any one left in the house of Saul, that I may deal kindly with him for Jonathan's sake? 2 Samuel 9:2 And there was a servant of the house of Saul, and his name was Siba: and they call him to David; and the king said to him, Art thou Siba? and he said, I am thy servant. 2 Samuel 9:3 And the king said, Is there yet a man left of the house of Saul, that I may act towards him with the mercy of God? and Siba said to the king, There is yet a son of Jonathan, lame of his feet. 2 Samuel 9:4 And the king said, Where is he? and Siba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Amiel of Lodabar. 2 Samuel 9:5 And king David went, and took him out of the house of Machir the son Amiel of Lodabar. 2 Samuel 9:6 And Memphibosthe the son of Jonathan the son of Saul comes to the king David, and he fell upon his face and did obeisance to him: and David said to him, Memphibosthe: and he said, Behold thy servant. 2 Samuel 9:7 And David said to him, Fear not, for I will surely deal mercifully with thee for the sake of Jonathan thy father, and I will restore to thee all the land of Saul the father of thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. 2 Samuel 9:8 And Memphibosthe did obeisance, and said, Who am I thy servant, that thou hast looked upon a dead dog like me? 2 Samuel 9:9 ¶ And the king called Siba the servant of Saul, and said to him, All that belonged to Saul and to all his house have I given to the son of thy lord. 2 Samuel 9:10 And thou, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him; and thou shalt bring in bread to the son of thy lord, and he shall eat bread: and Memphibosthe the son of thy lord shall eat bread continually at my table. Now Siba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 2 Samuel 9:11 And Siba said to the king, According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so will thy servant do. And Memphibosthe did eat at the table of David, as one of the sons of the king. 2 Samuel 9:12 And Memphibosthe had a little son, and his name was Micha: and all the household of Siba were servants to Memphibosthe. 2 Samuel 9:13 And Memphibosthe dwelt in Jerusalem, for he continually ate at the table of the king; and he was lame in both his feet. 2 Samuel 10:1 ¶ And it came to pass after this that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Annon his son reigned in his stead. 2 Samuel 10:2 And David said, I will shew mercy to Annon the son of Naas, as his father dealt mercifully with me. And David sent to comfort him concerning his father by the hand of his servants; and the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon. 2 Samuel 10:3 And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Annon their lord, Is it to honour thy father before thee that David has sent comforters to thee? Has not David rather sent his servants to thee that they should search the city, and spy it out and examine it? 2 Samuel 10:4 And Annon took the servants of David, and shaved their beards, and cut off their garments in the midst as far as their haunches, and sent them away. 2 Samuel 10:5 And they brought David word concerning the men; and he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly dishonoured: and the king said, Remain in Jericho till your beards have grown, and then ye shall return. 2 Samuel 10:6 ¶ And the children of Ammon saw that the people of David were ashamed; and the children of Ammon sent, and hired the Syrians of Baethraam, and the Syrians of Suba, and Roob, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Amalec with a thousand men, and Istob with twelve thousand men. 2 Samuel 10:7 And David heard, and sent Joab and all his host, even the mighty men. 2 Samuel 10:8 And the children of Ammon went forth, and set the battle in array by the door of the gate: those of Syria, Suba, and Roob, and Istob, and Amalec, being by themselves in the field. 2 Samuel 10:9 And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him from that which was opposed in front and from behind, and he chose out some of all the young men of Israel, and they set themselves in array against Syria. 2 Samuel 10:10 And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of Abessa his brother, and they set the battle in array opposite to the children of Ammon. 2 Samuel 10:11 And he said, If Syria be too strong for me, then shall ye help me: and if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then will we be ready to help thee. 2 Samuel 10:12 Be thou courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the sake of the cities of our God, and the Lord shall do that which is good in his eyes. 2 Samuel 10:13 And Joab and his people with him advanced to battle against Syria, and they fled from before him. 2 Samuel 10:14 And the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, and they fled from before Abessa, and entered into the city: and Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 10:15 ¶ And the Syrians saw that they were worsted before Israel, and they gathered themselves together. 2 Samuel 10:16 And Adraazar sent and gathered the Syrians from the other side of the river Chalamak, and they came to Aelam; and Sobac the captain of the host of Adraazar was at their head. 2 Samuel 10:17 And it was reported to David, and he gathered all Israel, and went over Jordan, and came to Aelam: and the Syrians set the battle in array against David, and fought with him. 2 Samuel 10:18 And Syria fled from before Israel, and David destroyed of Syria seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and he smote Sobac the captain of his host, and he died there. 2 Samuel 10:19 And all the kings the servants of Adraazar saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, and they went over to Israel, and served them: and Syria was afraid to help the children of Ammon any more. 2 Samuel 11:1 ¶ And it came to pass when the time o the year for kings going out to battle had come round, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbath: but David remained at Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 11:2 And it came to pass toward evening, that David arose off his couch, and walked on the roof of the king's house, and saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon. 2 Samuel 11:3 And David sent and enquired about the woman: and one said, Is not this Bersabee the daughter of Eliab, the wife of Urias the Chettite? 2 Samuel 11:4 And David sent messengers, and took her, and went in to her, and he lay with her: and she was purified from her uncleanness, and returned to her house. 2 Samuel 11:5 And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child. 2 Samuel 11:6 ¶ And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Urias the Chettite; and Joab sent Urias to David. 2 Samuel 11:7 And Urias arrived and went in to him, and David asked him how Joab was, and how the people were, and how the war went on. 2 Samuel 11:8 And David said to Urias, Go to thy house, and wash thy feet: and Urias departed from the house of the king, and a portion of meat from the king followed him. 2 Samuel 11:9 And Urias slept at the door of the king with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house. 2 Samuel 11:10 And they brought David word, saying, Urias has not gone down to his house. And David said to Urias, Art thou not come from a journey? why hast thou not gone down to thy house? 2 Samuel 11:11 And Urias said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Juda dwell in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; and shall I go into my house to eat and drink, and lie with my wife? how should I do this? as thy soul lives, I will not do this thing. 2 Samuel 11:12 And David said to Urias, Remain here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee go. So Urias remained in Jerusalem that day and the day following. 2 Samuel 11:13 And David called him, and he ate before him and drank, and he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening to lie upon his bed with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house. 2 Samuel 11:14 ¶ And the morning came, and David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Urias. 2 Samuel 11:15 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Station Urias in front of the severe part of the fight, and retreat from behind him, so shall he be wounded and die. 2 Samuel 11:16 And it came to pass while Joab was watching against the city, that he set Urias in a place where he knew that valiant men were. 2 Samuel 11:17 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and some of the people of the servants of David fell, and Urias the Chettite died also. 2 Samuel 11:18 And Joab sent, and reported to David all the events of the war, so as to tell them to the king. 2 Samuel 11:19 And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast finished reporting all the events of the war to the king, 2 Samuel 11:20 then it shall come to pass if the anger of the king shall arise, and he shall say to thee, Why did ye draw nigh to the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from off the wall? 2 Samuel 11:21 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerobaal son of Ner? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from above the wall, and he died in Thamasi? why did ye draw near to the wall? then thou shalt say, Thy servant Urias the Chettite is also dead. 2 Samuel 11:22 And the messenger of Joab went to the king to Jerusalem, and he came and reported to David all that Joab told him, all the affairs of the war. And David was very angry with Joab, and said to the messenger, Why did ye draw nigh to the wall to fight? knew ye not that ye would be wounded from off the wall? Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerobaal? did not a woman cast upon him a piece of millstone from the wall, and he died in Thamasi? why did ye draw near to the wall? 2 Samuel 11:23 And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and they came out against us into the field, and we came upon them even to the door of the gate. 2 Samuel 11:24 And the archers shot at thy servants from off the wall, and some of the king's servants died, and thy servant Urias the Chettite is dead also. 2 Samuel 11:25 And David said to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let not the matter be grievous in thine eyes, for the sword devours one way at one time and another way at another: strengthen thine array against the city, and destroy it, and strengthen him. 2 Samuel 11:26 And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and she mourned for her husband. 2 Samuel 11:27 And the time of mourning expired, and David sent and took her into his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son: but the thing which David did was evil in the eyes of the Lord. 2 Samuel 12:1 ¶ And the Lord sent Nathan the prophet to David; and he went in to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor. 2 Samuel 12:2 And the rich man had very many flocks and herds. 2 Samuel 12:3 But the poor man had only one little ewe lamb, which he had purchased, and preserved, and reared; an it grew up with himself and his children in common; it ate of his bread and drank of his cup, and slept in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter. 2 Samuel 12:4 And a traveller came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his flocks and of his herds, to dress for the traveller that came to him; and he took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that came to him. 2 Samuel 12:5 And David was greatly moved with anger against the man; and David said to Nathan, As the Lord lives, the man that did this thing shall surely die. 2 Samuel 12:6 And he shall restore the lamb seven-fold, because he has not spared. 2 Samuel 12:7 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man that has done this. Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I anointed thee to be king over Israel, and I rescued thee out the hand of Saul; 2 Samuel 12:8 and I gave thee the house of thy lord, and the wives of thy lord into thy bosom, and I gave to thee the house of Israel and Juda; and if that had been little, I would have given thee yet more. 2 Samuel 12:9 Why hast thou set at nought the word of the Lord, to do that which is evil in his eyes? thou hast slain Urias the Chettite with the sword, and thou hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and thou hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. 2 Samuel 12:10 Now therefore the sword shall not depart from thy house for ever, because thou has set me at nought, and thou hast taken the wife of Urias the Chettite, to be thy wife. 2 Samuel 12:11 Thus says the Lord, Behold, I will raise up against thee evil out of thy house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and will give them to thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. 2 Samuel 12:12 For thou didst it secretly, but I will do this thing in the sight of all Israel, and before the sun. 2 Samuel 12:13 And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said to David, And the Lord has put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. 2 Samuel 12:14 Only because thou hast given great occasion of provocation to the enemies of the Lord by this thing, thy son also that is born to thee shall surely die. 2 Samuel 12:15 ¶ And Nathan departed to his house. And the Lord smote the child, which the wife of Urias the Chettite bore to David, and it was ill. 2 Samuel 12:16 And David enquired of God concerning the child, and David fasted, and went in and lay all night upon the ground. 2 Samuel 12:17 And the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the ground, but he would not rise, nor did he eat bread with them. 2 Samuel 12:18 And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died: and the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive we spoke to him, and he hearkened not to our voice; and thou should we tell him that the child is dead?-so would he do himself harm. 2 Samuel 12:19 And David understood that his servants were whispering, and David perceived that the child was dead: and David said to his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, He is dead. 2 Samuel 12:20 Then David rose up from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his raiment, and went into the house of God, and worshipped him; and went into his own house, and called for bread to eat, and they set bread before him and he ate. 2 Samuel 12:21 And his servants said to him, What is this thing that thou hast done concerning the child? while it was yet living thou didst fast, and weep, and watch: and when the child was dead thou didst rise up, and didst eat bread, and drink. 2 Samuel 12:22 And David said, While the child yet lived, I fasted and wept; for I said, Who knows if the Lord will pity me, and the child live? 2 Samuel 12:23 But now it is dead, why should I fast thus? shall I be able to bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. 2 Samuel 12:24 And David comforted Bersabee his wife, and he went in to her, and lay with her; and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his named Solomon, and the Lord loved him. 2 Samuel 12:25 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called his name Jeddedi, for the Lord's sake. 2 Samuel 12:26 ¶ And Joab fought against Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. 2 Samuel 12:27 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbath, and taken the city of waters. 2 Samuel 12:28 And now gather the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, an take it beforehand; lest I take the city first, and my name be called upon it. 2 Samuel 12:29 And David gathered all the people, and went to Rabbath, and fought against it, and took it. 2 Samuel 12:30 And he took the crown of Molchom their king from off his head, and the weight of it was a talent of gold, with precious stones, and it was upon the head of David; and he carried forth very much spoil of the city. 2 Samuel 12:31 And he brought forth the people that were in it, and put them under the saw, and under iron harrows, and axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus he did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 13:1 ¶ And it happened after this that Abessalom the son of David had a very beautiful sister, and her name was Themar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. 2 Samuel 13:2 And Amnon was distressed even to sickness, because of Themar his sister; for she was a virgin, and it seemed very difficult for Amnon to do anything to her. 2 Samuel 13:3 And Amnon had a friend, and his name was Jonadab, the son of Samaa the brother of David: and Jonadab was a very cunning man. 2 Samuel 13:4 And he said to him, What ails thee that thou art thus weak? O son of the king, morning by morning? wilt thou not tell me? and Ammon said, I love Themar the sister of my brother Abessalom. 2 Samuel 13:5 And Jonadab said to him, Lie upon thy bed, and make thyself sick, and thy father shall come in to see thee; and thou shalt say to him, Let, I pray thee, Themar my sister come, and feed me with morsels, and let her prepare food before my eyes, that I may see and eat at her hands. 2 Samuel 13:6 So Ammon lay down, and made himself sick; and the king came in to see him: and Amnon said to the king, Let, I pray thee, my sister Themar come to me, and make a couple of cakes in my sight, and I will eat them at her hand. 2 Samuel 13:7 And David sent to Themar to the house, saying, Go now to thy brother's house, and dress him food. 2 Samuel 13:8 And Themar went to the house of her brother Amnon, and he was lying down: and she took the dough and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes. 2 Samuel 13:9 And she took the frying pan and poured them out before him, but he would not eat. And Amnon said, Send out every man from about me. And they removed every man from about him. 2 Samuel 13:10 And Amnon said to Themar, Bring in the food into the closet, and I will eat of thy hand. And Themar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them to her brother Amnon into the chamber. 2 Samuel 13:11 And she brought them to him to eat, and he caught hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister. 2 Samuel 13:12 And she said to him, Nay, my brother, do not humble me, for it ought not to be so done in Israel; do not this folly. 2 Samuel 13:13 And I, whither shall I remove my reproach? and thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. And now, speak, I pray thee, to the king, for surely he will not keep me from thee. 2 Samuel 13:14 But Amnon would not hearken to her voice; and he prevailed against her, and humbled her, and lay with her. 2 Samuel 13:15 Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her, for the last wickedness was greater than the first: and Amnon said to her, Rise, and be gone. 2 Samuel 13:16 And Themar spoke to him concerning this great mischief, greater, said she, than the other that thou didst me, to send me away: but Amnon would not hearken to her voice. 2 Samuel 13:17 And he called his servant who had charge of the house, and said to him, Put now this woman out from me, and shut the door after her. 2 Samuel 13:18 And she had on her a variegated robe, for so were the king's daughters that were virgins attired in their apparel: and his servant led her forth, and shut the door after her. 2 Samuel 13:19 And Themar took ashes, and put them on her head; and she rent the variegated garment that was upon her: and she laid her hands on her head, and went crying continually. 2 Samuel 13:20 And Abessalom her brother said to her, Has thy brother Amnon been with thee? now then, my sister, be silent, for he is thy brother: be not careful to mention this matter. So Themar dwelt as a widow in the house of her brother Abessalom. 2 Samuel 13:21 ¶ And king David heard of all these things, and was very angry; but he did not grieve the spirit of his son Amnon, because be loved him, for he was his first-born. 2 Samuel 13:22 And Abessalom spoke not to Amnon, good or bad, because Abessalom hated Amnon, on account of his humbling his sister Themar. 2 Samuel 13:23 And it came to pass at the end of two whole years, that they were shearing sheep for Abessalom in Belasor near Ephraim: and Abessalom invited all the king's sons. 2 Samuel 13:24 And Abessalom came to the king, and said, Behold, thy servant has a sheep-shearing; let now the king and his servants go with thy servant. 2 Samuel 13:25 And the king said to Abessalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, and let us not be burdensome to thee. And he pressed him; but he would not go, but blessed him. 2 Samuel 13:26 And Abessalom said to him, And if not, let I pray thee, my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee? 2 Samuel 13:27 And Abessalom pressed him, and he sent with him Amnon and all the king's sons; and Abessalom made a banquet like the banquet of the king. 2 Samuel 13:28 And Abessalom charged his servants, saying, Mark when the heart of Amnon shall be merry with wine, and I shall say to you, Smite Amnon, and slay him: fear not; for is it not I that command you? Be courageous, and be valiant. 2 Samuel 13:29 And the servants of Abessalom did to Amnon as Abessalom commanded them: and all the sons of the king rose up, and they mounted every man his mule, and fled. 2 Samuel 13:30 ¶ And it came to pass, when they were in the way, that a report came to David, saying, Abessalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left. 2 Samuel 13:31 Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay upon the ground: and all his servants that were standing round him rent their garments. 2 Samuel 13:32 And Jonadab the son of Samaa brother of David, answered and said, Let not my Lord the king say that he has slain all the young men the sons of the king, for Amnon only of them all is dead; for he was appointed to death by the mouth of Abessalom from the day that he humbled his sister Themar. 2 Samuel 13:33 And now let not my lord the king take the matter to heart, saying, All the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only of them is dead. 2 Samuel 13:34 And Abessalom escaped: and the young man the watchman, lifted up his eyes, and looked; and, behold, much people went in the way behind him from the side of the mountain in the descent: and the watchman came and told the king, and said, I have seen men by the way of Oronen, by the side of the mountain. 2 Samuel 13:35 And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons are present: according to the word of thy servant, so has it happened. 2 Samuel 13:36 And it came to pass when he had finished speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voices and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept with a very great weeping. 2 Samuel 13:37 But Abessalom fled, and went to Tholmi son of Emiud the king of Gedsur to the land of Chamaachad: and king David mourned for his son continually. 2 Samuel 13:38 So Abessalom fled, and departed to Gedsur, and was there three years. 2 Samuel 13:39 And king David ceased to go out after Abessalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, touching his death. 2 Samuel 14:1 ¶ And Joab the son of Saruia knew that the heart of the king was toward Abessalom. 2 Samuel 14:2 And Joab sent to Thecoe, and took thence a cunning woman, and said to her, Mourn, I pray thee, and put on mourning apparel, and anoint thee not with oil, and thou shalt be as a woman mourning for one that is dead thus for many days. 2 Samuel 14:3 And thou shalt go to the king, and speak to him according to this word. And Joab put the words in her mouth. 2 Samuel 14:4 So the woman of Thecoe went in to the king and fell upon her face to the earth, and did him obeisance, and said, Help, O king, help. 2 Samuel 14:5 And the king said to her, What is the matter with thee? And she said, I am indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead. 2 Samuel 14:6 And moreover thy handmaid had two sons, and they fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them; and the one smote the other his brother, and slew him. 2 Samuel 14:7 And behold the whole family rose up against thine handmaid, and they said, Give up the one that smote his brother, and we will put him to death for the life of his brother, whom he slew, and we will take away even your heir: so they will quench my coal that is left, so as not to leave my husband remnant or name on the face of the earth. 2 Samuel 14:8 And the king said to the woman, Go in peace to thy house, and I will give commandment concerning thee. 2 Samuel 14:9 And the woman of Thecoe said to the king, On me, my lord, O king, and on my father's house be the iniquity, and the king and his throne be guiltless. 2 Samuel 14:10 And the king said, Who was it that spoke to thee? thou shalt even bring him to me, and one shall not touch him any more. 2 Samuel 14:11 And she said, Let now the king remember concerning his Lord God in that the avenger of blood is multiplied to destroy, and let them not take away my son. And he said, As the lord lives, not a hair of thy son shall fall to the ground. 2 Samuel 14:12 And the woman said, Let now thy servant speak a word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on. 2 Samuel 14:13 And the woman said, Why hast thou devised this thing against the people of God? or is this word out of the king's mouth as a transgression, so that the king should not bring back his banished? 2 Samuel 14:14 For we shall surely die, and be as water poured upon the earth, which shall not be gathered up, and God shall take the life, even as he devises to thrust forth from him his outcast. 2 Samuel 14:15 And now whereas I came to speak this word to my lord the king, the reason is that the people will see me, and thy handmaid will say, Let one now speak to my lord the king, if peradventure the king will perform the request of his handmaid; 2 Samuel 14:16 for the king will hear. Let him rescue his handmaid out of the hand of the man that seeks to cast out me and my son from the inheritance of God. 2 Samuel 14:17 And the woman said, If now the word of my lord the king be gracious,-well: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king, to hear good and evil: and the Lord thy God shall be with thee. 2 Samuel 14:18 And the king answered, and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the matter which I ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king by all means speak. 2 Samuel 14:19 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab in all this matter with thee? and the woman said to the king, As thy soul lives, my lord, O king, there is no turning to the right hand or to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken; for thy servant Joab himself charged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid. 2 Samuel 14:20 In order that this form of speech might come about it was that thy servant Joab has framed this matter: and my lord is wise as is the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth. 2 Samuel 14:21 ¶ And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done to thee according to this thy word: go, bring back the young man Abessalom. 2 Samuel 14:22 And Joab fell on his face to the ground, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To- day thy servant knows that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, for my lord the king has performed the request of his servant. 2 Samuel 14:23 And Joab arose, and went to Gedsur, and brought Abessalom to Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 14:24 And the king said, Let him return to his house, and not see my face. And Abessalom returned to his house, and saw not the king's face. 2 Samuel 14:25 And there was not a man in Israel so very comely as Abessalom: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 2 Samuel 14:26 And when he polled his head, (and it was at the beginning of every year that he polled it, because it grew, heavy upon him,) even when he polled it, he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels according to the royal shekel. 2 Samuel 14:27 And there were born to Abessalom three sons and one daughter, and her name was Themar: she was a very beautiful woman, and she becomes the wife of Roboam son of Solomon, and she bears to him Abia. 2 Samuel 14:28 ¶ And Abessalom remained in Jerusalem two full years, and he saw not the king's face. 2 Samuel 14:29 And Abessalom sent to Joab to bring him in to the king, and he would not come to him: and he sent to him the second time, and he would not come. 2 Samuel 14:30 And Abessalom said to his servants, Behold, Joab's portion in the field is next to mine, and he has in it barley; go and set it on fire. And the servants of Abessalom set the field on fire: and the servants of Joab come to him with their clothes rent, and they said to him, The servants of Abessalom have set the field on fire. 2 Samuel 14:31 And Joab arose, and came to Abessalom into the house, and said to him, Why have thy servants set my field on fire? 2 Samuel 14:32 And Abessalom said to Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come hither, and I will send thee to the king, saying, Why did I come out of Gedsur? it would have been better for me to have remained there: and now, behold, I have not seen the face of the king; but if there is iniquity in me, then put me to death. 2 Samuel 14:33 And Joab went in to the king, and brought him word: and he called Abessalom, and he went in to the king, and did him obeisance, and fell upon his face to the ground, even in the presence of the king; and the king kissed Abessalom. 2 Samuel 15:1 ¶ And it came to pass after this that Abessalom prepared for himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 2 Samuel 15:2 And Abessalom rose early, and stood by the side of the way of the gate: and it came to pass that every man who had a cause, came to the king for judgment, and Abessalom cried to him, and said to him, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel. 2 Samuel 15:3 And Abessalom said to him, See, thy affairs are right and clear, yet thou hast no one appointed of the king to hear thee. 2 Samuel 15:4 And Abessalom said, O that one would make me a judge in the land; then every man who had a dispute or a cause would come to me, and I would judge him! 2 Samuel 15:5 And it came to pass when a man came near to do him obeisance, that he stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him. 2 Samuel 15:6 And Abessalom did after this manner to all Israel that came to the king for judgement; and Abessalom gained the hearts of the men of Israel. 2 Samuel 15:7 ¶ And it came to pass after forty years, that Abessalom said to his father, I will go now, and pay my vows, which I vowed to the Lord in Chebron. 2 Samuel 15:8 For thy servant vowed a vow when I dwelt at Gedsur in Syria, saying, If the Lord should indeed restore me to Jerusalem, then will I serve the Lord. 2 Samuel 15:9 And the king said to him, Go in peace. And he arose and went to Chebron. 2 Samuel 15:10 And Abessalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, When ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then shall ye say, Abessalom is become king in Chebron. 2 Samuel 15:11 And there went with Abessalom two hundred chosen men from Jerusalem; and they went in their simplicity, and knew not anything. 2 Samuel 15:12 And Abessalom sent to Achitophel the Theconite, the counsellor of David, from his city, from Gola, where he was sacrificing: and there was a strong conspiracy; and the people with Abessalom were increasingly numerous. 2 Samuel 15:13 ¶ And there came a messenger to David, saying, the heart of the men of Israel is gone after Abessalom. 2 Samuel 15:14 And David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, Rise, and let us flee, for we have no refuge from Abessalom: make haste and go, lest he overtake us speedily, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. 2 Samuel 15:15 And the king's servants said to the king, In all things which our lord the king chooses, behold we are thy servants. 2 Samuel 15:16 And the king and all his house went out on foot: and the king left ten women of his concubines to keep the house. 2 Samuel 15:17 And the king and all his servants went out on foot; and abode in a distant house. 2 Samuel 15:18 And all his servants passed on by his side, and every Chelethite, and every Phelethite, and they stood by the olive tree in the wilderness: and all the people marched near him, and all his court, and all the men of might, and all the men of war, six hundred: and they were present at his side: and every Chelethite, and every Phelethite, and all the six hundred Gittites that came on foot out of Geth, and they went on before the king. 2 Samuel 15:19 And the king said to Ethi, the Gittite, Why dost thou also go with us? return, and dwell with the king, for thou art a stranger, and thou has come forth as a sojourner out of thy place. 2 Samuel 15:20 Whereas thou camest yesterday, shall I to-day cause thee to travel with us, and shalt thou thus change thy place? thou didst come forth yesterday, and to-day shall I set thee in motion to go along with us? I indeed will go whithersoever I may go: return then, and cause thy brethren to return with thee, and may the Lord deal mercifully and truly with thee. 2 Samuel 15:21 And Ethi answered the king and said, As the Lord lives and as my lord the king lives, in the place wheresoever my lord shall be, whether it be for death or life, there shall thy servant be. 2 Samuel 15:22 And the king said to Ethi, Come and pass over with me. So Ethi the Gittite and the king passed over, and all his servants, and all the multitude with him. 2 Samuel 15:23 And all the country wept with a loud voice. And all the people passed by over the brook of Kedron; and the king crossed the brook Kedron: and all the people and the king passed on toward the way of the wilderness. 2 Samuel 15:24 ¶ And behold also Sadoc, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Baethar: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had passed out of the city. 2 Samuel 15:25 And the king said to Sadoc, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I should find favour in the eyes of the Lord, then will he bring me back, and he will shew me it and its beauty. 2 Samuel 15:26 But if he should say thus, I have no pleasure in thee; behold, here I am, let him do to me according to that which is good in his eyes. 2 Samuel 15:27 And the king said to Sadoc the priest, Behold, thou shalt return to the city in peace, and Achimaas thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons with you. 2 Samuel 15:28 Behold, I continue in arms in Araboth of the desert, until there come tidings from you to report to me. 2 Samuel 15:29 So Sadoc and Abiathar brought back the ark of the Lord to Jerusalem, and it continued there. 2 Samuel 15:30 And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, ascending and weeping, and had his head covered, and went barefooted: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head; and they went up, ascending and weeping. 2 Samuel 15:31 ¶ And it was reported to David, saying, Achitophel also is among the conspirators with Abessalom. And David said, O Lord my God, disconcert, I pray thee, the counsel of Achitophel. 2 Samuel 15:32 And David came as far as Ros, where he worshipped God: and behold, Chusi the chief friend of David came out to meet him, having rent his garment, and earth was upon his head. 2 Samuel 15:33 And David said to him, If thou shouldest go over with me, then wilt thou be a burden to me; 2 Samuel 15:34 but if thou shall return to the city, and shalt say to Abessalom, Thy brethren are passed over, and the king thy father is passed over after me: and now I am thy servant, O king, suffer me to live: at one time even of late I was the servant of thy father, and now I am thy humble servant-so shalt thou disconcert for me, the counsel of Achitophel. 2 Samuel 15:35 And, behold, there are there with thee Sadoc and Abiathar the priests; and it shall be that every word that thou shalt hear of the house of the king, thou shalt report it to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests. 2 Samuel 15:36 Behold, there are there with them their two sons, Achimaas the son of Sadoc, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar; and by them ye shall report to me every word which ye shall hear. 2 Samuel 15:37 So Chusi the friend of David went into the city, and Abessalom was lately gone into Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 16:1 ¶ And David passed on a little way from Ros; and, behold, Siba the servant of Memphibosthe came to meet him; and he had a couple of asses laden, and upon them two hundred loaves, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred cakes of dates, and bottle of wine. 2 Samuel 16:2 And the king said to Siba, What meanest thou by these? and Siba, said, The asses are for the household of the king to sit upon, and the loaves and the dates are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for them that are faint in the wilderness to drink. 2 Samuel 16:3 And the king said, And where is the son of thy master? and Siba said to the king, Behold, he remains in Jerusalem; for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father. 2 Samuel 16:4 And the king said to Siba, Behold, all Memphibosthe's property is thine. And Siba did obeisance and said, My lord, O king, let me find grace in thine eyes. 2 Samuel 16:5 ¶ And king David came to Baurim; and, behold, there came out from thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, and his name was Semei the son of Gera. He came forth and cursed as he went, 2 Samuel 16:6 and cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on the right and left hand of the king. 2 Samuel 16:7 And thus Semei said when he cursed him, Go out, go out, thou bloody man, and man of sin. 2 Samuel 16:8 The Lord has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, because thou hast reigned in his stead; and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of Abessalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man. 2 Samuel 16:9 And Abessa the son of Saruia said to the king, Why does this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over now and take off his head. 2 Samuel 16:10 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Saruia? even let him alone, and so let him curse, for the Lord has told him to curse David: and who shall say, Why hast thou done thus? 2 Samuel 16:11 And David said to Abessa and to all his servants, Behold, my son who came forth out of my bowels seeks my life; still more now may the son of Benjamin: let him curse, because the Lord has told him. 2 Samuel 16:12 If by any means the Lord may look on my affliction, thus shall he return me good for his cursing this day. 2 Samuel 16:13 And David and all the men with him went on the way: and Semei went by the side of the hill next to him, cursing as he went, and casting stones at him, and sprinkling him with dirt. 2 Samuel 16:14 And the king, and all the people with him, came away and refreshed themselves there. 2 Samuel 16:15 ¶ And Abessalom and all the men of Israel went into Jerusalem, and Achitophel with him. 2 Samuel 16:16 And it came to pass when Chusi the chief friend of David came to Abessalom, that Chusi said to Abessalom, Let the king live. 2 Samuel 16:17 And Abessalom said to Chusi, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not forth with thy friend? 2 Samuel 16:18 And Chusi said to Abessalom, Nay, but following whom the Lord, and this people, and all Israel have chosen,-his will I be, and with him I will dwell. 2 Samuel 16:19 And again, whom shall I serve? should I not in the presence of his son? As I served in the sight of thy father, so will I be in thy presence. 2 Samuel 16:20 And Abessalom said to Achitophel, Deliberate among yourselves concerning what we should do. 2 Samuel 16:21 And Achitophel said to Abessalom, Go in to thy father's concubines, whom he left to keep his house; and all Israel shall hear that thou hast dishonoured thy father; and the hands of all that are with thee shall be strengthened. 2 Samuel 16:22 And they pitched a tent for Abessalom on the roof, and Abessalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. 2 Samuel 16:23 And the counsel of Achitophel, which he counselled in former days, was as if one should enquire of the word of God: so was all the counsel of Achitophel both to David and also to Abessalom. 2 Samuel 17:1 ¶ And Achitophel said to Abessalom, Let me now choose out for myself twelve thousand men, and I will arise and follow after David this night: 2 Samuel 17:2 and I will come upon him when he is weary and weak-handed, and I will strike him with terror; and all the people with him shall flee, and I will smite the king only of all. 2 Samuel 17:3 And I will bring back all the people to thee, as a bride returns to her husband: only thou seekest the life of one man, and all the people shall have peace. 2 Samuel 17:4 And the saying was right in the eyes of Abessalom, and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel. 2 Samuel 17:5 And Abessalom said, Call now also Chusi the Arachite, and let us hear what is in his mouth, even in his also. 2 Samuel 17:6 And Chusi went in to Abessalom, and Abessalom spoke to him, saying, After this manner spoke Achitophel: shall we do according to his word? but if not, do thou speak. 2 Samuel 17:7 And Chusi said to Abessalom, This counsel which Achitophel has counselled this one time is not good. 2 Samuel 17:8 And Chusi said, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are very mighty, and bitter in their spirit, as a bereaved bear in the field, [[and as a wild boar in the plain]]: and thy father is a man of war, and will not give the people rest. 2 Samuel 17:9 For, behold, he is now hidden in one of the hills or in some other place: and it shall come to pass when he falls upon them at the beginning, that some one will certainly hear, and say, There has been a slaughter among the people that follow after Abessalom. 2 Samuel 17:10 Then even he that is strong, whose heart is as the heart of a lion,-it shall utterly melt: for all Israel knows that thy father is mighty, and they that are with him are mighty men. 2 Samuel 17:11 For thus I have surely given counsel, that all Israel be generally gathered to thee from Dan even to Bersabee, as the sand that is upon the sea-shore for multitude: and that thy presence go in the midst of them. 2 Samuel 17:12 And we will come upon him in one of the places where we shall find him, and we will encamp against him, as the dew falls upon the earth; and we will not leave of him and of his men so much as one. 2 Samuel 17:13 And if he shall have taken refuge with his army in a city, then shall all Israel take ropes to that city, and we will draw it even into the river, that there may not be left there even a stone. 2 Samuel 17:14 And Abessalom, and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Chusi the Arachite is better than the counsel of Achitophel. For the Lord ordained to disconcert the good counsel of Achitophel, that the Lord might bring all evil upon Abessalom. 2 Samuel 17:15 ¶ And Chusi the Arachite said to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus Achitophel counselled Abessalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled. 2 Samuel 17:16 And now send quickly and report to David, saying, Lodge not this night in Araboth of the wilderness: even go and make haste, lest one swallow up the king, and all the people with him. 2 Samuel 17:17 And Jonathan and Achimaas stood by the well of Rogel, and a maid-servant went and reported to them, and they go and tell king David; for they might not be seen to enter into the city. 2 Samuel 17:18 But a young man saw them and told Abessalom: and the two went quickly, and entered into the house of a man in Baurim; and he had a well in his court, and they went down into it. 2 Samuel 17:19 And a woman took a covering, and spread it over the mouth of the well, and spread out ground corn upon it to dry, and the thing was not known. 2 Samuel 17:20 And the servants of Abessalom came to the woman into the house, and said, Where are Achimaas and Jonathan? and the woman said to them, They are gone a little way beyond the water. And they sought and found them not, and returned to Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 17:21 And it came to pass after they were gone, that they came up out of the pit, and went on their way; and reported to king David, and said to David, Arise ye and go quickly over the water, for thus has Achitophel counselled concerning you. 2 Samuel 17:22 ¶ And David rose up and all the people with him, and they passed over Jordan till the morning light; there was not one missing who did not pass over Jordan. 2 Samuel 17:23 And Achitophel saw that his counsel was not followed, and he saddled his ass, and rose and departed to his house into his city; and he gave orders to his household, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. 2 Samuel 17:24 And David passed over to Manaim: and Abessalom crossed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 2 Samuel 17:25 And Abessalom appointed Amessai in the room of Joab over the host. And Amessai was the son of a man whose name was Jether of Jezrael: he went in to Abigaia the daughter of Naas, the sister of Saruia the mother of Joab. 2 Samuel 17:26 And all Israel and Abessalom encamped in the land of Galaad. 2 Samuel 17:27 And it came to pass when David came to Manaim, that Uesbi the son of Naas of Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and Machir son of Amiel of Lodabar, and Berzelli the Galaadite of Rogellim, 2 Samuel 17:28 brought ten embroidered beds, (with double coverings,) and ten caldrons, and earthenware, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and meal, and beans, and pulse, 2 Samuel 17:29 and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheeses of kine: and they brought them to David and to his people with him to eat; for one said, The people is faint and hungry and thirsty in the wilderness. 2 Samuel 18:1 ¶ And David numbered the people with him, and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds. 2 Samuel 18:2 And David sent away the people, the third part under the hand of Joab, and the third part under the hand of Abessa the son of Saruia, the brother of Joab, and the third part under the hand of Ethi the Gittite. And David said to the people, I also will surely go out with you. 2 Samuel 18:3 And they said, Thou shalt not go out: for if we should indeed flee, they will not care for us; and if half of us should die, they will not mind us; for thou art as ten thousand of us: and now it is well that thou shalt be to us an aid to help us in the city. 2 Samuel 18:4 And the king said to them, Whatsoever shall seem good in your eyes I will do. And the king stood by the side of the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. 2 Samuel 18:5 And the king commanded Joab and Abessa and Ethi, saying, Spare for my sake the young man Abessalom. And all the people heard the king charging all the commanders concerning Abessalom. 2 Samuel 18:6 And all the people went out into the wood against Israel; and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim. 2 Samuel 18:7 And the people of Israel fell down there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter in that day, even twenty thousand men. 2 Samuel 18:8 And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the land: and the wood consumed more of the people than the sword consumed among the people in that day. 2 Samuel 18:9 ¶ And Abessalom went to meet the servants of David: and Abessalom was mounted on his mule, and the mule came under the thick boughs of a great oak; and his head was entangled in the oak, and he was suspended between heaven and earth; and the mule passed on from under him. 2 Samuel 18:10 And a man saw it, and reported to Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Abessalom hanging in an oak. 2 Samuel 18:11 And Joab said to the man who reported it to him, And, behold, thou didst see him: why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten pieces of silver, and a girdle. 2 Samuel 18:12 And the man said to Joab, Were I even to receive a thousand shekels of silver, I would not lift my hand against the king's son; for in our ears the king charged thee and Abessa and Ethi, saying, Take care of the young man Abessalom for me, 2 Samuel 18:13 so as to do no harm to his life: and nothing of the matter will be concealed from the king, and thou wilt set thyself against me. 2 Samuel 18:14 And Joab said, I will begin this; I will not thus remain with thee. And Joab took three darts in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Abessalom, while he was yet alive in the heart of the oak. 2 Samuel 18:15 And ten young men that bore Joab's armour compassed Abessalom, and smote him and slew him. 2 Samuel 18:16 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab spared the people. 2 Samuel 18:17 And he took Abessalom, and cast him into a great cavern in the wood, into a deep pit, and set up over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every man to his tent. 2 Samuel 18:18 Now Abessalom while yet alive had taken and set up for himself the pillar near which he was taken, and set it up so as to have the pillar in the king's dale; for he said he had no son to keep his name in remembrance: and he called the pillar, Abessalom's hand, until this day. 2 Samuel 18:19 ¶ And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said, Let me run now and carry glad tidings to the king, for the Lord has delivered him from the hand of his enemies. 2 Samuel 18:20 And Joab said to him, Thou shalt not be a messenger of glad tidings this day; thou shalt bear them another day; but on this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead. 2 Samuel 18:21 And Joab said to Chusi, Go, report to the king all that thou hast seen. And Chusi did obeisance to Joab, and went out. 2 Samuel 18:22 And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said again to Joab, Nay, let me also run after Chusi. And Joab said, Why wouldest thou thus run, my son? attend, thou hast no tidings for profit if thou go. 2 Samuel 18:23 And he said, Why should I not run? and Joab said to him, Run. And Achimaas ran along the way of Kechar, and outran Chusi. 2 Samuel 18:24 And David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up on the top of the gate of the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone before him. 2 Samuel 18:25 And the watchman cried out, and reported to the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there are good tidings in his mouth. And the man came and drew near. 2 Samuel 18:26 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman cried at the gate, and said, And look, another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings glad tidings. 2 Samuel 18:27 And the watchman said, I see the running of the first as the running of Achimaas the son of Sadoc. And the king said, He is a good man, and will come to report glad tidings. 2 Samuel 18:28 And Achimaas cried out and said to the king, Peace. And he did obeisance to the king with his face to the ground, and said, Blessed be the Lord thy God, who has delivered up the men that lifted up their hands against my lord the king. 2 Samuel 18:29 And the king said, Is the young man Abessalom safe? and Achimaas said, I saw a great multitude at the time of Joab's sending the king's servant and thy servant, and I knew not what was there. 2 Samuel 18:30 And the king said, Turn aside, stand still here. And he turned aside, and stood. 2 Samuel 18:31 And, behold, Chusi came up, and said to the king, Let my lord the king hear glad tidings, for the Lord has avenged thee this day upon all them that rose up against thee. 2 Samuel 18:32 And the king said to Chusi, Is it well with the young man Abessalom? and Chusi said, Let the enemies of my lord the king, and all whosoever have risen up against him for evil, be as that young man. 2 Samuel 18:33 And the king was troubled, and went to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and thus he said as he went, My son Abessalom, my son, my son Abessalom; would God I had died for thee, even I had died for thee, Abessalom, my son, my son! 2 Samuel 19:1 ¶ And they brought Joab word, saying, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Abessalom. 2 Samuel 19:2 And the victory was turned that day into mourning to all the people, for the people heard say that day, The king grieves after his son. 2 Samuel 19:3 And the people stole away that day to go into the city, as people steal away when they are ashamed as they flee in the battle. 2 Samuel 19:4 And the king hid his face: and the king cried with a loud voice, My son Abessalom! Abessalom my son! 2 Samuel 19:5 And Joab went in to the king, into the house, and said, Thou hast this day shamed the faces of all thy servants that have delivered thee this day, and have saved the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and of thy concubines, 2 Samuel 19:6 forasmuch as thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee; and thou hast this day declared, that thy princes and thy servants are nothing in thy sight: for I know this day, that if Abessalom were alive, and all of us dead to-day, then it would have been right in thy sight. 2 Samuel 19:7 And now arise, and go forth, and speak comfortably to thy servants; for I have sworn by the Lord, that unless thou wilt go forth to-day, there shall not a man remain with thee this night: and know for thyself, this thing will indeed be evil to thee beyond all the evil that has come upon thee from thy youth until now. 2 Samuel 19:8 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate: and all the people reported, saying, Behold, the king sits in the gate. And all the people went in before the king to the gate; for Israel had fled every man to his tent. 2 Samuel 19:9 ¶ And all the people disputed among all the tribes of Israel, saying, King David delivered us from all our enemies, and he rescued us from the hand of the Philistines: and now he has fled from the land, and from his kingdom, and from Abessalom. 2 Samuel 19:10 And Abessalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle: and now why are ye silent about bringing back the king? And the word of all Israel came to the king. 2 Samuel 19:11 And king David sent to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Israel, saying, Why are ye the last to bring back the king to his house? whereas the word of all Israel is come to the king to his house. 2 Samuel 19:12 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: why are ye the last to bring back the king to his house? 2 Samuel 19:13 And ye shall say to Amessai, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? and now God do so to me, and more also, if thou shalt not be commander of the host before me continually in the room of Joab. 2 Samuel 19:14 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Juda as that of one man; and they sent to the king, saying, Return thou, and all thy servants. 2 Samuel 19:15 And the king returned, and came as far s Jordan. And the men of Juda came to Galgala on their way to meet the king, to cause the king to pass over Jordan. 2 Samuel 19:16 ¶ And Semei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Baurim, hasted and went down with the men of Juda to meet king David. 2 Samuel 19:17 And a thousand men of Benjamin were with him, and Siba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons with him, and his twenty servants with him: and they went directly down to Jordan before the king, 2 Samuel 19:18 and they performed the service of bringing the king over; and there went over a ferry-boat to remove the household of the king, and to do that which was right in his eyes. And Semei the son of Gera fell on his face before the king, as he went over Jordan; 2 Samuel 19:19 and said to the king, Let not my lord now impute iniquity, and remember not all the iniquity of thy servant in the day in which my lord went out from Jerusalem, so that the king should mind it. 2 Samuel 19:20 For thy servant knows that I have sinned: and, behold, I am come to-day before all Israel and the house of Joseph, to go down and meet my lord the king. 2 Samuel 19:21 And Abessai the son of Saruia answered and said, Shall not Semei therefore be put to death, because he cursed the Lord's anointed? 2 Samuel 19:22 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Saruia, that ye as it were lie in wait against me this day? to-day no man in Israel shall be put to death, for I know not if I this day reign over Israel. 2 Samuel 19:23 And the king said to Semei, Thou shalt not die: and the king swore to him. 2 Samuel 19:24 ¶ And Memphibosthe the son of Saul's son went down to meet the king, and had not dressed his feet, nor pared his nails, nor shaved himself, neither had he washed his garments, from the day that the king departed, until the day when he arrived in peace. 2 Samuel 19:25 And it came to pass when he went into Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why didst thou not go with me, Memphibosthe? 2 Samuel 19:26 And Memphibosthe said to him, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for thy servant said to him, Saddle me the ass, and I will ride upon it, and go with the king; for thy servant is lame. 2 Samuel 19:27 And he has dealt deceitfully with thy servant to my lord the king: but my lord the king is as an angel of God, and do thou that which is good in thine eyes. 2 Samuel 19:28 For all the house of my father were but as dead men before my lord the king; yet thou hast set thy servant among them that eat at thy table: and what right have I any longer even to cry to the king? 2 Samuel 19:29 And the king said to him, Why speakest thou any longer of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Siba shall divide the land. 2 Samuel 19:30 And Memphibosthe said to the king, Yea, let him take all, since my lord the king has come in peace to his house. 2 Samuel 19:31 ¶ And Berzelli the Galaadite came down from Rogellim, and crossed over Jordan with the king, that he might conduct the king over Jordan. 2 Samuel 19:32 And Berzelli was a very old man, eighty years old; and he had maintained the king when he dwelt in Manaim; for he was a very great man. 2 Samuel 19:33 And the king said to Berzelli, Thou shalt go over with me, and I will nourish thine old age with me in Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 19:34 And Berzelli said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? 2 Samuel 19:35 I am this day eighty years old: can I then distinguish between good and evil? Can thy servant taste any longer what I eat or drink? can I any longer hear the voice of singing men or singing women? and wherefore shall thy servant any longer be a burden to my lord the king? 2 Samuel 19:36 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why does the king return me this recompense? 2 Samuel 19:37 Let, I pray thee, thy servant remain, and I will die in my city, by the tomb of my father and of my mother. And, behold, thy servant Chamaam shall go over with my lord the king; and do thou to him as it seems good in thine eyes. 2 Samuel 19:38 And the king said, Let Chamaam go over with me, and I will do to him what is good in my sight; and whatsoever thou shalt choose at my hand, I will do for thee. 2 Samuel 19:39 And all the people went over Jordan, and the king went over; and the king kissed Berzelli, and blessed him; and he returned to his place. 2 Samuel 19:40 ¶ And the king went over to Galgala, and Chamaam went over with him: and all the men of Juda went over with the king, and also half the people of Israel. 2 Samuel 19:41 And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brethren the men of Juda stolen thee away, and caused the king and all his house to pass over Jordan, and all the men of David with him? 2 Samuel 19:42 And all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel, and said, Because the king is near of kin to us: and why were you thus angry concerning this matter? have we indeed eaten of the king's food? or has he given us a gift, or has he sent us a portion? 2 Samuel 19:43 And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we are older than you, we have also an interest in David above you: and why have ye thus insulted us, and why was not our advice taken before that of Juda, to bring back our king? And the speech of the men of Juda was sharper than the speech of the men of Israel. 2 Samuel 20:1 ¶ And there was a transgressor so called there, and his name was Sabee, a Benjamite, the son of Bochori: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jessae: to thy tents, O Israel, every one. 2 Samuel 20:2 And all the men of Israel went up from following David after Sabee the son of Bochori: but the men of Juda adhered to their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 20:3 And David went into his house at Jerusalem: and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and he put them in a place of custody, and maintained them, and went not in to them; and they were kept living as widows, till the day of their death. 2 Samuel 20:4 ¶ And the king said to Amessai, Call to me the men of Juda for three days, and do thou be present here. 2 Samuel 20:5 And Amessai went to call Juda, and delayed beyond the time which David appointed him. 2 Samuel 20:6 And David said to Amessai, Now shall Sabee the son of Bochori do us more harm than Abessalom: now then take thou with thee the servants of thy lord, and follow after him, lest he find for himself strong cities, so will he blind our eyes. 2 Samuel 20:7 And there went out after him Amessai and the men of Joab, and the Cherethites, and the Phelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sabee the son of Bochori. 2 Samuel 20:8 And they were by the great stone that is in Gabaon: and Amessai went in before them: and Joab had upon him a military cloak over his apparel, and over it he was girded with a dagger fastened upon his loins in its scabbard: and the dagger came out, it even came out and fell. 2 Samuel 20:9 And Joab said to Amessai, Art thou in health, my brother? and the right hand of Joab took hold of the beard of Amessai to kiss him. 2 Samuel 20:10 And Amessai observed not the dagger that was in the hand of Joab: and Joab smote him with it on the loins, and his bowels were shed out upon the ground, and he did not repeat the blow, and he died: and Joab and Abessai his brother pursued after Sabee the son of Bochori. 2 Samuel 20:11 And there stood over him one of the servants of Joab, and said, Who is he that is for Joab, and who is on the side of David following Joab? 2 Samuel 20:12 And Amessai was weltering in blood in the midst of the way. And a man saw that all the people stood still; and he removed Amessai out of the path into a field, and he cast a garment upon him, because he saw every one that came to him standing still. 2 Samuel 20:13 And when he was quickly removed from the road, every man of Israel passed after Joab to pursue after Sabee the son of Bochori. 2 Samuel 20:14 ¶ And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Bethmacha; and all in Charri too were assembled, and followed after him. 2 Samuel 20:15 And they came and besieged him in Abel and Phermacha: and they raised a mound against the city and it stood close to the wall; and all the people with Joab proposed to throw down the wall. 2 Samuel 20:16 And a wise woman cried from the wall, and said, Hear, hear; say, I pray ye, to Joab, Draw near hither, and I will speak to him. 2 Samuel 20:17 And he drew nigh to her, and the woman said to him, Art thou Joab? and he said, I am. And she said to him, Hear the words of thy handmaid; and Joab said, I do hear. 2 Samuel 20:18 And she spoke, saying, Of old time they said thus, Surely one was asked in Abel, and Dan, whether the faithful in Israel failed in what they purposed; they will surely ask in Abel, even in like manner, whether they have failed. 2 Samuel 20:19 I am a peaceable one of the strong ones in Israel; but thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother city in Israel: why dost thou seek to ruin the inheritance of the Lord? 2 Samuel 20:20 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should ruin or destroy. 2 Samuel 20:21 Is not the case thus, that a man of mount Ephraim, Sabee, son of Bochori by name, has even lifted up his hand against king David? Give him only to me, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall. 2 Samuel 20:22 And the woman went in to all the people, and she spoke to all the city in her wisdom; and they took off the head of Sabee the son of Bochori; and took it away and threw it to Joab: and he blew the trumpet, and the people separated from the city away from him, every man to his tent: and Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king. 2 Samuel 20:23 ¶ And Joab was over all the forces of Israel: and Banaias the son of Jodae was over the Cherethites and over the Phelethites. 2 Samuel 20:24 And Adoniram was over the tribute: and Josaphath the son of Achiluth was recorder. 2 Samuel 20:25 And Susa was scribe: and Sadoc and Abiathar were priests. 2 Samuel 20:26 Moreover Iras the son of Iarin was priest to David. 2 Samuel 21:1 ¶ And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of the Lord. And the Lord said, There is guilt upon Saul and his house because of his bloody murder, whereby he slew the Gabaonites. 2 Samuel 21:2 And King David called the Gabaonites, and said to them;-(now the Gabaonites are not the children of Israel, but are of the remnant of the Amorite, and the children of Israel had sworn to them: but Saul sought to smite them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Juda.) 2 Samuel 21:3 And David said to the Gabaonites, What shall I do to you? and wherewithal shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the Lord? 2 Samuel 21:4 And the Gabaonites said to him, We have no question about silver or gold with Saul and with his house; and there is no man for us to put to death in Israel. 2 Samuel 21:5 And he said, What say ye? speak, and I will do it for you. And they said to the king, The man who would have made an end of us, and persecuted us, who plotted against us to destroy us, let us utterly destroy him, so that he shall have no standing in all the coasts of Israel. 2 Samuel 21:6 Let one give us seven men of his sons, and let us hang them up in the sun to the Lord in Gabaon of Saul, as chosen out for the Lord. And the king said, I will give them. 2 Samuel 21:7 But the king spared Memphibosthe son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the Lord that was between them, even between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. 2 Samuel 21:8 And the king took the two sons of Respha the daughter of Aia, whom she bore to Saul, Hermonoi and Memphibosthe, and the five sons of Michol daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Esdriel son of Berzelli the Moulathite. 2 Samuel 21:9 And he gave them into the hand of the Gabaonites, and they hanged them up to the sun in the mountain before the lord: and they fell, even the seven together: moreover they were put to death in the days of harvest at the commencement, in the beginning of barley-harvest. 2 Samuel 21:10 ¶ And Respha the daughter of Aia took sackcloth, and fixed it for herself on the rock in the beginning of barley harvest, until water dropped upon them out of heaven: and she did not suffer the birds of the air to rest upon them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. 2 Samuel 21:11 And it was told David what Respha the daughter of Aia the concubine of Saul had done, [[and they were faint, and Dan, the son of Joa of the offspring of the giants overtook them.]] 2 Samuel 21:12 And David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of the sons of Jabis Galaad, who stole them from the street of Baethsan; for the Philistines set them there in the day in which the Philistines smote Saul in Gelbue. 2 Samuel 21:13 And he carried up thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and gathered the bones of them that had been hanged. 2 Samuel 21:14 And they buried the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and the bones of them that had been hanged, in the land of Benjamin in the hill, in the sepulchre of Cis his father; and they did all things that the king commanded: and after this God hearkened to the prayers of the land. 2 Samuel 21:15 ¶ And there was yet war between the Philistines and Israel: and David went down and his servants with him, and they fought with the Philistines, and David went. 2 Samuel 21:16 And Jesbi, who was of the progeny of Rapha, and the head of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, who also was girt with a club, even he thought to smite David. 2 Samuel 21:17 And Abessa the son of Saruia helped him and smote the Philistine, and slew him. Then the men of David swore, saying, Thou shalt not any longer go out with us to battle, and thou shalt not quench the lamp of Israel. 2 Samuel 21:18 And after this there was a battle again with the Philistines in Geth: then Sebocha the Astatothite slew Seph of the progeny of Rapha. 2 Samuel 21:19 And there was a battle in Rom with the Philistines; and Eleanan son of Ariorgim the Bethleemite slew Goliath the Gittite; and the staff of his spear was as a weaver's beam. 2 Samuel 21:20 And there was yet a battle in Geth: and there was a man of stature, and the fingers of his hands and the toes of his feet were six on each, four and twenty in number: and he also was born to Rapha. 2 Samuel 21:21 And he defied Israel, and Jonathan son of Semei brother of David, smote him. 2 Samuel 21:22 These four were born descendants of the giants in Geth, the family of Rapha; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. 2 Samuel 22:1 ¶ And David spoke to the Lord the words of this song, in the day in which the Lord rescued him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul. 2 Samuel 22:2 ¶ And the song was thus: O Lord, my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, 2 Samuel 22:3 my God; he shall be to me my guard, I will trust in him: he is my protector, and the horn of my salvation, my helper, and my sure refuge; thou shalt save me from the unjust man. 2 Samuel 22:4 I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised, and I shall be saved from my enemies. 2 Samuel 22:5 For the troubles of death compassed me, the floods of iniquity amazed me: 2 Samuel 22:6 the pangs of death surrounded me, the agonies of death prevented me. 2 Samuel 22:7 When I am afflicted I will call upon the Lord, and will cry to my God, and he shall hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry shalt come into his ears. 2 Samuel 22:8 And the earth was troubled and quaked, and the foundations of heaven were confounded and torn asunder, because the Lord was wroth with them. 2 Samuel 22:9 There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire out of his mouth devours: coals were kindled at it. 2 Samuel 22:10 And he bowed the heavens, and came down, and there was darkness under his feet. 2 Samuel 22:11 And he rode upon the cherubs and did fly, and was seen upon the wings of the wind. 2 Samuel 22:12 And he made darkness his hiding-place; his tabernacle round about him was the darkness of waters, he condensed it with the clouds of the air. 2 Samuel 22:13 At the brightness before him coals of fire were kindled. 2 Samuel 22:14 The Lord thundered out of heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice. 2 Samuel 22:15 And he sent forth arrows, and scattered them, and he flashed lightning, and dismayed them. 2 Samuel 22:16 And the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuke of the Lord, at the blast of the breath of his anger. 2 Samuel 22:17 He sent from above and took me; he drew me out of many waters. 2 Samuel 22:18 He delivered me from my strong enemies, from them that hated me, for they were stronger than I. 2 Samuel 22:19 The days of my affliction prevented me; but the Lord was my stay. 2 Samuel 22:20 And he brought me into a wide place, and rescued me, because he delighted in me. 2 Samuel 22:21 And the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands did he recompense me. 2 Samuel 22:22 Because, I kept the ways of the Lord, and did not wickedly depart from my God. 2 Samuel 22:23 For all his judgments and his ordinances were before me: I departed not from them. 2 Samuel 22:24 And I shall be blameless before him, and will keep myself from my iniquity. 2 Samuel 22:25 And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands in his eye-sight. 2 Samuel 22:26 With the holy thou wilt be holy, and with the perfect man thou will be perfect, 2 Samuel 22:27 and with the excellent thou wilt be excellent, and with the froward thou will be froward. 2 Samuel 22:28 And thou wilt save the poor people, and wilt bring down the eyes of the haughty. 2 Samuel 22:29 For thou, Lord, art my lamp, and the Lord shall shine forth to me in my darkness. 2 Samuel 22:30 For by thee shall I run as a girded man, and by my God shall I leap over a wall. 2 Samuel 22:31 As for the Mighty One, his way is blameless: the word of the Lord is strong and tried in the fire: he is a protector to all that put their trust in him. 2 Samuel 22:32 Who is strong, but the Lord? and who will be a Creator except our God? 2 Samuel 22:33 It is the Mighty One who strengthens me with might, and has prepared my way without fault. 2 Samuel 22:34 He makes my feet like hart's feet, and sets me upon the high places. 2 Samuel 22:35 He teaches my hands to war, and has broken a brazen bow by my arm. 2 Samuel 22:36 And thou hast given me the shield of my salvation, and thy propitious dealing has increased me, 2 Samuel 22:37 so as to make room under me for my going, and my legs did not totter. 2 Samuel 22:38 I will pursue my enemies, and will utterly destroy them; and I will not turn again till I have consumed them. 2 Samuel 22:39 And I will crush them, and they shall not rise; and they shall fall under my feet. 2 Samuel 22:40 And thou shalt strengthen me with power for the war; thou shalt cause them that rise up against me to bow down under me. 2 Samuel 22:41 And thou hast caused mine enemies to flee before me, even them that hated me, and thou hast slain them. 2 Samuel 22:42 They shall cry, and there shall be no helper; to the Lord, but he hearkens not to them. 2 Samuel 22:43 And I ground them as the dust of the earth, I beat them small as the mire of the streets. 2 Samuel 22:44 And thou shalt deliver me from the striving of the peoples, thou shalt keep me to be the head of the Gentiles: a people which I knew not served me. 2 Samuel 22:45 The strange children feigned obedience to me; they hearkened to me as soon as they heard. 2 Samuel 22:46 The strange children shall be cast away, and shall be overthrown out of their hiding places. 2 Samuel 22:47 The Lord lives, and blessed be my guardian, and my God, my strong keeper, shall be exalted. 2 Samuel 22:48 The Lord who avenges me is strong, chastening the nations under me, 2 Samuel 22:49 and bringing me out from my enemies: and thou shalt set me on high from among those that rise up against me: thou shalt deliver me from the violent man. 2 Samuel 22:50 Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and sing to thy name. 2 Samuel 22:51 He magnifies the salvation of his king, and works mercy for his anointed, even for David and for his seed for ever. 2 Samuel 23:1 ¶ And these are the last words of David. Faithful is David the son of Jessae, and faithful the man whom the Lord raised up to be the anointed of the God of Jacob, and beautiful are the psalms of Israel. 2 Samuel 23:2 The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, and his word was upon my tongue. 2 Samuel 23:3 The God of Israel says, A watchman out of Israel spoke to me a parable: I said among men, How will ye strengthen the fear of the anointed? 2 Samuel 23:4 And in the morning light of God, let the sun arise in the morning, from the light of which the Lord passed on, and as it were from the rain of the tender grass upon the earth. 2 Samuel 23:5 For my house is not so with the Mighty One: for he has made an everlasting covenant with me, ready, guarded at every time; for all my salvation and all my desire is, that the wicked should not flourish. 2 Samuel 23:6 All these are as a thorn thrust forth, for they shall not be taken with the hand, 2 Samuel 23:7 and a man shall not labour among them; and one shall have that which is fully armed with iron, and the staff of a spear, an he shall burn them with fire, and they shall be burnt in their shame. 2 Samuel 23:8 ¶ These are the names of the mighty men of David: Jebosthe the Chananite is a captain of the third part: Adinon the Asonite, he drew his sword against eight hundred soldiers at once. 2 Samuel 23:9 And after him Eleanan the son of his uncle, son of Dudi who was among the three mighty men with David; and when he defied the Philistines they were gathered there to war, and the men of Israel went up. 2 Samuel 23:10 He arose an smote the Philistines, until his hand was weary, and his hand clave to the sword: and the Lord wrought a great salvation in that day, and the people rested behind him only to strip the slain. 2 Samuel 23:11 And after him Samaia the son of Asa the Arachite: and the Philistines were gathered to Theria; and there was there a portion of ground full of lentiles; and the people fled before the Philistines. 2 Samuel 23:12 And he stood firm in the midst of the portion, and rescued it, and smote the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great deliverance. 2 Samuel 23:13 And three out of the thirty went down, and came to Cason to David, to the cave of Odollam; and there was an army of the Philistines, and they encamped in the valley of Raphain. 2 Samuel 23:14 And David was then in the strong hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethleem. 2 Samuel 23:15 And David longed, and said, Who will give me water to drink out of the well that is in Bethleem by the gate? now the band of the Philistines was then in Bethleem. 2 Samuel 23:16 And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well that was in Bethleem in the gate: and they took it, and brought it to David, and he would not drink it, but poured it out before the Lord. 2 Samuel 23:17 And he said, O Lord, forbid that I should do this, that I should drink of the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives: and he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men. 2 Samuel 23:18 And Abessa the brother of Joab the son of Saruia, he was chief among the three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew; and he had a name among three. 2 Samuel 23:19 Of those three he was most honourable, and he became a chief over them, but he reached not to the first three. 2 Samuel 23:20 And Banaeas the son of Jodae, he was abundant in mighty deeds, from Cabeseel, and he smote the two sons of Ariel of Moab: and he went down and smote a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day. 2 Samuel 23:21 He smote an Egyptian, a wonderful man, and in the hand of the Egyptian was a spear as the side of a ladder; and he went down to him with a staff, and snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 2 Samuel 23:22 These things did Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he had a name among the three mighty men. 2 Samuel 23:23 He was honourable among the second three, but he reached not to the first three: and David made him his reporter. And these are the names of King David's mighty men. 2 Samuel 23:24 Asael Joab's brother; he was among the thirty. Eleanan son of Dudi his uncle in Bethleem. 2 Samuel 23:25 Saema the Rudaean. 2 Samuel 23:26 Selles the Kelothite: Iras the son of Isca the Thecoite. 2 Samuel 23:27 Abiezer the Anothite, of the sons of the Anothite. 2 Samuel 23:28 Ellon the Aoite; Noere the Netophatite. 2 Samuel 23:29 Esthai the son of Riba of Gabaeth, son of Benjamin the Ephrathite; Asmoth the Bardiamite; Emasu the Salabonite: 2 Samuel 23:30 Adroi of the brooks. 2 Samuel 23:31 Gadabiel son of the Arabothaeite. 2 Samuel 23:32 the sons of Asan, Jonathan; 2 Samuel 23:33 Samnan the Arodite; Amnan the son of Arai the Saraurite. 2 Samuel 23:34 Aliphaleth the son of Asbites, the son of the Machachachite; Eliab the son of Achitophel the Gelonite. 2 Samuel 23:35 Asarai the Carmelite the son of Uraeoerchi. 2 Samuel 23:36 Gaal the son of Nathana. The son of much valour, the son of Galaaddi. Elie the Ammanite. 2 Samuel 23:37 Gelore the Bethorite, armour-bearer to Joab, son of Saruia. 2 Samuel 23:38 Iras the Ethirite. Gerab the Ethenite. 2 Samuel 23:39 Urias the Chettite: thirty-seven in all. 2 Samuel 24:1 ¶ And the Lord caused his anger to burn forth again in Israel, and Satan stirred up David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Juda. 2 Samuel 24:2 And the king said to Joab commander of the host, who was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel and Juda, from Dan even to Bersabee, and number the people, and I will know the number of the people. 2 Samuel 24:3 And Joab said to the king, Now may the Lord add to the people a hundred-fold as many as they are, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why does my lord the king desire this thing? 2 Samuel 24:4 Nevertheless the word of the king prevailed against Joab an the captains of the host: And Joab and the captains of the host went out before the king to number the people of Israel. 2 Samuel 24:5 And they went over Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right of the city which is in the midst of the valley of Gad and Eliezer. 2 Samuel 24:6 And they came to Galaad, and into the land of Thabason, which is Adasai, and they came to Danidan and Udan, and compassed Sidon. 2 Samuel 24:7 And they came to Mapsar of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Evite and the Chananite: and they came by the South of Juda to Bersabee. 2 Samuel 24:8 And they compassed the whole land; and they arrived at Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 2 Samuel 24:9 And Joab gave in the number of the census of the people to the king: and Israel consisted of eight hundred thousand men of might that drew sword; and the men of Juda, five hundred thousand fighting men. 2 Samuel 24:10 ¶ And the heart of David smote him after he had numbered the people; and David said to the Lord, I have sinned grievously, O Lord, in what I have now done: remove, I pray thee, the iniquity of thy servant, for I have been exceedingly foolish. 2 Samuel 24:11 And David rose early in the morning, and the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, the seer, saying, Go, and speak to David, saying, 2 Samuel 24:12 Thus saith the Lord, I bring one of three things upon thee: now choose thee one of them, and I will do it to thee. 2 Samuel 24:13 And Gad went in to David, and told him, and said to him, Choose one of these things to befall thee, whether there shall come upon thee for three years famine in thy land; or that thou shouldest flee three months before thine enemies, and they should pursue thee; or that there should be for three days mortality in thy land. Now then decide, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me. 2 Samuel 24:14 And David said to Gad, On every side I am much straitened: let me fall now into the hands of the Lord, for his compassions are very many; and let me not fall into the hands of man. 2 Samuel 24:15 So David chose for himself the mortality: and they were the days of wheat-harvest; and the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from morning till noon, and the plague began among the people; and there died of the people from Dan even to Bersabee seventy thousand men. 2 Samuel 24:16 And the angel of the Lord stretched out his hand against Jerusalem to destroy it, and the Lord repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough now, withhold thine hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite. 2 Samuel 24:17 And David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel smiting the people, and he said, Behold, it is I that have done wrong, but these sheep what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, be upon me, and upon my father's house. 2 Samuel 24:18 ¶ And Gad came to David in that day, and said to him, Go up, and set up to the Lord and altar in the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite. 2 Samuel 24:19 And David went up according to the word of Gad, as the Lord commanded him. 2 Samuel 24:20 And Orna looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on before him: and Orna went forth, and did obeisance to the king with his face to the earth. 2 Samuel 24:21 And Orna said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? and David said, To buy of thee the threshing-floor, in order to build an altar to the Lord that the plague may be restrained from off the people. 2 Samuel 24:22 And Orna said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer to the Lord that which is good in his eyes: behold, here are oxen for a whole-burnt-offering, and the wheels and furniture of the oxen for wood. 2 Samuel 24:23 Orna gave all to the king: and Orna said to the king, The Lord thy God bless thee. 2 Samuel 24:24 And the king said to Orna, Nay, but I will surely buy it of thee at a fair price, and I will not offer to the Lord my God a whole-burnt-offering for nothing. So David purchased the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. 2 Samuel 24:25 And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered up whole-burnt-offerings and peace- offerings: and Solomon made an addition to the altar afterwards, for it was little at first. And the Lord hearkened to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel. 1 Kings 1:1 ¶ And king David was old and advanced in days, and they covered him with clothes, and he was not warmed. 1 Kings 1:2 And his servants said, Let them seek for the king a young virgin, and she shall wait on the king, and cherish him, and lie with him, and my lord the king shall be warmed. 1 Kings 1:3 So they sought for a fair damsel out of all the coasts of Israel; and they found Abisag the Somanite, and they brought her to the king. 1 Kings 1:4 And the damsel was extremely beautiful, and she cherished the king, and ministered to him, but the king knew her not. 1 Kings 1:5 ¶ And Adonias the son of Aggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king; and he prepared for himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 1 Kings 1:6 And his father never at any time checked him, saying, Why hast thou done thus? and he was also very handsome in appearance, and his mother bore him after Abessalom. 1 Kings 1:7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Saruia, and with Abiathar the priest, and they followed after Adonias. 1 Kings 1:8 But Sadoc the priest, and Banaeas the son of Jodae, and Nathan the prophet, and Semei, and Resi, and the mighty men of David, did not follow Adonias. 1 Kings 1:9 And Adonias sacrificed sheep and calves and lambs by the stone of Zoelethi, which was near Rogel: and he called all his brethren, and all the adult men of Juda, servants of the king. 1 Kings 1:10 But Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he did not call. 1 Kings 1:11 ¶ And Nathan spoke to Bersabee the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonias the son of Aggith reigns, and our lord David knows it not? 1 Kings 1:12 And now come, let me, I pray, give thee counsel, and thou shalt rescue thy life, and the life of thy son Solomon. 1 Kings 1:13 Haste, and go in to king David, and thou shalt speak to him, saying, Hast not thou, my lord, O king, sworn to thine handmaid, saying, Thy son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then does Adonias reign? 1 Kings 1:14 And behold, while thou art still speaking there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and will confirm thy words. 1 Kings 1:15 So Bersabee went in to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old, and Abisag the Somanite was ministering to the king. 1 Kings 1:16 And Bersabee bowed, and did obeisance to the king; and the king said, What is thy request? 1 Kings 1:17 And she said, My lord, thou didst swear by the Lord thy God to thine handmaid, saying, Thy son Solomon shall reign after me, and shall sit upon my throne. 1 Kings 1:18 And now, behold, Adonias reigns, and thou, my lord, O king, knowest it not. 1 Kings 1:19 And he has sacrificed calves and lambs and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander-in-chief of the host; but Solomon thy servant he has not called. 1 Kings 1:20 And thou, my lord, O king,-the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, to tell them who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him. 1 Kings 1:21 And it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and Solomon my son shall be offenders. 1 Kings 1:22 And behold, while she was yet talking with the king, Nathan the prophet came. And it was reported to the king, 1 Kings 1:23 Behold, Nathan the prophet is here: and he came in to the king's presence, and did obeisance to the king with his face to the ground. 1 Kings 1:24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, didst thou say, Adonias shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? 1 Kings 1:25 For he has gone down to-day, and has sacrificed calves and lambs and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the chiefs of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and they said, Long live king Adonias. 1 Kings 1:26 But he has not invited me thy servant, and Sadoc the priest, and Banaeas the son of Jodae, and Solomon thy servant. 1 Kings 1:27 Has this matter happened by the authority of my lord the king, and hast thou not made known to thy servant who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him? 1 Kings 1:28 And king David answered and said, Call me Bersabee: and she came in before the king, and stood before him. 1 Kings 1:29 And the king swore, and said, As the Lord lives who redeemed my soul out of all affliction, 1 Kings 1:30 as I swore to thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead, so will I do this day. 1 Kings 1:31 And Bersabee bowed with her face to the ground, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever. 1 Kings 1:32 ¶ And king David said, Call me Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas the son of Jodae: and they came in before the king. 1 Kings 1:33 And the king said to them, Take the servants of your lord with you, and mount my son Solomon upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gion. 1 Kings 1:34 And there let Sadoc the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him to be king over Israel, and do ye sound the trumpet, and ye shall say, Let king Solomon live. 1 Kings 1:35 And he shall sit upon my throne, and reign in my stead: and I have given charge that he should be for a prince over Israel and Juda. 1 Kings 1:36 And Banaeas the son of Jodae answered the king and said, So let it be: may the Lord God of my lord the king confirm it. 1 Kings 1:37 As the Lord was with my lord the king, so let him be with Solomon, and let him exalt his throne beyond the throne of my lord king David. 1 Kings 1:38 And Sadoc the priest went down, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas son of Jodae, and the Cherethite, and the Phelethite, and they mounted Solomon upon the mule of king David, and led him away to Gion. 1 Kings 1:39 And Sadoc the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon, and blew the trumpet; and all the people said, Let king Solomon live. 1 Kings 1:40 And all the people went up after him, and they danced in choirs, and rejoiced with great joy, and the earth quaked with their voice. 1 Kings 1:41 ¶ And Adonias and all his guests heard, and they had just left off eating: and Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, and said, What means the voice of the city in tumult? 1 Kings 1:42 While he was yet speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came in: and Adonias said, Come in, for thou art a mighty man, and thou comest to bring glad tidings. 1 Kings 1:43 And Jonathan answered and said, Verily our lord king David has made Solomon king: 1 Kings 1:44 and the king has sent with him Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas the son of Jodae, and the Cherethite, and the Phelethite, and they have mounted him on the king's mule; 1 Kings 1:45 and Sadoc the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him in Gion, and have gone up thence rejoicing, and the city resounded: this is the sound which ye have heard. 1 Kings 1:46 And Solomon is seated upon the throne of the kingdom. 1 Kings 1:47 And the servants of the king have gone in to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne; and the king worshipped upon his bed. 1 Kings 1:48 Moreover thus said the king, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who has this day appointed one of my seed sitting on my throne, and my eyes see it. 1 Kings 1:49 And all the guests of Adonias were dismayed, and every man went his way. 1 Kings 1:50 And Adonias feared because of Solomon, and arose, and departed, and laid hold on the horns of the altar. 1 Kings 1:51 And it was reported to Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonias fears king Solomon, and holds the horns of the altar, saying, Let Solomon swear to me this day, that he will not slay his servant with the sword. 1 Kings 1:52 And Solomon said, If he should be a valiant man, there shall not a hair of his fall to the ground; but if evil be found in him, he shall die. 1 Kings 1:53 And king Solomon sent, and they brought him away from the altar; and he went in and did obeisance to king Solomon: and Solomon said to him, Go to thy house. 1 Kings 2:1 ¶ And the days of David drew near that he should die: and he addressed his son Solomon, saying, I go the way of all the earth: 1 Kings 2:2 but be thou strong, and shew thyself a man; 1 Kings 2:3 and keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep the commandments and the ordinances and the judgements which are written in the law of Moses; that thou mayest understand what thou shalt do in all things that I command thee: 1 Kings 2:4 that the Lord may confirm his word which he spoke, saying, If thy children shall take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart, I promise thee, saying, there shall not fail thee a man on the throne of Israel. 1 Kings 2:5 Moreover thou knowest all that Joab the son of Saruia did to me, what he did to the two captains of the forces of Israel, to Abenner the son of Ner, and to Amessai the son of Jether, that he slew them, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put innocent blood on his girdle that was about his loins, and on his sandal that was on his foot. 1 Kings 2:6 Therefore thou shalt deal with him according to thy wisdom, and thou shalt not bring down his grey hairs in peace to the grave. 1 Kings 2:7 But thou shalt deal kindly with the sons of Berzelli the Galaadite, and they shall be among those that eat at thy table; for thus they drew nigh to me when I fled from the face of thy brother Abessalom. 1 Kings 2:8 And, behold, there is with thee Semei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Baurim: and he cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went into the camp; and he came down to Jordan to meet me, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword. 1 Kings 2:9 But thou shalt by no means hold him guiltless, for thou art a wise man, and wilt know what thou shalt do to him, and shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to the grave. 1 Kings 2:10 And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. 1 Kings 2:11 And the days which David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Chebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 1 Kings 2:12 ¶ And Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was established greatly. 1 Kings 2:13 And Adonias the son of Aggith came in to Bersabee the mother of Solomon, and did obeisance to her: and she said, Dost thou enter peaceably? and he said, Peaceably: 1 Kings 2:14 I have business with thee. And she said to him, Say on. 1 Kings 2:15 And he said to her, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel turned their face toward me for a king; but the kingdom was turned from me and became my brother's: for it was appointed to him from the Lord. 1 Kings 2:16 And now I make one request of thee, do not turn away thy face. And Bersabee said to him, Speak on. 1 Kings 2:17 And he said to her, Speak, I pray thee, to king Solomon, for he will not turn away his face from thee, and let him give me Abisag the Somanite for a wife. 1 Kings 2:18 And Bersabee said, Well; I will speak for thee to the king. 1 Kings 2:19 And Bersabee went in to king Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonias; and the king rose up to meet her, and kissed her, and sat on the throne, and a throne was set for the mother of the king, and she sat on his right hand. 1 Kings 2:20 And she said to him, I ask of thee one little request; turn not away my face from thee. And the king said to her, Ask, my mother, and I will not reject thee. 1 Kings 2:21 And she said, Let, I pray thee, Abisag the Somanite be given to Adonias thy brother to wife. 1 Kings 2:22 And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why hast thou asked Abisag for Adonias? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother, and he has for his companion Abiathar the priest, and Joab the son of Saruia the commander-in-chief. 1 Kings 2:23 And king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if it be not that Adonias has spoken this word against his own life. 1 Kings 2:24 And now as the Lord lives who has established me, and set me on the throne of my father David, and he has made me a house, as the Lord spoke, this day shall Adonias be put to death. 1 Kings 2:25 So king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he slew him, and Adonias died in that day. 1 Kings 2:26 ¶ And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Depart thou quickly to Anathoth to thy farm, for thou art worthy of death this day; but I will not slay thee, because thou hast borne the ark of the covenant of the Lord before my father, and because thou was afflicted in all things wherein my father was afflicted. 1 Kings 2:27 And Solomon removed Abiathar from being a priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Heli in Selom. 1 Kings 2:28 And the report came to Joab son of Saruia; for Joab had turned after Adonias, and he went not after Solomon: and Joab fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar. 1 Kings 2:29 And it was told Solomon, saying, Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and lo! he has hold of the horns of the altar. And king Solomon sent to Joab, saying, What ails thee, that thou hast fled to the altar? and Joab said, Because I was afraid of thee, and fled for refuge to the Lord. And Solomon sent Banaeas son of Jodae, saying, Go and slay him, and bury him. 1 Kings 2:30 And Banaeas son of Jodae came to Joab to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And Joab said, I will not come forth, for I will die here. And Banaeas son of Jodae returned and spoke to the king, saying, Thus has Joab spoken, and thus has he answered me. 1 Kings 2:31 And the king said to him, Go, and do to him as he has spoken, and kill him: and thou shalt bury him, and thou shalt remove this day the blood which he shed without cause, from me and from the house of my father. 1 Kings 2:32 And the Lord has returned upon his own head the blood of his unrighteousness, inasmuch as he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew not of their blood, even Abenner the son of Ner the commander-in-chief of Israel, and Amessa the son of Jether the commander-in-chief of Juda. 1 Kings 2:33 And their blood is returned upon his head, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but to David, and his seed, and his house, and his throne, may there be peace for ever from the Lord. 1 Kings 2:34 So Banaeas son of Jodae went up, and attacked him, and slew him, and buried him in his house in the wilderness. 1 Kings 2:35 ¶ And the king appointed Banaeas son of Jodae in his place over the host; and the kingdom was established in Jerusalem; and as for Sadoc the priest, the king appointed him to be high priest in the room of Abiathar. And Solomon son of David reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem: and the Lord gave understanding to Solomon, and very much wisdom, and largeness of heart, as the sand by the sea-shore. 1 Kings 2:36 And the king called Semei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and thou shalt not go out thence any whither. 1 Kings 2:37 And it shall come to pass in the day that thou shalt go forth and cross over the brook Kedron, know assuredly that thou shalt certainly die: thy blood shall be upon thine head. And the king caused him to swear in that day. 1 Kings 2:38 And Semei said to the king, Good is the word that thou hast spoken, my lord O king: thus will thy servant do. And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem three years. 1 Kings 2:39 And it came to pass after the three years, that two servants of Semei ran away to Anchus son of Maacha king of Geth: and it was told Semei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Geth. 1 Kings 2:40 And Semei rose up, and saddled his ass, and went to Geth to Anchus to seek out his servants: and Semei went, and brought his servants out of Geth. 1 Kings 2:41 And it was told Solomon, saying, Semei is gone out of Jerusalem to Geth, and has brought back his servants. 1 Kings 2:42 And the king sent and called Semei, and said to him, Did I not adjure thee by the Lord, and testify to thee, saying, In whatsoever day thou shalt go out of Jerusalem, and go to the right or left, know certainly that thou shalt assuredly die? 1 Kings 2:43 And why hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment which I commanded thee? 1 Kings 2:44 And the king said to Semei, Thou knowest all thy mischief which thy heart knows, which thou didst to David my father: and the Lord has recompensed thy mischief on thine own head. 1 Kings 2:45 And king Solomon is blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever. 1 Kings 2:46"

So they spoke before the king. 1 Kings 3:23 and the king said to them, Thou sayest, This is my son, even the living one, and this woman's son is the dead one: and thou sayest, No, but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. 1 Kings 3:24 And the king said, Fetch a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. 1 Kings 3:25 And the king said, Divide the live child, the suckling, in two; and give half of it to one, and half of it to the other. 1 Kings 3:26 And the woman whose the living child was, answered and said to the king, (for her bowels yearned over her son) and she said, I pray thee, my lord, give her the child, and in nowise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor hers; divide it. 1 Kings 3:27 Then the king answered and said, Give the child to her that said, 'Give it to her, and by no means slay it:' she is its mother. 1 Kings 3:28 and all Israel heard this judgement which the king judged, and they feared before the king; because they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to execute judgement. 1 Kings 4:1 ¶ And king Solomon reigned over Israel. 1 Kings 4:2 And these are the princes which he had; Azarias son of Sadoc. 1 Kings 4:3 Eliaph, and Achia son of Seba, scribes; and Josaphat son of Achilud, recorder. 1 Kings 4:4 And Banaeas son of Jodae over the host; and Sadoc and Abiathar were priests. 1 Kings 4:5 And Ornia the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabuth son of Nathan was the king's friend. 1 Kings 4:6 And Achisar was steward, and Eliac the chief steward; and Eliab the son of Saph was over the family: and Adoniram the son of Audon over the tribute. 1 Kings 4:7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, to provide for the king and his household; each one's turn came to supply for a month in the year. 1 Kings 4:8 And these were their names: Been the son of Or in the mount of Ephraim, one. 1 Kings 4:9 The son of Dacar, in Makes, and in Salabin, and Baethsamys, and Elon as far as Bethanan, one. 1 Kings 4:10 The son of Esdi in Araboth; his was Socho, and all the land of Opher. 1 Kings 4:11 All Nephthador belonged to the son of Aminadab, Tephath daughter of Solomon was his wife, one. 1 Kings 4:12 Bana son of Achiluth had Ithaanach, and Mageddo, and his was the whole house of San which was by Sesathan below Esrae, and from Bethsan as far as Sabelmaula, as far as Maeber Lucam, one. 1 Kings 4:13 The son of Naber in Raboth Galaad, to him fell the lot of Ergab in Basan, sixty great cities with walls, and brazen bars, one. 1 Kings 4:14 Achinadab son of Saddo, had Maanaim. 1 Kings 4:15 Achimaas was in Nephthalim, and he took Basemmath daughter of Solomon to wife, one. 1 Kings 4:16 Baana son of Chusi, in Aser and in Baaloth, one, 1 Kings 4:17 Josaphat son of Phuasud was in Issachar. 1 Kings 4:18 Semei son of Ela, in Benjamin. 1 Kings 4:19 Gaber son of Adai in the land of Gad, the land of Seon king of Esebon, and of Og king of Basan, and one officer in the land of Juda. 1 Kings 4:20 ¶ 1 Kings 4:21 1 Kings 4:22 And these were the requisite supplies for Solomon: in one day thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of fine pounded meal, 1 Kings 4:23 and ten choice calves, and twenty pastured oxen, and a hundred sheep, besides stags, and choice fatted does. 1 Kings 4:24 For he had dominion on this side the river, and he was at peace on all sides round about. 1 Kings 4:25 1 Kings 4:26 1 Kings 4:27 And thus the officers provided king Solomon: and they execute every one in his month all the orders for the table of the king, they omit nothing. 1 Kings 4:28 And they carried the barley and the straw for the horses and the chariots to the place where the king might be, each according to his charge. 1 Kings 4:29 ¶ And the Lord gave understanding to Solomon, and very much wisdom, and enlargement of heart, as the sand on the seashore. 1 Kings 4:30 And Solomon abounded greatly beyond the wisdom of all the ancients, and beyond all the wise men of Egypt. 1 Kings 4:31 And he was wiser than all other men: and he was wiser than Gaethan the Zarite, and than Aenan, and than Chalcad and Darala the son of Mal. 1 Kings 4:32 And Solomon spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were five thousand. 1 Kings 4:33 And he spoke of trees, from the cedar in Libanus even to the hyssop which comes out through the wall: he spoke also of cattle, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of fishes. 1 Kings 4:34 And all the nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and ambassadors from all the kings of the"

(6:18) And the men of Solomon, and the men of Chiram hewed the stones, and laid them for a foundation. (6:1) In the fourth year he laid the foundation of the house of the Lord, in the month Ziu, even in the second month. (6:38) In the eleventh year, in the month Baal, this is the eighth month, the house was completed according to all its plan, and according to all its arrangement. 1 Kings 6:2 And the house which the king built to the Lord was forty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and its height five and twenty cubits. 1 Kings 6:3 And the porch in front of the temple-twenty cubits was its length according to the breadth of the house in front of the house: and he built the house, and finished it. 1 Kings 6:4 And he made to the house secret windows inclining inward. 1 Kings 6:5 And against the wall of the house he set chambers round about the temple and the ark. 1 Kings 6:6 The under side was five cubits broad, and the middle part six, and the third was seven cubits broad; for he formed an interval to the house round about without the house, that they might not touch the walls of the house. 1 Kings 6:7 And the house was built in the construction of it with rough hewn stones: and there was not heard in the house in the building of it hammer or axe, or any iron tool. 1 Kings 6:8 And the porch of the under side was below the right wing of the house, and there was a winding ascent into the middle chamber, and from the middle to the third story. 1 Kings 6:9 So he built the house and finished it; and he made the ceiling of the house with cedars. 1 Kings 6:10 And he made the partitions through all the house, each five cubits high, and enclosed each partition with cedar boards. 1 Kings 6:11 ¶ 1 Kings 6:12 1 Kings 6:13 1 Kings 6:14 1 Kings 6:15 ¶ And he framed the walls of the house within with cedar boards, from the floor of the house and on to the inner walls and to the beams: he lined the parts enclosed with boards within, and compassed the inward parts of the house with planks of fir. 1 Kings 6:16 And he built the twenty cubits from the top of the wall, one side from the floor to the beams, and he made it from the oracle to the most holy place. 1 Kings 6:17 And the temple was forty cubits in extent, 1 Kings 6:18 1 Kings 6:19 in front of the oracle in the midst of the house within, in order to put there the ark of the covenant of the Lord. 1 Kings 6:20 The length was twenty cubits, and the breadth was twenty cubits, and the height of it was twenty cubits. And he covered it with perfect gold, and he made an altar in front of the oracle, and covered it with gold. 1 Kings 6:21 1 Kings 6:22 (6:21) And he covered the whole house with gold, till he had finished gilding the whole house. 1 Kings 6:23 And he made in the oracle two cherubs of ten cubits measured size. 1 Kings 6:24 And the wing of one cherub was five cubits, and his other wing was five cubits; ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing. 1 Kings 6:25 Thus it was with the other cherub, both were alike finished with one measure. 1 Kings 6:26 And the height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it with the second cherub. 1 Kings 6:27 And both the cherubs were in the midst of the innermost part of the house; and they spread out their wings, and one wing touched the wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings in the midst of the house touched each other. 1 Kings 6:28 And he covered the cherubs with gold. 1 Kings 6:29 He graved all the walls of the house round about with the graving of cherubs, and he sculptured palm trees within and without the house. 1 Kings 6:30 And he covered the floor of the house within and without with gold. 1 Kings 6:31 And for the door-way of the oracle he made doors of juniper wood, there were porches in a four- fold way. 1 Kings 6:32 1 Kings 6:33 1 Kings 6:34 In both the doors were planks of fir; the one door had two leaves and their hinges, and the other door had two leaves and turned on hinges, 1 Kings 6:35 being carved with cherubs, and there were palm-trees and open flower-leaves, and it was overlaid with gold gilt upon the engraving. 1 Kings 6:36 And he built the inner court, three rows of hewn stones, and a row of wrought cedar round about,"
Ruth,4,36,"A) and he made the curtain of the court of the porch of the house that was in front of the temple. 1 Kings 6:37 1 Kings 6:38 1 Kings 7:1 ¶ And Solomon built a house for himself in thirteen years. 1 Kings 7:2 And he built the house with the wood of Libanus; its length was a hundred cubits, and its breadth was fifty cubits, and its height was of thirty cubits, and it was made with three rows of cedar pillars, and the pillars had side-pieces of cedar. 1 Kings 7:3 And he formed the house with chambers above on the sides of the pillars, and the number of the pillars was each row forty and five, 1 Kings 7:4 and there were three chambers, and space against space in three rows. 1 Kings 7:5 And all the doors and spaces formed like chambers were square, and from door to door was a correspondence in three rows. 1 Kings 7:6 And he made the porch of the pillars, they were fifty cubits long and fifty broad, the porch joining them in front; and the other pillars and the thick beam were in front of the house by the porches. 1 Kings 7:7 And there was the Porch of seats where he would judge, the porch of judgement. 1 Kings 7:8 And their house where he would dwell, had one court communicating with these according to this work; and he built the house for the daughter of Pharao whom Solomon had taken, according to this porch. 1 Kings 7:9 All these were of costly stones, sculptured at intervals within even from the foundation even to the top, and outward to the great court, 1 Kings 7:10 founded with large costly stones, stones of ten cubits and eight cubits long. 1 Kings 7:11 And above with costly stones, according to the measure of hewn stones, and with cedars. 1 Kings 7:12 There were three rows of hewn stones round about the great hall, and a row of sculptured cedar: and Solomon finished all his house. 1 Kings 7:13 ¶ And king Solomon sent, and took Chiram out of Tyre, 1 Kings 7:14 the son of a widow woman; and he was of the tribe of Nephthalim, and his father was a Tyrian; a worker in brass, and accomplished in art and skill and knowledge to work every work in brass: and he was brought in to king Solomon, and he wrought all the works. 1 Kings 7:15 And he cast the two pillars for the porch of the house: eighteen cubits was the height of each pillar, and a circumference of fourteen cubits encompassed it, even the thickness of the pillar: the flutings were four fingers wide, and thus was the other pillar formed. 1 Kings 7:16 And he made two molten chapiters to put on the heads of the pillars: five cubits was the height of one chapiter, and five cubits was the height of the other chapiter. 1 Kings 7:17 And he made two ornaments of net-work to cover the chapiters of the pillars; even a net for one chapiter, and a net for the other chapiter. 1 Kings 7:18 And hanging work, two rows of brazen pomegranates, formed with net-work, hanging work, row upon row: and thus he framed the ornaments for the second chapiter. 1 Kings 7:19 And on the heads of the pillars he made lily-work against the porch, of four cubits, 1 Kings 7:20"
Ruth,4,19,"A) and a chamber over both the pillars, and above the sides an addition equal to the chamber in width. 1 Kings 7:21 And he set up the pillars of the porch of the temple: and he set up the one pillar, and called its name Jachum: and he set up the second pillar, and called its name Boloz. 1 Kings 7:22 1 Kings 7:23 And he made the sea, ten cubits from one rim to the other, the same was completely circular round about: its height was five cubits, and its circumference thirty-three cubits. 1 Kings 7:24 And stays underneath its rim round about compassed it ten cubits round; 1 Kings 7:25 And there were twelve oxen under the sea: three looking to the north, and three looking to the west, and three looking to the south, and three looking to the east: and all their hinder parts were inward, and the sea was above upon them. 1 Kings 7:26"
Ruth,4,24,"A) and its rim was as the work of the rim of a cup, a lily-flower, and the thickness of it was a span. 1 Kings 7:27 And he made ten brazen bases: five cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and its height was six cubits. 1 Kings 7:28 And this work of the bases was formed with a border the them, and there was a border between the ledges. 1 Kings 7:29 And upon their borders between the projection were lions, and oxen, and cherubs: and on the projections, even so above, and also below were the places of lions and oxen, hanging work. 1 Kings 7:30 And there were four brazen wheels to one base; and there were brazen bases, and their four sides answering to them, side pieces under the bases. 1 Kings 7:31 And there were axles in the wheels under the base. 1 Kings 7:32 And the height of one wheel was a cubit and a half. 1 Kings 7:33 And the work of the wheels was as the work of chariot wheels: their axles, and their felloes, and the rest of their work, were all molten. 1 Kings 7:34 The four side pieces were at the four corners of each base; its shoulders were formed of the base. 1 Kings 7:35 And on the top of the base half a cubit was the size of it, there was a circle on the top of the base, and there was the top of its spaces and its borders: and it was open at the top of its spaces. 1 Kings 7:36 And its borders were cherubs, and lions, and palm-trees, upright, each was joined in front and within and round about. 1 Kings 7:37 According to the same form he made all the ten bases, even one order and one measure to all. 1 Kings 7:38 And he made ten brazen lavers, each laver containing forty baths, and measuring four cubits, each laver placed on a several base throughout the ten bases. 1 Kings 7:39 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and the sea was placed on the right side of the house eastward in the direction of the south. 1 Kings 7:40 And Chiram made the caldrons, and the pans, and the bowls; and Chiram finished making all the works that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of the Lord: 1 Kings 7:41 two pillars and the wreathen works of the pillars on the heads of the two pillars; and the two net- works to cover both the wreathen works of the flutings that were upon the pillars. 1 Kings 7:42 The four hundred pomegranates for both the net-works, two rows of pomegranates for one net- work, to cover both the wreathen works of the bases belonging to both pillars. 1 Kings 7:43 And the ten bases, and the ten lavers upon the bases. 1 Kings 7:44 And one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea. 1 Kings 7:45 And the caldrons, and pans, and bowls, and all the furniture, which Chiram made for king Solomon for the house of the Lord: and there were eight and forty pillars of the house of the king and of the house of the Lord: all the works of the king which Chiram made were entirely of brass. 1 Kings 7:46 In the country round about Jordan did he cast them, in the clay land between Socchoth and Sira. 1 Kings 7:47 There was no reckoning of the brass of which he made all these works, from the very great abundance, there was no end of the weight of the brass. 1 Kings 7:48 ¶ And king Solomon took the furniture which Chiram made for the house of the Lord, the golden altar, and the golden table of shewbread. 1 Kings 7:49 And he put the five candlesticks on the left, and five on the right in front of the oracle, being of pure gold, and the lamp-stands, and the lamps, and the snuffers of gold. 1 Kings 7:50 And there were made the porches, and the nails, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the golden censers, of pure gold: and the panels of the doors of the innermost part of the house, even the holy of holies, and the golden doors of the temple. 1 Kings 7:51 So the work of the house of the Lord which Solomon wrought was finished; and Solomon brought in the holy things of David his father, and all the holy things of Solomon; he put the silver, and the gold, and the furniture, into the treasures of the house of the Lord. 1 Kings 8:1 ¶ And it came to pass when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord and his own house after twenty years, then king Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel in Sion, to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, this is Sion, 1 Kings 8:2 in the month of Athanin. 1 Kings 8:3 And the priests took up the ark, 1 Kings 8:4 and the tabernacle of testimony, and the holy furniture that was in the tabernacle of testimony. 1 Kings 8:5 And the king and all Israel were occupied before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, without number. 1 Kings 8:6 And the priests bring in the ark into its place, into the oracle of the house, even into the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubs. 1 Kings 8:7 For the cherubs spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubs covered the ark and its holy things above. 1 Kings 8:8 And the holy staves projected, and the ends of the holy staves appeared out of the holy places in front of the oracle, and were not seen without. 1 Kings 8:9 There was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which Moses put there in Choreb, which tables the Lord made as a covenant with the children of Israel in their going forth from the land of Egypt. 1 Kings 8:10 And it came to pass when the priests departed out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house. 1 Kings 8:11 And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, because the glory of the Lord filled the house. 1 Kings 8:12 ¶ 1 Kings 8:13 1 Kings 8:14 And the king turned his face, and the king blessed all Israel, (and the whole assembly of Israel stood:) 1 Kings 8:15 and he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel to-day, who spoke by his mouth concerning David my father, and has fulfilled it with his hands, saying, 1 Kings 8:16 From the day that I brought out my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any one tribe of Israel to build a house, so that my name should be there: but I chose Jerusalem that my name should be there, and I chose David to be over my people Israel. 1 Kings 8:17 And it was in the heart of my father to build a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel. 1 Kings 8:18 And the Lord said to David my father, Forasmuch as it came into thine heart to build a house to my name, thou didst well that it came upon thine heart. 1 Kings 8:19 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house, but thy son that has proceeded out of thy bowels, he shall build the house to my name. 1 Kings 8:20 And the Lord has confirmed the word that he spoke, and I am risen up in the place of my father David, and I have sat down on the throne of Israel, as the Lord spoke, and I have built the house to the name of the Lord God of Israel. 1 Kings 8:21 And I have set there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord, which the Lord made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. 1 Kings 8:22 ¶ And Solomon stood up in front of the altar before all the congregation of Israel; and he spread out his hands toward heaven: 1 Kings 8:23 and he said, Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heaven above and on the earth beneath, keeping covenant and mercy with thy servant who walks before thee with all his heart; 1 Kings 8:24 which thou hast kept toward thy servant David my father: for thou hast spoken by thy mouth and thou hast fulfilled it with thine hands, as at this day. 1 Kings 8:25 And now, O Lord God of Israel, keep for thy servant David my father, the promises which thou hast spoken to him, saying, There shall not be taken from thee a man sitting before me on the throne of Israel, provided only thy children shall take heed to their ways, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me. 1 Kings 8:26 And now, O Lord God of Israel, let, I pray thee, thy word to David my father be confirmed. 1 Kings 8:27 But will God indeed dwell with men upon the earth? if the heaven and heaven of heavens will not suffice thee, how much less even this house which I have built to thy name? 1 Kings 8:28 Yet, O Lord God of Israel, thou shalt look upon my petition, to hear the prayer which thy servant prays to thee in thy presence this day, 1 Kings 8:29 that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place which thou saidst, My name shall be there, to hear the prayer which thy servant prays at this place day and night. 1 Kings 8:30 And thou shalt hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall pray toward this place; and thou shalt hear in thy dwelling-place in heaven, and thou shalt do and be gracious. 1 Kings 8:31 Whatsoever trespasses any one shall commit against his neighbor,-and if he shall take upon him an oath so that he should swear, and he shall come and make confession before thine altar in this house, 1 Kings 8:32 then shalt thou hear from heaven, and do, and thou shalt judge thy people Israel, that the wicked should be condemned, to recompense his way upon his head; and to justify the righteous, to give to him according to his righteousness. 1 Kings 8:33 When thy people Israel falls before enemies, because they shall sin against thee, and they shall return and confess to thy name, and they shall pray and supplicate in this house, 1 Kings 8:34 then shalt thou hear from heaven, and be gracious to the sins of thy people Israel, and thou shalt restore them to the land which thou gavest to their fathers. 1 Kings 8:35 When the heaven is restrained, and there is no rain, because they shall sin against thee, and the shall pray toward this place, and they shall make confession to thy name, and shall turn from their sins when thou shalt have humbled them, 1 Kings 8:36 then thou shalt hear from heaven, and be merciful to the sins of thy servant and of thy people Israel; for thou shalt shew them the good way to walk in it, and thou shalt give rain upon the earth which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. 1 Kings 8:37 If there should be famine, if there should be death, because there should be blasting, locust, or if there be mildew, and if their enemy oppress them in any one of their cities, with regard to every calamity, every trouble, 1 Kings 8:38 every prayer, every supplication whatever shall be made by any man, as they shall know each the plague of his heart, and shall spread abroad his hands to this house, 1 Kings 8:39 then shalt thou hearken from heaven, out of thine established dwelling-place, and shalt be merciful, and shalt do, and recompense to every man according to his ways, as thou shalt know his heart, for thou alone knowest the heart of all the children of men: 1 Kings 8:40 that they may fear thee all the days that they live upon the land, which thou hast given to our fathers. 1 Kings 8:41 And for the stranger who is not of thy people, 1 Kings 8:42 when they shall come and pray toward this place, 1 Kings 8:43 then shalt thou hear them from heaven, out of thine established dwelling-place, and thou shalt do according to all that the stranger shall call upon thee for, that all the nations may know thy name, and fear thee, as do thy people Israel, and may know that thy name has been called on this house which I have builded. 1 Kings 8:44 If it be that thy people shall go forth to war against their enemies in the way by which thou shalt turn them, and pray in the name of the Lord toward the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built to thy name, 1 Kings 8:45 then shalt thou hear from heaven their supplication and their prayer, and shalt execute judgment for them. 1 Kings 8:46 If it be that they shall sin against thee, (for there is not a man who will not sin,) and thou shalt bring them and deliver them up before their enemies, and they that take them captive shall carry them to a land far or near, 1 Kings 8:47 and they shall turn their hearts in the land whither they have been carried captives, and turn in the land of their sojourning, and supplicate thee, saying, We have sinned, we have done unjustly, we have transgressed, 1 Kings 8:48 and they shall turn to thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies whither thou hast carried them captives, and shall pray to thee toward their land which thou hast given to their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built to thy name: 1 Kings 8:49 then shalt thou hear from heaven thine established dwelling-place, 1 Kings 8:50 and thou shalt be merciful to their unrighteousness wherein they have trespassed against thee, and according to all their transgressions wherewith they have transgressed against thee, and thou shalt cause them to be pitied before them that carried them captives, and they shall have compassion on them: 1 Kings 8:51 for they are thy people and thine inheritance, whom thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, out of the midst of the furnace of iron. 1 Kings 8:52 And let thine eyes and thine ears be opened to the supplication of thy servant, and to the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken to them in all things for which they shall call upon thee. 1 Kings 8:53 Because thou hast set them apart for an inheritance to thyself out of all the nations of the earth, as thou spokest by the hand of thy servant Moses, when thou broughtest our fathers out of the land of"
Ruth,4,53,"A) Then spoke Solomon concerning the house, when he had finished building it-He manifested the sun in the heaven: the Lord said he would dwell in darkness: build thou my house, a beautiful house for thyself to dwell in anew. Behold, is not this written in the book of the song? 1 Kings 8:54 ¶ And it came to pass when Solomon had finished praying to the Lord all this prayer and supplication, that he rose up from before the altar of the Lord, after having knelt upon his knees, and his hands were spread out towards heaven. 1 Kings 8:55 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 1 Kings 8:56 Blessed be the Lord this day, who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he said: there has not failed one word among all his good words which he spoke by the hand of his servant Moses. 1 Kings 8:57 May the Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers; let him not desert us nor turn from us, 1 Kings 8:58 that he may turn our hearts toward him to walk in all his ways, and to keep all his commandments, and his ordinances which he commanded our fathers. 1 Kings 8:59 And let these words, which I have prayed before the Lord our God, be near to the Lord our God day and night, to maintain the cause of thy servant, and the cause of thy people Israel for ever. 1 Kings 8:60 that all the nations of the earth may know that the Lord God, he is God, and there is none beside. 1 Kings 8:61 And let our hearts be perfect toward the Lord our God, to walk also holily in his ordinances, and to keep his commandments, as at this day. 1 Kings 8:62 ¶ And the king and all the children of Israel offered sacrifice before the Lord. 1 Kings 8:63 And king Solomon offered for the sacrifices of peace-offering which he sacrificed to the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and hundred and twenty thousand sheep: and the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord. 1 Kings 8:64 In that day the king consecrated the middle of the court in the front of the house of the Lord; for there he offered the whole-burnt-offering, and the sacrifices, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which was before the Lord was too little to bear the whole-burnt-offering and the sacrifices of peace-offerings. 1 Kings 8:65 And Solomon kept the feast in that day, and all Israel with him, even a great assembly from the entering in of Hemath to the river of Egypt, before the Lord our God in the house which he built, eating and drinking, and rejoicing before the Lord our God seven days. 1 Kings 8:66 And on the eighth day he sent away the people: and they blessed the king, and each departed to his tabernacle rejoicing, and their heart was glad because of the good things which the Lord had done to his servant David, and to Israel his people. 1 Kings 9:1 ¶ And it came to pass when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the work of Solomon, whatever he wished to perform, 1 Kings 9:2 that the Lord appeared to Solomon a second time, as he appeared in Gabaon. 1 Kings 9:3 And the Lord said to him, I have heard the voice of thy prayer, and thy supplication which thou madest before me: I have done for thee according to all thy prayer: I have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever, and mine eyes and my heart shall be there always. 1 Kings 9:4 And if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father walked, in holiness of heart and uprightness, and so as to do according to all that I commanded him, and shalt keep my ordinances and my commandments: 1 Kings 9:5 then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom in Israel for ever, as I spoke to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to rule in Israel. 1 Kings 9:6 But if ye or your children do in any wise revolt from me, and do not keep my commandments and my ordinances, which Moses set before you, and ye go and serve other gods, and worship them: 1 Kings 9:7 then will I cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and this house which I have consecrated to my name I will cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a desolation and a by-word to all nations. 1 Kings 9:8 And this house, which is high, shall be so that every one that passes by it shall be amazed, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Wherefore has the Lord done thus to this land, and to this house? 1 Kings 9:9 And men shall say, Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought out their fathers from Egypt, out of the house of bondage, and they attached themselves to strange gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore the Lord has brought this evil upon them. 1 Kings 9:10 ¶ During twenty years in which Solomon was building the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the house of the king, 1 Kings 9:11 Chiram king of Tyre helped Solomon with cedar wood, and fir wood, and with gold, and all that he wished for: then the king gave Chiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 1 Kings 9:12 So Chiram departed from Tyre, and went into Galilee to see the cities which Solomon gave to him; and they pleased him not. And he said, 1 Kings 9:13 What are these cities which thou hast given me, brother? And he called them Boundary until this day. 1 Kings 9:14 And Chiram brought to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold, 1 Kings 9:15"
Ruth,4,22,"A) This was the arrangement of the provision which king Solomon fetched to build the house of the Lord, and the house of the king, and the wall of Jerusalem, and the citadel; to fortify the city of David, and Assur, and Magdal, and Gazer, and Baethoron the upper, and Jethermath, and all the cities of the chariots, and all the cities of the horsemen, and the fortification of Solomon which he purposed to build in Jerusalem and in all the land, 1 Kings 9:16 1 Kings 9:17 1 Kings 9:18 1 Kings 9:19 1 Kings 9:20"

Ruth,4,22,"C) But of the children of Israel Solomon made nothing; for they were the warriors, and his servants and rulers, and captains of the third order, and the captains of his chariots, and his horsemen. 1 Kings 9:23 1 Kings 9:24"
Ruth,4,9,"A) Then Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharao out of the city of David into his house which he built for himself in those days, 1 Kings 9:25 1 Kings 9:26 even that for which king Solomon built a ship in Gasion Gaber near Aelath on the shore of the extremity of the sea in the land of Edom. 1 Kings 9:27 And Chiram sent in the ship together with the servants of Solomon servants of his own, mariners to row, men acquainted with the sea. 1 Kings 9:28 And they came to Sophira, and took thence a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon. 1 Kings 10:1 ¶ And the queen of Saba heard of the name of Solomon, and the name of the Lord, and she came to try him with riddles. 1 Kings 10:2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train; and there came camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and she came in to Solomon, and told him all that was in her heart. 1 Kings 10:3 And Solomon answered all her questions: and there was not a question overlooked by the king which he did not answer her. 1 Kings 10:4 And the queen of Saba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he built, 1 Kings 10:5 and the provision of Solomon and the sitting of his attendants, and the standing of his servants, and his raiment, and his cup-bearers, and his whole-burnt-offering which he offered in the house of the Lord, and she was utterly amazed. 1 Kings 10:6 And she said to king Solomon, It was a true report which I heard in my land of thy words and thy wisdom. 1 Kings 10:7 But I believed not them that told me, until I came and my eyes saw: and, behold, the words as they reported to me are not the half: thou hast exceeded in goodness all the report which I heard in my land. 1 Kings 10:8 Blessed are thy wives, blessed are these thy servants who stand before thee continually, who hear all thy wisdom. 1 Kings 10:9 Blessed be the Lord thy God, who has taken pleasure in thee, to set thee upon the throne of Israel, because the Lord loved Israel to establish him for ever; and he has made thee king over them, to execute judgment with justice, and in their causes. 1 Kings 10:10 And she gave to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and very many spices, and precious stones: there had not come any other spices so abundant as those which the queen of Saba gave to king Solomon. 1 Kings 10:11 And the ship of Chiram which brought the gold from Suphir, brought very much hewn timber and precious stones. 1 Kings 10:12 And the king made the hewn timber into buttresses of the house of the Lord and the king's house, and lyres and harps for singers: such hewn timber had not come upon the earth, nor have been seen anywhere until this day. 1 Kings 10:13 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Saba all that she desired, whatsoever she asked, besides all that he had given her by the hand of king Solomon: and she returned, and came into her own land, she and her servants. 1 Kings 10:14 ¶ And the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold. 1 Kings 10:15 Besides the tributes of them that were subjects, both merchants and all the kings of the country beyond the river, and of the princess of the land. 1 Kings 10:16 And Solomon made three hundred spears of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold were upon one spear. 1 Kings 10:17 And three hundred shields of beaten gold: and three pounds of gold were in one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 1 Kings 10:18 And the king made a great ivory throne, and gilded it with pure gold. 1 Kings 10:19 The throne had six steps, and calves in bold relief to the throne behind it, and side-pieces on either hand of the place of the seat, and two lions standing by the side-pieces, 1 Kings 10:20 and twelve lions standing there on the six steps on either side: it was not so done in any other kingdom. 1 Kings 10:21 And all the vessels made by Solomon were of gold, and the lavers were golden, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; there was no silver, for it was not accounted of in the days of Solomon. 1 Kings 10:22 For Solomon had a ship of Tharsis in the sea with the ships of Chiram: one ship came to the king every three years out of Tharsis, laden with gold and silver, and wrought stones, and hewn stones. 1 Kings 10:23 And Solomon increased beyond all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom. 1 Kings 10:24 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which the Lord had put into his heart. 1 Kings 10:25 And they brought every one their gifts, vessels of gold, and raiment, and stacte, and spices, and horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 1 Kings 10:26 And Solomon had four thousand mares for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he put"
Ruth,4,26,"A) and he ruled over all the kings from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt. 1 Kings 10:27 And the king made gold and silver in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as the sycamores in the plain for multitude. 1 Kings 10:28 And the goings forth of Solomon's horsemen was also out of Egypt, and the king's merchants were of Thecue; and they received them out of Thecue at a price. 1 Kings 10:29 And that which proceeded out of Egypt went up thus, even a chariot for a hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for fifty shekels of silver: and thus for all the kings of the Chettians, and the kings of Syria, they came out by sea. 1 Kings 11:1 ¶ And king Solomon was a lover of women. (11:1) And he took strange women, as well as the daughter of Pharao, Moabitish, Ammanitish women, Syrians and Idumeans, Chettites, and Amorites; 1 Kings 11:2 of the nations concerning whom the Lord forbade the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall not go in to them, and they shall not come in to you, lest they turn away your hearts after their idols: Solomon clave to these in love. 1 Kings 11:3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. (11:3) And the strange women turned away his heart after their gods. 1 Kings 11:4 And it came to pass in the time of the old age of Solomon, that his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father. 1 Kings 11:5"
Ruth,4,7,"A) and to Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians. 1 Kings 11:6 And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he went not after the Lord, as David his father. 1 Kings 11:7 Then Solomon built a high place to Chamos the idol of Moab, and to their king the idol of the children of Ammon, 1 Kings 11:8 And thus he acted towards all his strange wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their idols. 1 Kings 11:9 ¶ And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because he turned away his heart from the Lord God of Israel, who had appeared twice to him, 1 Kings 11:10 and charged him concerning this matter, by no means to go after other gods, but to take heed to do what the Lord God commanded him; neither was his heart perfect with the Lord, according to the heart of David his father. 1 Kings 11:11 And the Lord said to Solomon, Because it has been thus with thee, and thou hast not kept my commandments and my ordinances which I commanded thee, I will surely rend thy kingdom out of thy hand, and give it to thy servant. 1 Kings 11:12 Only in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will take it out of the hand of thy son. 1 Kings 11:13 Only I will not take away the whole kingdom: I will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen. 1 Kings 11:14 ¶ And the Lord raised up and enemy to Solomon, Ader the Idumaean, and Esrom son of Eliadae who dwelt in Raama, and Adadezer king of Suba his master; (and men gathered to him, and he was head of the conspiracy, and he seized on Damasec,) and they were adversaries to Israel all the days of Solomon: and Ader the Idumaean was of the seed royal in Idumaea. 1 Kings 11:15 And it happened, that while David was utterly destroying Edom, while Joab captain of the host was going to bury the dead, when they slew every male in Idumaea; 1 Kings 11:16 (for Joab and all Israel abode there six months in Idumaea, until he utterly destroyed every male in Idumaea;) 1 Kings 11:17 that Ader ran away, he and all the Idumaeans of the servants of his father with him; and they went into Egypt; and Ader was then a little child. 1 Kings 11:18 And there rise up men out of the city of Madiam, and they come to Pharan, and take men with them, and come to Pharao king of Egypt: and Ader went in to Pharao, and he gave him a house, and appointed him provision. 1 Kings 11:19 And Ader found great favour in the sight of Pharao, and he gave him his wife's sister in marriage, the elder sister of Thekemina. 1 Kings 11:20 And the sister of Thekemina bore to him, even to Ader, Ganebath her son; and Thekemina brought him up in the midst of the sons of Pharao, and Ganebath was in the midst of the sons of Pharao. 1 Kings 11:21 And Ader heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead; and Ader said to Pharao, Let me go, and I will return to my country. 1 Kings 11:22 And Pharao said to Ader, What lackest thou with me? that lo! thou seekest to depart to thy country? and Ader said to him, By all means let me go. 1 Kings 11:23 1 Kings 11:24 1 Kings 11:25"
Ruth,4,22,"A) So Ader returned to his country; this is the mischief which Ader did, and he was a bitter enemy of Israel, and he reigned in the land of Edom. 1 Kings 11:26 ¶ And Jeroboam the son of Nabat, the Ephrathite of Sarira, the son of a widow, was servant of Solomon. 1 Kings 11:27 And this was the occasion of his lifting up his hands against king Solomon: now king Solomon built the citadel, he completed the fortification of the city of David his father. 1 Kings 11:28 And the man Jeroboam was very strong; and Solomon saw the young man that he was active, and he set him over the levies of the house of Joseph. 1 Kings 11:29 And it came to pass at that time, that Jeroboam went forth from Jerusalem, and Achia the Selonite the prophet found him in the way, and caused him to turn aside out of the way: and Achia was clad with a new garment, and they two were alone in the field. 1 Kings 11:30 And Achia laid hold of his new garment that was upon him, and tore it into twelve pieces: 1 Kings 11:31 and he said to Jeroboam, Take to thyself ten pieces, for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give thee ten tribes. 1 Kings 11:32 Yet he shall have two tribes, for my servant David's sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel. 1 Kings 11:33 Because he forsook me, and sacrificed to Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians, and to Chamos, and to the idols of Moab, and to their king the abomination of the children of Ammon, and he walked not in my ways, to do that which was right before me, as David his father did. 1 Kings 11:34 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, (for I will certainly resist him all the days of his life,) for David my servant's sake, whom I have chosen. 1 Kings 11:35 But I will take the kingdom out of the hand of his son, and give thee ten tribes. 1 Kings 11:36 But to his son I will give the two remaining tribes, that my servant David may have an establishment continually before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for myself to put my name there. 1 Kings 11:37 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign as thy soul desires, and thou shalt be king over Israel. 1 Kings 11:38 And it shall come to pass, if thou wilt keep all the commandments that I shall give thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right before me, to keep my ordinances and my commandments, as David my servant did, that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built to David. 1 Kings 11:39 1 Kings 11:40 And Solomon sought to slay Jeroboam: but he arose and fled into Egypt, to Susakim king of Egypt, and he was in Egypt until Solomon died. 1 Kings 11:41 ¶ And the rest of the history of Solomon, and all that he did, and all his wisdom, behold are not these things written in the book of the life of Solomon? 1 Kings 11:42 And the days during which Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel were forty years. 1 Kings 11:43 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David his father. And it came to pass when Jeroboam son of Nabat heard of it, even while he was yet in Egypt as he fled from the face of Solomon and dwelt in Egypt, he straightway comes into his own city, into the land of Sarira in the mount of Ephraim. (11:44) And king Solomon slept with his fathers, and Roboam his son reigned in his stead. 1 Kings 12:1 ¶ And king Roboam goes to Sikima; for all Israel were coming to Sikima to make him king. 1 Kings 12:2 1 Kings 12:3 And the people spoke to king Roboam, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy; 1 Kings 12:4 but do thou now lighten somewhat of the hard service of thy father, and of his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve thee. 1 Kings 12:5 And he said to them, Depart for three days, and return to me. And they departed. 1 Kings 12:6 And the king referred the matter to the elders, who stood before Solomon his father while he was yet living, saying, How do ye advise that I should answer this people? 1 Kings 12:7 And they spoke to him, saying, If thou wilt this day be a servant to this people, and wilt serve them, and wilt speak to them good words, then will they be thy servants continually. 1 Kings 12:8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they gave him, and consulted with the young men who were brought up with him, who stood in his presence. 1 Kings 12:9 And he said to them, What counsel do ye give? And what shall I answer to this people who speak to me, saying, Lighten somewhat of the yoke which thy father has put upon us? 1 Kings 12:10 And the young men who had been brought up with him, who stood before his face, spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou say to this people who have spoken to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and do thou now lighten it from off us: thus shalt say to them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins. 1 Kings 12:11 And whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I also will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 1 Kings 12:12 And all Israel came to king Roboam on the third day, as the king spoke to them, saying, Return to me on the third day. 1 Kings 12:13 And the king answered the people harshly; and Roboam forsook the counsel of the old men which they counselled him. 1 Kings 12:14 And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 1 Kings 12:15 And the king hearkened not to the people, because the change was from the Lord, that he might establish his word which he spoke by Achia the Selonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nabat. 1 Kings 12:16 ¶ And all Israel saw that the king did not hearken to them: and the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jessae. Depart, O Israel, to thy tents: now feed thine own house, David. So Israel departed to his tents. 1 Kings 12:17 1 Kings 12:18 And the king sent Adoniram who was over the tribute; and they stoned him with stones, and he died: and king Roboam made haste to rise to flee to Jerusalem. 1 Kings 12:19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David until this day. 1 Kings 12:20 And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned out of Egypt, that they sent and called him to the assembly, and they made him king over Israel: and none followed the house of David except the tribe of Juda and Benjamin only. 1 Kings 12:21 And Roboam went into Jerusalem, and he assembled the congregation of Juda, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and twenty thousand young men, warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to recover the kingdom to Roboam the son of Solomon. 1 Kings 12:22 And the word of the Lord came to Samaia the man of God, saying, 1 Kings 12:23 Speak to Roboam the son of Solomon, king of Juda, and to all the house of Juda and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 1 Kings 12:24 Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, neither shall ye fight with your brethren the sons of Israel: return each man to his own home; for this thing is from me; and they hearkened to the word of the Lord, and they ceased from going up, according to the word of the Lord. 1 Kings 12:25 ¶ And Jeroboam built Sikima in mount Ephraim and dwelt in it, and went forth thence and built Phanuel. 1 Kings 12:26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Behold, now the kingdom will return to the house of David. 1 Kings 12:27 If this people shall go up to offer sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then the heart of the people will return to the Lord, and to their master, to Roboam king of Juda, and they will slay me. 1 Kings 12:28 And the king took counsel, and went, and made two golden heifers, and said to the people, Let it suffice you to have gone hitherto to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 1 Kings 12:29 And he put one in Bethel, and he put the other in Dan. 1 Kings 12:30 And this thing became a sin; and the people went before one as far as Dan, and left the house of the Lord. 1 Kings 12:31 And he made houses on the high places, and made priests of any part of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi. 1 Kings 12:32 And Jeroboam appointed a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, according to the feast in the land of Juda; 1 Kings 12:33 and went up to the altar which he made in Baethel to sacrifice to the heifers which he made, and he placed in Baethel the priests of the high places which he had made. And he went up to the altar which he had made, on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, at the feast which he devised out of his own heart; and he made a feast to the children of Israel, and went up to the altar to sacrifice. 1 Kings 13:1 ¶ And behold, there came a man of God out of Juda by the word of the Lord to Baethel, and Jeroboam stood at the altar to sacrifice. 1 Kings 13:2 And he cried against the altar by the word of the Lord, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord, Behold, a son is to be born to the house of David, Josias by name; and he shall offer upon thee the priests of the high places, even of them that sacrifice upon thee, and he shall burn men's bones upon thee. 1 Kings 13:3 And in that day one shall give a sign, saying, This is the word which the Lord has spoken, saying, Behold, the altar is rent, and the fatness upon it shall be poured out. 1 Kings 13:4 And it came to pass when king Jeroboam heard the words of the man of God who called on the altar that was in Baethel, that the king stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying, Take hold of him. And, behold, his hand, which he stretched forth against him, withered, and he could not draw it back to himself. 1 Kings 13:5 And the altar was rent, and the fatness was poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God gave by the word of the Lord. 1 Kings 13:6 And king Jeroboam said to the man of God, Intreat the Lord thy God, and let my hand be restored to me. And the man of God intreated the Lord, and he restored the king's hand to him, and it became as before. 1 Kings 13:7 And the king said to the man of God, Enter with me into the house, and dine, and I will give thee a gift. 1 Kings 13:8 And the man of God said to the king, If thou shouldest give me the half of thine house, I would not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread, neither will I drink water in this place; for thus the Lord charged me by his word, saying, 1 Kings 13:9 Eat no bread, and drink no water, and return not by the way by which thou camest. 1 Kings 13:10 So he departed by another way, and returned not by the way by which he came to Baethel. 1 Kings 13:11 ¶ And there dwelt an old prophet in Baethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God did on that day in Baethel, and the words which he spoke to the king: and they turned the face of their father. 1 Kings 13:12 And their father spoke to them, saying, Which way went he? and his sons shew him the way by which the man of God who came out of Juda went up. 1 Kings 13:13 And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass: and they saddled him the ass, and he mounted it, 1 Kings 13:14 and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, Art thou the man of God that came out of Juda? And he said to him, I am. 1 Kings 13:15 And he said to him, Come with me, and eat bread. 1 Kings 13:16 And he said, I shall not by any means be able to return with thee, neither will I eat bread, neither will I drink water in this place. 1 Kings 13:17 For thus the Lord commanded me by word, saying, Eat not bread there, and drink not water, and return not thither by the way by which thou camest. 1 Kings 13:18 And he said to him, I also am a prophet as thou art; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back to thee into thy house, and let him eat bread and drink water: but he lied to him. 1 Kings 13:19 And he brought him back, and he ate bread and drank water in his house. 1 Kings 13:20 And it came to pass while they were sitting at the table, that the word of the Lord came to the prophet that brought him back; 1 Kings 13:21 and he spoke to the man of God that came out of Juda, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast resisted the word of the Lord, and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee, 1 Kings 13:22 but hast returned, and eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he spoke to thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat bread, and shalt not drink water; therefore thy body shall in nowise enter into the sepulchre of thy fathers. 1 Kings 13:23 ¶ And it came to pass after he had eaten bread and drunk water, that he saddled the ass for him, and he turned and departed. 1 Kings 13:24 And a lion found him in the way, and slew him; and his body was cast out in the way, and the ass was standing by it, and the lion also was standing by the body. 1 Kings 13:25 And, behold, men were passing by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion was standing near the carcase: and they went in and spoke of it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. 1 Kings 13:26 And the prophet that turned him back out of the way heard, and said, This is the man of God who rebelled against the word of the Lord. 1 Kings 13:27 1 Kings 13:28 And he went and found the body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion were standing by the body: and the lion had not devoured the body of the man of God, and had not torn the ass. 1 Kings 13:29 And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it on his ass; and the prophet brought him back to his city, to bury him in his own tomb, 1 Kings 13:30 and they bewailed him, saying, Alas, brother. 1 Kings 13:31 And it came to pass after he had lamented him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, Whenever I die, bury me in this tomb wherein the man of God is buried; lay me by his bones, that my bones may be preserved with his bones. 1 Kings 13:32 For the word will surely come to pass which he spoke by the word of the Lord against the altar in Baethel, and against the high houses in Samaria. 1 Kings 13:33 And after this Jeroboam turned not from his sin, but he turned and made of part of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became a priest for the high places. 1 Kings 13:34 And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to its destruction and its removal from the face of the earth. 1 Kings 14:1 ¶ 1 Kings 14:2 1 Kings 14:3 1 Kings 14:4 1 Kings 14:5 1 Kings 14:6 1 Kings 14:7 ¶ 1 Kings 14:8 1 Kings 14:9 1 Kings 14:10 1 Kings 14:11 1 Kings 14:12 1 Kings 14:13 1 Kings 14:14 1 Kings 14:15 1 Kings 14:16 1 Kings 14:17 1 Kings 14:18 1 Kings 14:19 1 Kings 14:20 1 Kings 14:21 ¶ And Roboam son of Solomon ruled over Juda. Roboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in the city Jerusalem, which the Lord chose to put his name there out of all the tribes of Israel: and his mother's name was Naama the Ammonitess. 1 Kings 14:22 And Roboam did evil in the sight of the Lord; and he provoked him in all the things which their fathers did in their sins which they sinned. 1 Kings 14:23 And they built for themselves high places, and pillars, and planted groves on every high hill, and under every shady tree. 1 Kings 14:24 And there was a conspiracy in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord removed from before the children of Israel. 1 Kings 14:25 And it came to pass in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Susakim king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; 1 Kings 14:26 and took all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and the golden spears which David took out of the hand of the sons of Adrazaar king of Suba, and brought them into Jerusalem, even all that he took, and the golden shields which Solomon had made, [[and carried them away into Egypt.]] 1 Kings 14:27 And king Roboam made brazen shields instead of them; and the chiefs of the body guard, who kept the gate of the house of the king, were placed in charge over them. 1 Kings 14:28 And it came to pass when the king went into the house of the Lord, that the body guard took them up, and fixed them in the chamber of the body guard. 1 Kings 14:29 And the rest of the history of Roboam, and all that he did, behold, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 1 Kings 14:30 And there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam continually. 1 Kings 14:31 And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Abiu his son reigned in his stead. 1 Kings 15:1 ¶ And in the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nabat, Abiu son of Roboam reigns over Juda. 1 Kings 15:2 And he reigned three years over Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Maacha, daughter of Abessalom. 1 Kings 15:3 And he walked in the sins of his father which he wrought in his presence, and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of his father David. 1 Kings 15:4 Howbeit for David's sake the Lord gave him a remnant, that he might establish his children after him, and might establish Jerusalem. 1 Kings 15:5 Forasmuch as David did that which was right in the sight of the Lord: he turned not from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life. 1 Kings 15:6 1 Kings 15:7 And the rest of the history of Abiu, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? And there was war between Abiu and Jeroboam. 1 Kings 15:8 And Abiu slept with his fathers in the twenty-fourth year of Jeroboam; and he is buried with his fathers in the city of David: And Asa his son reigns in his stead. 1 Kings 15:9 ¶ In the four and twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa begins to reign over Juda. 1 Kings 15:10 And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Ana, daughter of Abessalom. 1 Kings 15:11 And Asa did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, as David his father. 1 Kings 15:12 And he removed the sodomites out of the land, and abolished all the practices which his fathers had kept up. 1 Kings 15:13 And he removed Ana his mother from being queen, forasmuch as she gathered a meeting in her grove: and Asa cut down her retreats, and burnt them with fire in the brook of Kedron. 1 Kings 15:14 But he removed not the high places; nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with the Lord all his days. 1 Kings 15:15 And he brought in the pillars of his father, he even brought in his gold and silver pillars into the house of the Lord, and his vessels. 1 Kings 15:16 And there was war between Asa and Baasa king of Israel all their days. 1 Kings 15:17 And Baasa king of Israel went up against Juda, and built Rama, so that no one should go out or come in for Asa king of Juda. 1 Kings 15:18 And Asa took all the silver and the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house, and gave them into the hands of his servants; and king Asa sent them out to the son of Ader, the son of Taberema son of Azin king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying, 1 Kings 15:19 Make a covenant between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: lo! I have sent forth to thee gold and silver for gifts: come, break thy league with Baasa king of Israel, that he may go up from me. 1 Kings 15:20 And the son of Ader hearkened to king Asa, and sent the chiefs of his forces to the cities of Israel; and they smote Ain, Dan, and Abel of the house of Maacha, and all Chennereth, as far as the whole land of Nephthali. 1 Kings 15:21 And it came to pass when Baasa heard it, that he left off building Rama, and returned to Thersa. 1 Kings 15:22 And king Asa charged all Juda without exception: and they take up the stones of Rama and its timbers with which Baasa was building; and king Asa built with them upon the whole hill of Benjamin, and the watch-tower. 1 Kings 15:23 And the rest of the history of Asa, and all his mighty deeds which he wrought, and the cities which he built, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 1 Kings 15:24 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Josaphat his son reigns in his stead. 1 Kings 15:25 ¶ And Nabat son of Jeroboam reigns over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Juda, and he reigned two years in Israel. 1 Kings 15:26 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sins wherein he caused Israel to sin. 1 Kings 15:27 And Baasa son of Achia, who was over the house of Belaan son of Achia, conspired against him, and smote him in Gabathon of the Philistines; for Nabat and all Israel were besieging Gabathon. 1 Kings 15:28 And Baasa slew him in the third year of Asa son of Asa king of Juda; and reigned in his stead. 1 Kings 15:29 And it came to pass when he reigned, that he smote the whole house of Jeroboam, and left none that breathed of Jeroboam, until he has destroyed him utterly, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by his servant Achia the Selonite, 1 Kings 15:30 for the sins of Jeroboam, who led Israel into sin, even by his provocation wherewith he provoked the Lord God of Israel. 1 Kings 15:31 And the rest of the history of Nabat, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 1 Kings 15:32 1 Kings 15:33 And in the third year of Asa king of Juda, Baasa the son of Achia begins to reign over Israel in Thersa, twenty and four years. 1 Kings 15:34 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and in his sins, as he caused Israel to sin. 1 Kings 16:1 ¶ And the word of the Lord came by the hand of Ju son of Anani to Baasa, saying, 1 Kings 16:2 Forasmuch as I lifted thee up from the earth, and made thee ruler over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast caused my people Israel to sin, to provoke me with their vanities; 1 Kings 16:3 Behold, I raise up enemies after Baasa, and after his house; and I will make thy house as the house of Jeroboam son of Nabat. 1 Kings 16:4 Him the dies of Baasa in the city the dogs shall devour, and him that dies of his in the field the birds of the sky shall devour. 1 Kings 16:5 Now the rest of the history of Baasa, and all that he did, and his mighty acts, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 1 Kings 16:6 And Baasa slept with his fathers, and they bury him in Thersa; and Ela his son reigns in his stead. 1 Kings 16:7 And the Lord spoke by Ju the son of Anani against Baasa, and against his house, even all the evil which he wrought before the Lord to provoke him to anger by the works of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he smote him. 1 Kings 16:8 And Ela son of Baasa reigned over Israel two years in Thersa. 1 Kings 16:9 And Zambri, captain of half his cavalry, conspired against him, while he was in Thersa, drinking himself drunk in the house of Osa the steward at Thersa. 1 Kings 16:10 And Zambri went in and smote him and slew him, and reigned in his stead. 1 Kings 16:11 And it came to pass when he reigned, when he sat upon his throne, 1 Kings 16:12 that he smote all the house of Baasa, according to the word which the Lord spoke against the house of Baasa, and to Ju the prophet, 1 Kings 16:13 for all the sins of Baasa and Ela his son, as he led Israel astray to sin, to provoke the Lord God of Israel with their vanities. 1 Kings 16:14 And the rest of the deeds of Ela which he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 1 Kings 16:15 ¶ And Zambri reigned in Thersa seven days: and the army of Israel was encamped against Gabathon of the Philistines. 1 Kings 16:16 And the people heard in the army, saying, Zambri has conspired and smitten the king: and the people of Israel made Ambri the captain of the host king in that day in the camp over Israel. 1 Kings 16:17 And Ambri went up, and all Israel with him, out of Gabathon; and they besieged Thersa. 1 Kings 16:18 And it came to pass when Zambri saw that his city was taken, that he goes into the inner chamber of the house of the king, and burnt the king's house over him, and died. 1 Kings 16:19 Because of his sins which he committed, doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, so as to walk in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and in his sins wherein he caused Israel to sin. 1 Kings 16:20 And the rest of the history of Zambri, and his conspiracies wherein he conspired, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 1 Kings 16:21 Then the people of Israel divides; half the people goes after Thamni the son of Gonath to make him king; and half the people goes after Ambri. 1 Kings 16:22 The people that followed Ambri overpowered the people that followed Thamni son of Gonath; and Thamni died and Joram his brother at that time, and Ambri reigned after Thamni. 1 Kings 16:23 In the thirty-first year of king Asa, Ambri begins to reign over Israel twelve years: he reigns six years in Thersa. 1 Kings 16:24 And Ambri bought the mount Semeron of Semer the lord of the mountain for two talents of silver; and he built upon the mountain, and they called the name of the mountain on which he built, after the name of Semer the lord of the mount, Semeron. 1 Kings 16:25 And Ambri did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and wrought wickedly beyond all that were before him. 1 Kings 16:26 And he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and in his sins wherewith he caused Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord God of Israel by their vanities. 1 Kings 16:27 And the rest of the acts of Ambri, and all that he did, and all his might, behold, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 1 Kings 16:28 And Ambri slept with his fathers, and is buried in Samaria; and Achaab his son reigns in his stead."

And he took him out of her bosom, and took him up to the chamber in which he himself lodged, and laid him on the bed. 1 Kings 17:20 And Eliu cried aloud, and said, Alas, O Lord, the witness of the widow with whom I sojourn, thou hast wrought evil for her in slaying her son. 1 Kings 17:21 And he breathed on the child thrice, and called on the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, let, I pray thee, the soul of this child return to him. 1 Kings 17:22 And it was so, and the child cried out, 1 Kings 17:23 and he brought him down from the upper chamber into the house, and gave him to his mother; and Eliu said, See, thy son lives. 1 Kings 17:24 And the woman said to Eliu, Behold, I know that thou art a man of God, and the word of the Lord in thy mouth is true. 1 Kings 18:1 ¶ And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came to Eliu in the third year, saying, Go, and appear before Achaab, and I will bring rain upon the face of the earth. 1 Kings 18:2 And Eliu went to appear before Achaab: and the famine was severe in Samaria. 1 Kings 18:3 And Achaab called Abdiu the steward. Now Abdiu feared the Lord greatly. 1 Kings 18:4 And it came to pass when Jezabel smote the prophets of the Lord, that Abdiu took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water. 1 Kings 18:5 And Achaab said to Abdiu, Come, and let us go through the land, and to the fountains of water, and to the brooks, if by any means we may find grass, and may save the horses and mules, and so they will not perish from the tents. 1 Kings 18:6 And they made a division of the way between them to pass through it: Achaab went one way, and Abdiu went by another way alone. 1 Kings 18:7 And Abdiu was alone in the way; and Eliu came alone to meet him: and Abdiu hasted, and fell upon his face, and said, My lord Eliu, art thou indeed he? 1 Kings 18:8 And Eliu said to him, I am: go say to thy master, Behold, Eliu is here. 1 Kings 18:9 And Abdiu said, What sin have I committed, that thou givest thy servant into the hand of Achaab to slay me? 1 Kings 18:10 As the Lord thy God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom, whither my lord has not sent to seek thee; and if they said, He is not here, then has he set fire to the kingdom and its territories, because he has not found thee. 1 Kings 18:11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Eliu is here. 1 Kings 18:12 And it shall come to pass when I shall have departed from thee, that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee to a land which I know not, and I shall go in to tell the matter to Achaab, and he will not find thee and will slay me: yet thy servant fears the Lord from his youth. 1 Kings 18:13 Has it not been told to thee my lord, what I did when Jezabel slew the prophets of the Lord, that I hid a hundred men of the prophets of the Lord, by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? 1 Kings 18:14 And now thou sayest to me, Go, say to thy master, Behold, Eliu is here: and he shall slay me. 1 Kings 18:15 And Eliu said, As the Lord of Hosts before whom I stand lives, to-day I will appear before him. 1 Kings 18:16 And Abdiu went to meet Achaab, and told him: and Achaab hasted forth, and went to meet Eliu. 1 Kings 18:17 ¶ And it came to pass when Achaab saw Eliu, that Achaab said to Eliu, Art thou he that perverts Israel? 1 Kings 18:18 And Eliu said, I do not pervert Israel; but it is thou and thy father's house, in that ye forsake the Lord your God, and thou hast gone after Baalim. 1 Kings 18:19 And now send, gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of shame four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, that eat at Jezabel's table. 1 Kings 18:20 And Achaab sent to all Israel, and gathered all the prophets to mount Carmel. 1 Kings 18:21 ¶ And Eliu drew near to them all: and Eliu said to them, How long wilt ye halt on both feet? if the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, follow him. And the people answered not a word. 1 Kings 18:22 And Eliu said to the people, I am left, the only one prophet of the Lord; and the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men, and the prophets of the groves four hundred. 1 Kings 18:23 Let them give us two oxen, and let them choose one for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire on the wood: and I will dress the other bullock, and put on no fire. 1 Kings 18:24 And do ye call loudly on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord my God, and it shall come to pass that the God who shall answer by fire, he is God. And all the people answered and said, The word which thou hast spoken is good. 1 Kings 18:25 And Eliu said to the prophets of shame, Choose to yourselves one calf, and dress it first, for ye are many; and call ye on the name of your god; but apply no fire. 1 Kings 18:26 And they took the calf and drest it, and called on the name of Baal from morning till noon, and said, hear us, O Baal, hear us. And there was no voice, neither was there hearing, and they ran up and down on the alter which they had made. 1 Kings 18:27 And it was noon, and Eliu the Thesbite mocked them, and said, Call with a loud voice, for he is a god; for he is meditating, or else perhaps he is engaged in business, or perhaps he is asleep, and is to be awaked. 1 Kings 18:28 And they cried with a loud voice, and cut themselves according to their custom with knives and lancets until the blood gushed out upon them. 1 Kings 18:29 And they prophesied until the evening came; and it came to pass as it was the time of the offering of the sacrifice, that Eliu the Thesbite spoke to the prophets of the abominations, saying, Stand by for the present, and I will offer my sacrifice. And they stood aside and departed. 1 Kings 18:30 And Eliu said to the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. 1 Kings 18:31 And Eliu took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, as the Lord spoke to him, saying, Israel shall be thy name. 1 Kings 18:32 And he built up the stones in the name of the Lord, and repaired the altar that had been broken down; and he made a trench that would hold two measures of seed round about the altar. 1 Kings 18:33 And he piled the cleft wood on the altar which he had made, and divided the whole-burnt-offering, and laid it on the wood, and laid it in order on the altar, and said, Fetch me four pitchers of water, and pour it on the whole-burnt-offering, and on the wood. And they did so. 1 Kings 18:34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time. 1 Kings 18:35 And the water ran round about the altar, and they filled the trench with water. 1 Kings 18:36 And Eliu cried aloud to the heaven, and said, Lord God of Abraam, and Isaac, and Israel, answer me, O Lord, answer me this day by fire, and let all this people know that thou art the Lord, the God of Israel, and I am thy servant, and for thy sake I have wrought these works. 1 Kings 18:37 Hear me, O Lord, hear me, and let this people know that thou art the Lord God, and thou hast turned back the heart of this people. 1 Kings 18:38 Then fire fell from the Lord out of heaven, and devoured the whole-burnt-offerings, and the wood and the water that was in the trench, and the fire licked up the stones and the earth. 1 Kings 18:39 And all the people fell upon their faces, and said, Truly the Lord is God; he is God. 1 Kings 18:40 And Eliu said to the people, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them; and Eliu brings them down to the brook Kisson, and he slew them there. 1 Kings 18:41 ¶ And Eliu said to Achaab, Go up, and eat and drink, for there is a sound of the coming of rain. 1 Kings 18:42 And Achaab went up to eat and to drink; and Eliu went up to Carmel, and stooped to the ground, and put his face between his knees, 1 Kings 18:43 and said to his servant, Go up, and look toward the sea. And the servant looked, and said, There is nothing: and Eliu said, Do thou then go again seven times. 1 Kings 18:44 And the servant went again seven times: and it came to pass at the seventh time, that, behold, a little cloud like the sole of a man's foot brought water; and he said, Go up, and say to Achaab, make ready thy chariot, and go down, lest the rain overtake thee. 1 Kings 18:45 And it came to pass in the meanwhile, that the heaven grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Achaab wept, and went to Jezrael. 1 Kings 18:46 And the hand of the Lord was upon Eliu, and he girt up his loins, and ran before Achaab to Jezrael. 1 Kings 19:1 ¶ And Achaab told Jezabel his wife all that Eliu had done, and how he had slain the prophets with the sword. 1 Kings 19:2 And Jezabel sent to Eliu, and said, If thou art Eliu and I am Jezabel, God do so to me, and more also, if I do not make thy life by this time to-morrow as the life of one of them. 1 Kings 19:3 And Eliu feared, and rose, and departed for his life: and he comes to Bersabee to the land of Juda, and he left his servant there. 1 Kings 19:4 And he himself went a day's journey in the wilderness, and came and sat under a juniper tree; and asked concerning his life that he might die, and said, Let it be enough now, O Lord, take, I pray thee, my life from me; for I am no better than my fathers. 1 Kings 19:5 And he lay down and slept there under a tree; and behold, some one touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat. 1 Kings 19:6 And Eliu looked, and, behold, at his head there was a cake of meal and a cruse of water; and he arose, and ate and drank, and returned and lay down. 1 Kings 19:7 And the angel of the Lord returned again, and touched him, and said to him, Arise, and eat, for the journey is far from thee. 1 Kings 19:8 And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights to mount Choreb. 1 Kings 19:9 ¶ And he entered there into a cave, and rested there; and, behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he said, What doest thou here, Eliu? 1 Kings 19:10 And Eliu said, I have been very jealous for the Lord Almighty, because the children of Israel have forsaken thee: they have digged down thine altars, and have slain thy prophets with the sword; and I only am left alone, and they seek my life to take it. 1 Kings 19:11 And he said, Thou shalt go forth to-morrow, and shalt stand before the Lord in the mount; behold, the Lord will pass by. And, behold, a great and strong wind rending the mountains, and crushing the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: 1 Kings 19:12 and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire the voice of a gentle breeze. 1 Kings 19:13 And it came to pass when Eliu heard, that he wrapt his face in his mantle, and went forth and stood in the cave: and, behold, a voice came to him and said, What doest thou here, Eliu? 1 Kings 19:14 And Eliu said, I have been very jealous for the Lord Almighty; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, and they have overthrown thine altars, and have slain thy prophets with the sword! and I am left entirely alone, and they seek my life to take it. 1 Kings 19:15 And the Lord said to him, Go, return, and thou shalt come into the way of the wilderness of Damascus: and thou shalt go and anoint Azael to be king over Syria. 1 Kings 19:16 And Ju the son of Namessi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisaie the son of Saphat shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. 1 Kings 19:17 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapes from the sword of Azael, Ju shall slay; and him that escapes from the sword of Ju, Elisaie shall slay. 1 Kings 19:18 And thou shalt leave in Israel seven thousand men, all the knees which had not bowed themselves to Baal, and every mouth which had not worshipped him. 1 Kings 19:19 ¶ And he departed thence, and finds Elisaie the son of Saphat, and he was ploughing with oxen; there were twelve yoke before him, and he with the twelve, and he passed by to him, and cast his mantle upon him. 1 Kings 19:20 And Elisaie left the cattle, and ran after Eliu and said, I will kiss my father, and follow after thee. And Eliu said, Return, for I have done a work for thee. 1 Kings 19:21 And he returned from following him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled them with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate: and he arose, and went after Eliu, and ministered to him. 1 Kings 20:1 ¶ (21:1) And the son of Ader gathered all his forces, and went up and besieged Samaria, he and thirty-two kings with him, and all his horse and chariots: and they went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it. 1 Kings 20:2 (21:2) And he sent into the city to Achaab king of Israel, and said to him, Thus says the son of Ader, 1 Kings 20:3 (21:3) Thy silver and thy gold are mine, and thy wives and thy children are mine. 1 Kings 20:4 (21:4) And the king of Israel answered and said, As thou hast said, my lord, O king, I am thine, and all mine also. 1 Kings 20:5 (21:5) And the messengers came again, and said, Thus says the son of Ader, I sent to thee, saying, Thou shalt give me thy silver and thy gold, and thy wives and thy children. 1 Kings 20:6 (21:6) For at this time to-morrow I will send my servants to thee, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants, and it shall be that all the desirable objects of their eyes on which they shall lay their hands, they shall even take them. 1 Kings 20:7 (21:7) And the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Take notice now and consider, that this man seeks mischief: for he has sent to me concerning my wives, and concerning my sons, an concerning my daughters: I have not kept back from him my silver and my gold. 1 Kings 20:8 (21:8) And the elders and all the people said to him, Hearken not, and consent not. 1 Kings 20:9 (21:9) And he said to the messengers of the son of Ader, Say to your master, All things that thou hast sent to thy servant about at first I will do; but this thing I shall not be able to do. And the men departed, and carried back the answer to him. 1 Kings 20:10 (21:10) And the son of Ader sent to him, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for foxes to all the people, even my infantry. 1 Kings 20:11 (21:11) And the king of Israel answered and said, Let it be sufficient; let not the humpbacked boast as he that is upright. 1 Kings 20:12 ¶ (21:12) And it came to pass when he returned him this answer, he and all the kings with him were drinking in tents: and he said to his servants, Form a trench. And they made a trench against the city. 1 Kings 20:13 (21:13) And, behold, a prophet came to Achaab king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou seen this great multitude? behold, I give it this day into thine hands; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. 1 Kings 20:14 (21:14) And Achaab said, Whereby? And he said, Thus saith the Lord, by the young men of the heads of the districts. And Achaab said, Who shall begin the battle? and he said, Thou. 1 Kings 20:15 (21:15) And Achaab numbered the young men the heads of the districts, and they were two hundred and thirty: and afterwards he numbered the people, even every man fit for war, seven thousand. 1 Kings 20:16 (21:16) And he went forth at noon, an the son of Ader was drinking and getting drunk in Socchoth, he and the kings, even thirty and two kings, his allies. 1 Kings 20:17 (21:17) And the young men the heads of the districts went forth first; and they send and report to the king of Syria, saying, There are men come forth out of Samaria. 1 Kings 20:18 (21:18) And he said to them, If they come forth peaceably, take them alive; and if they come forth to war, take them alive: 1 Kings 20:19 (21:19) and let not the young men the heads of the districts go forth of the city. And the force that was behind them 1 Kings 20:20 (21:20) smote each one the man next to him; and each one a second time smote the man next to him: and Syria fled, and Israel pursued them; and the son of Ader, even the king of Syria, escapes on the horse of a horseman. 1 Kings 20:21 (21:21) And the king of Israel went forth, and took all the horses and the chariots, and smote the enemy with a great slaughter in Syria. 1 Kings 20:22 ¶ (21:22) And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said, Strengthen thyself, and observe, and see what thou shalt do; for at the return of the year the son of Ader king of Syria comes up against thee. 1 Kings 20:23 (21:23) And the servants of the king of Syria, even they said, The God of Israel is a God of mountains, and not a God of valleys; therefore has he prevailed against us: but if we should fight against them in the plain, verily we shall prevail against them. 1 Kings 20:24 (21:24) And do thou this thing: Send away the kings, each one to his place, and set princes in their stead. 1 Kings 20:25 (21:25) And we will give thee another army according to the army that was destroyed, and cavalry according to the cavalry, and chariots according to the chariots, and we will fight against them in the plain, and we shall prevail against them. And he hearkened to their voice, and did so. 1 Kings 20:26 (21:26) And it came to pass at the return of the year, that the son of Ader reviewed Syria, and went up to Apheca to war against Israel. 1 Kings 20:27 (21:27) And the children of Israel were numbered, and came to meet them: and Israel encamped before them as two little flocks of goats, but Syria filled the land. 1 Kings 20:28 (21:28) And there came the man of God, and said to the king of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, Because Syria has said, The Lord God of Israel is a God of the hills, and he is not a God of the valleys, therefore will I give this great army into thy hand, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. 1 Kings 20:29 (21:29) And they encamp one over against the other before them seven days. And it came to pass on the seventh day that the battle drew on, and Israel smote Syria, even a hundred thousand footmen in one day. 1 Kings 20:30 (21:30) And the rest fled to Apheca, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand men that were left: and the son of Ader fled, and entered into an inner chamber, into a closet. 1 Kings 20:31 ¶ (21:31) And he said to his servants, I know that the kings of Israel are merciful kings: let us now put sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and let us go forth to the king of Israel, if by any means he will save our souls alive. 1 Kings 20:32 (21:32) So they girt sackcloth upon their loins, and put ropes upon their heads, and said to the king of Israel, Thy servant the son of Ader says, Let our souls live, I pray thee. And he said, Does he yet live? He is my brother. 1 Kings 20:33 (21:33) And the men divined, and offered drink-offerings; and they caught the word out of his mouth, and said, Thy brother the son of Ader. And he said, Go ye in and fetch him. And the son of Ader went out to him, and they cause him to go up to him into the chariot. 1 Kings 20:34 (21:34) And he said to him, The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore to thee; and thou shalt make streets for thyself in Damascus, as my father made streets in Samaria; and I will let thee go with a covenant. And he made a covenant with him, and let him go. 1 Kings 20:35 (21:35) And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbour by the word of the Lord, Smite me, I pray, And the man would not smite him. 1 Kings 20:36 (21:36) And he said to him, Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, therefore, behold, as thou departest from me, a lion shall smite thee: and he departed from him, and a lion found him, and smote him. 1 Kings 20:37 (21:37) And he finds another man, and says, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, and in smiting wounded him. 1 Kings 20:38 (21:38) And the prophet went and stood before the king of Israel by the way, and bound his eyes with a bandage. 1 Kings 20:39 (21:39) And it came to pass as the king passed by, that he cried aloud to the king, and said, Thy servant went out to war, and, behold, a man brought another man to me, and said to me, Keep his man; and if he should by any means escape, then thy life shall go for his life, or thou shalt pay a talent of silver. 1 Kings 20:40 (21:40) And it came to pass, that thy servant looked round this way and that way, and the man was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, Behold, thou hast also destroyed snares set for me. 1 Kings 20:41 (21:41) And he hasted, and took away the bandage from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was one of the prophets. 1 Kings 20:42 (21:42) And he said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast suffered to escape out of thine hand a man appointed to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people. 1 Kings 20:43 (21:43) And the king of Israel departed confounded and discouraged, and came to Samaria. 1 Kings 21:1 ¶ (20:1) And Nabuthai the Jezraelite had a vineyard, near the threshingfloor of Achaab king of Samaria. 1 Kings 21:2 (20:2) And Achaab spoke to Nabuthai, saying, Give me thy vineyard, and I will have it for a garden of herbs, for it is near my house: and I will give thee another vineyard better than it; or if it please thee, I will give thee money, the price of this thy vineyard, and I will have it for a garden of herbs. 1 Kings 21:3 (20:3) And Nabuthai said to Achaab, My God forbid me that I should give thee the inheritance of my fathers. 1 Kings 21:4 (20:4) And the spirit of Achaab was troubled, and he lay down upon his bed, and covered his face, and ate no bread. 1 Kings 21:5 ¶ (20:5) And Jezabel his wife went in to him, and spoke to him, saying, Why is thy spirit troubled, and why dost thou eat no bread? 1 Kings 21:6 (20:6) And he said to her, Because I spoke to Nabuthai the Jezraelite, saying, Give me thy vineyard for money; or if thou wilt, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. 1 Kings 21:7 (20:7) And Jezabel his wife said to him, Dost thou now thus act the king over Israel? arise, and eat bread, and be thine own master, and I will give thee the vineyard of Nabuthai the Jezraelite. 1 Kings 21:8 (20:8) And she wrote a letter in the name of Achaab, and sealed it with his seal, and sent the letter to the elders, and to the freemen who dwelt with Nabuthai. 1 Kings 21:9 (20:9) And it was written in the letters, saying, Keep a fast, and set Naboth in a chief place among the people. 1 Kings 21:10 (20:10) And set two men, sons of transgressors, before him, and let them testify against him, saying, He blessed God and the king: and let them lead him forth, and stone him, and let them die. 1 Kings 21:11 (20:11) And the men of his city, the elders, and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezabel sent to them, and as it had been written in the letters which she sent to them. 1 Kings 21:12 (20:12) And they proclaimed a fast, and set Nebuthai in a chief place among the people. 1 Kings 21:13 (20:13) And two men, sons of transgressors, came in, and sat opposite him, and bore witness against him, saying, Thou hast blessed God and the king. And they led him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, and he died. 1 Kings 21:14 (20:14) And they sent to Jezabel, saying, Nabuthai is stoned, and is dead. 1 Kings 21:15 (20:15) And it came to pass, when Jezabel heard it, that she said to Achaab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Nabuthai the Jezraelite, who would not sell it to thee: for Nebuthai is not alive, for he is dead. 1 Kings 21:16 (20:16) And it came to pass, when Achaab heard that Nabuthai the Jezraelite was dead, that he rent his garments, and put on sackcloth. And it came to pass afterward, that Achaab arose and went down to the vineyard of Nabuthai the Jezraelite, to take possession of it. 1 Kings 21:17 ¶ (20:17) And the Lord spoke to Eliu the Thesbite, saying, 1 Kings 21:18 (20:18) Arise, and go down to meet Achaab king of Israel, who is in Samaria, for he is in the vineyard of Nabuthai, for he has gone down thither to take possession of it. 1 Kings 21:19 (20:19) And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast slain and taken possession, therefore thus saith the Lord, In every place where the swine and the dogs have licked the blood of Nabuthai, there shall the dogs lick thy blood; and the harlots shall wash themselves in thy blood. 1 Kings 21:20 (20:20) And Achaab said to Eliu, Hast thou found me, mine enemy? and he said, I have found thee: because thou hast wickedly sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger; 1 Kings 21:21 (20:21) behold, I bring evil upon thee: and I will kindle a fire after thee, and I will utterly destroy every male of Achaab, and him that is shut up and him that is left in Israel. 1 Kings 21:22 (20:22) And I will make thy house as the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa son of Achia, because of the provocations wherewith thou hast provoked me, and caused Israel to sin. 1 Kings 21:23 (20:23) And the Lord spoke of Jezabel, saying, The dogs shall devour her within the fortification of Jezrael. 1 Kings 21:24 (20:24) Him that is dead of Achaab in the city shall the dogs eat, and him that is dead of him in the field shall the birds of the sky eat. 1 Kings 21:25 (20:25) But Achaab did wickedly, in that he sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his wife Jezabel led him astray. 1 Kings 21:26 (20:26) And he did very abominably in following after the abominations, according to all that the Amorite did, whom the Lord utterly destroyed from before the children of Israel. 1 Kings 21:27 (20:27) And because of the word, Achaab was pierced with sorrow before the Lord, and he both went weeping, and rent his garment, and girt sackcloth upon his body, and fasted; he put on sackcloth also in the day that he smote Nabuthai the Jezraelite, and went his way. 1 Kings 21:28 (20:28) And the word of the Lord came by the hand of his servant Eliu concerning Achaab, and the Lord said, 1 Kings 21:29 (20:29) Hast thou seen how Achaab has been pricked to the heart before me? I will not bring on the evil in his days, but in his son's days will I bring on the evil. 1 Kings 22:1 ¶ And he rested three years, and there was no war between Syria and Israel. 1 Kings 22:2 And it came to pass in the third year, that Josaphat king of Juda went down to the king of Israel. 1 Kings 22:3 And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know ye that Remmath Galaad is ours, and we are slow to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria? 1 Kings 22:4 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Wilt thou go up with us to Remmath Galaad to battle? 1 Kings 22:5 And Josaphat said, As I am, so art thou also; as my people, so is thy people; as my horses, so are thy horses. And Josaphat king of Juda said to the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, of the Lord to- day. 1 Kings 22:6 And the king of Israel gathered all the prophets together, about four hundred men; and the king said to them, Shall I go up to Remmath Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? and they said, Go up, and the Lord will surely give it into the hands of the king. 1 Kings 22:7 And Josaphat said to the king of Israel, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may enquire of the Lord by him? 1 Kings 22:8 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, There is one man here for us to enquire of the Lord by; but I hate him, for he does not speak good of me, but only evil; Michaias son of Jemblaa. And Josaphat king of Juda said, Let not the king say so. 1 Kings 22:9 And the king of Israel called a eunuch and said, Bring hither quickly Michaias son of Jemblaa. 1 Kings 22:10 And the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda sat, each on his throne, armed in the gates of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. 1 Kings 22:11 And Sedekias son of Chanaan made for himself iron horns, and said, Thus saith the Lord, With these thou shalt push Syria, until it be consumed. 1 Kings 22:12 And all the prophets prophesied in like manner, saying, Go up to Remmath Galaad, and the thing shall prosper, and the Lord shall deliver it and the king of Syria into thine hands. 1 Kings 22:13 And the messenger that went to call Michaias spoke to him, saying, Behold now, all the prophets speak with one mouth good concerning the king, let now thy words be like the words of one of them, and speak good things. 1 Kings 22:14 And Michaias said, As the Lord lives, whatsoever the Lord shall say to me, that will I speak. 1 Kings 22:15 ¶ And he came to the king: and the king said to him, Michaias, shall I go up to Remmath Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? and he said, Go up, and the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. 1 Kings 22:16 And the king said to him, How often shall I adjure thee, that thou speak to me truth in the name of the Lord? 1 Kings 22:17 And he said, Not so. I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains as a flock without a shepherd: and the Lord said, Is not God lord of these? let each one return to his home in peace. 1 Kings 22:18 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, Did I not say to thee that this man does not prophesy good to me, for he speaks nothing but evil? 1 Kings 22:19 And Michaias said, Not so, it is not I: hear the word of the Lord; it is not so. I saw the God of Israel sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven stood about him on his right hand and on his left. 1 Kings 22:20 And the Lord said, Who will deceive Achaab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall in Remmath Galaad? and one spoke one way, and another another way. 1 Kings 22:21 And there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord, and said, I will deceive him. 1 Kings 22:22 And the Lord said to him, Whereby? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a false spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt deceive him, yea, and shalt prevail: go forth, and do so. 1 Kings 22:23 And now, behold, the Lord has put a false spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil against thee. 1 Kings 22:24 And Sedekias the son of Chanaan came near and smote Michaias on the cheek, and said, What sort of a spirit of the Lord has spoken in thee? 1 Kings 22:25 And Michaias said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an innermost chamber to hide thyself there. 1 Kings 22:26 And the king of Israel said, Take Michaias, and convey him away to Semer the keeper of the city; 1 Kings 22:27 and tell Joas the king's son to put this fellow in prison, and to feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction until I return in peace. 1 Kings 22:28 And Michaias said, If thou return at all in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me. 1 Kings 22:29 ¶ So the king of Israel went up, and Josaphat king of Juda with him to Remmath Galaad. 1 Kings 22:30 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle, and do thou put on my raiment. So the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. 1 Kings 22:31 And the king of Syria had charged the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight not against small or great, but against the king of Israel only. 1 Kings 22:32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat king of Juda, that they said, this seems to be the king of Israel. And they compassed him about to fight against him; and Josaphat cried out. 1 Kings 22:33 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that this was not the king of Israel, that they returned from him. 1 Kings 22:34 And one drew a bow with a good aim, and smote the king of Israel between the lungs and the breast-plate: and he said to his charioteer, Turn thine hands, and carry me away out of the battle, for I am wounded. 1 Kings 22:35 And the war was turned in that day, and the king was standing on the chariot, against Syria from morning till evening; and he shed the blood out of his wound, into the bottom of the chariot, and died at even, and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot. 1 Kings 22:36 And the herald of the army stood at sunset, saying, Let every man go to his own city and his own land, 1 Kings 22:37 for the king is dead. And they came to Samaria, and buried the king in Samaria. 1 Kings 22:38 And they washed the chariot at the fountain of Samaria; and the swine and the dogs licked up the blood, and the harlots washed themselves in the blood, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke. 1 Kings 22:39 And the rest of the acts of Achaab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities which he built, behold, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 1 Kings 22:40 And Achaab slept with his fathers, and Ochozias his son reigned in his stead. 1 Kings 22:41 ¶ And Josaphat the son of Asa reigned over Juda: in the fourth year of Achaab king of Israel began Josaphat to reign. 1 Kings 22:42 Thirty and five years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Azuba daughter of Salai. 1 Kings 22:43 And he walked in all the way of Asa his father: he turned not from it, even from doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord. (22:44) Only he took not away any of the high places: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places. 1 Kings 22:44 (22:45) And Josaphat was at peace with the king of Israel. 1 Kings 22:45 (22:46) And the rest of the acts of Josaphat, and his mighty deeds, whatever he did, behold, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 1 Kings 22:46 1 Kings 22:47 1 Kings 22:48 1 Kings 22:49 1 Kings 22:50 (22:51) And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried by his fathers in the city of David his father, and Joram his son reigned in his stead. 1 Kings 22:51 (22:52) And Ochozias son of Achaab reigned over Israel in Samaria: in the seventeenth year of Josaphat king of Juda, Ochozias son of Achaab reigned over Israel in Samaria two years. 1 Kings 22:52 (22:53) And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of Achaab his father, and in the way of Jezabel his mother, and in the sins of the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who caused Israel to sin. 1 Kings 22:53 (22:54) And he served Baalim, and worshipped them, and provoked the Lord God of Israel, according to all that had been done before him. 2 Kings 1:1 ¶ And Moab repelled against Israel after the death of Achaab. 2 Kings 1:2 Ochozias fell through the lattice that was in his upper chamber in Samaria and was sick; and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go and enquire of Baal fly, the god of Accaron, whether I shall recover of this my sickness. And they went to enquire of him. 2 Kings 1:3 And an angel of the Lord called Eliu the Thesbite, saying, Arise, and go to meet the messengers of Ochozias king of Samaria, and thou shalt say to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baal fly, the God of Accaron? but it shall not be so. 2 Kings 1:4 For thus saith the Lord, The bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down from it, for thou shalt surely die. And Eliu went, and said so to them. 2 Kings 1:5 And the messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why have ye returned? 2 Kings 1:6 And they said to him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus saith the Lord, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou goest to enquire of Baal fly, the God of Accaron? it shall not be so: the bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down from it, for thou shalt surely die. 2 Kings 1:7 So they returned and reported to the king as Eliu said: and he said to them, What was the manner of the man who went up to mid you, and spoke to you these words? 2 Kings 1:8 And they said to him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a leathern girdle about his loins. And he said, This is Eliu the Thesbite. 2 Kings 1:9 ¶ And he sent to him a captain of fifty and his fifty; and he went up to him: and, behold, Eliu sat on the top of a mountain. And the captain of fifty spoke to him, and said, O man of God, the king has called thee, come down. 2 Kings 1:10 And Eliu answered and said to the captain of fifty, And if I am a man of God, fire shall come down out of heaven, and devour thee and thy fifty. And fire came down out of heaven, and devoured him and his fifty. 2 Kings 1:11 And the king sent a second time to him another captain of fifty, and his fifty. And the captain of fifty spoke to him, and said, O man of God, thus says the king, Come down quickly. 2 Kings 1:12 And Eliu answered and spoke to him, and said, If I am a man of God, fire shall come down out of heaven, and devour thee and thy fifty. And fire came down out of heaven, and devoured him and his fifty. 2 Kings 1:13 And the king sent yet again a captain and his fifty. And the third captain of fifty came, and knelt on his knees before Eliu, and entreated him, and spoke to him and said, O man of God, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thine eyes. 2 Kings 1:14 Behold, fire came down from heaven, and devoured the two first captains of fifty: and now, I pray, let my life be precious in thine eyes. 2 Kings 1:15 And the angel of the Lord spoke to Eliu, and said, Go down with him, be not afraid of them. And Eliu rose up, and went down with him to the king. 2 Kings 1:16 And Eliu spoke to him, and said, Thus saith the Lord, Why hast thou sent messengers to enquire of Baal fly, the god of Accaron? it shall not be so: the bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down from it, for thou shalt surely die. 2 Kings 1:17 So he died according to the word of the Lord which Eliu has spoken. 2 Kings 1:18 And the rest of the acts of Ochozias which he did, behold, are they not written in the book of the"

And Elisaie said, As the Lord lives and thy soul lives, I will not leave thee; so they came to Baethel. 2 Kings 2:3 And the sons of the prophets who were in Baethel came to Elisaie, and said to him, Dost thou know, that the Lord this day is going to take thy lord away from thy head? And he said, Yea, I know it; be silent. 2 Kings 2:4 And Eliu said to Elisaie, Stay here, I pray thee; for the Lord has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the Lord lives and thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. And they came to Jericho. 2 Kings 2:5 And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho drew near to Elisaie, and said to him, Dost thou know that the Lord is about to take away thy master to-day from thy head? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold your peace. 2 Kings 2:6 And Eliu said to him, Stay here, I pray thee, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. And Elisaie said, As the Lord lives and thy soul lives, I will not leave thee: and they both went on. 2 Kings 2:7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went also, and they stood opposite afar off: and both stood on the bank of Jordan. 2 Kings 2:8 And Eliu took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the water: and the water was divided on this side and on that side, and they both went over on dry ground. 2 Kings 2:9 ¶ And it came to pass while they were crossing over, that Eliu said to Elisaie, Ask what I shall do for thee before I am taken up from thee. And Elisaie said, Let there be, I pray thee, a double portion of thy spirit upon me. 2 Kings 2:10 And Eliu said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou shalt see me when I am taken up from thee, then shall it be so to thee; and if not, it shall not be so. 2 Kings 2:11 And it came to pass as they were going, they went on talking; and, behold, a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and it separated between them both; and Eliu was taken up in a whirlwind as it were into heaven. 2 Kings 2:12 And Elisaie saw, and cried, Father, father, the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his garments, and rent them into two pieces. 2 Kings 2:13 ¶ And Elisaie took up the mantle of Eliu, which fell from off him upon Elisaie; and Elisaie returned, and stood upon the brink of Jordan; 2 Kings 2:14 and he took the mantle of Eliu, which fell from off him, and smote the water, and said, Where is the Lord God of Eliu? and he smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither; and Elisaie went over. 2 Kings 2:15 And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho on the opposite side saw him, and said, The spirit of Eliu has rested upon Elisaie. And they came to meet him, and did obeisance to him to the ground. 2 Kings 2:16 And they said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty men of strength: let them go now, and seek thy lord: peradventure the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up, and cast him into Jordan, or on one of the mountains, or on one of the hills. And Elisaie said, Ye shall not send. 2 Kings 2:17 And they pressed him until he was ashamed; and he said, Send. And they sent fifty men, and sought three days, and found him not. 2 Kings 2:18 And they returned to him, for he dwelt in Jericho: and Elisaie said, Did I not say to you, Go not? 2 Kings 2:19 ¶ And the men of the city said to Elisaie, Behold, the situation of the city is good, as our lord sees; but the waters are bad, and the ground barren. 2 Kings 2:20 And Elisaie said, Bring me a new pitcher, and put salt in it. And they took one, and brought it to him. 2 Kings 2:21 And Elisaie went out to the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and says, Thus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters; there shall not be any longer death thence or barren land. 2 Kings 2:22 And the waters were healed until this day, according to the word of Elisaie which he spoke. 2 Kings 2:23 And he went up thence to Baethel: and as he was going up by the way there came up also little children from the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, bald-head, go up. 2 Kings 2:24 And he turned after them, and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And, behold, there came out two bears out of the wood, and they tore forty and two children of them. 2 Kings 2:25 And he went thence to mount Carmel, and returned thence to Samaria. 2 Kings 3:1 ¶ And Joram the son of Achaab began to reign in Israel in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda, and he reigned twelve years. 2 Kings 3:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, only not as his father, nor as his mother: and he removed the pillars of Baal which his father had made. 2 Kings 3:3 Only he adhered to the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not from it. 2 Kings 3:4 And Mosa king of Moab was a sheep-master, and he rendered to the king of Israel in the beginning of the year, a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool. 2 Kings 3:5 And it came to pass, after the death of Achaab, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 2 Kings 3:6 ¶ And king Joram went forth in that day out of Samaria, and numbered Israel. 2 Kings 3:7 And he went and sent to Josaphat king of Juda, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to war? And he said, I will go up: thou art as I, I am as thou; as my people, so is thy people, as my horses, so are thy horses. 2 Kings 3:8 And he said, What way shall I go up? and he said, The way of the wilderness of Edom. 2 Kings 3:9 And the king of Israel went, and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey; and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that went with them. 2 Kings 3:10 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the Lord should have called the three kings on their way, to give them into the hand of Moab. 2 Kings 3:11 And Josaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may enquire of the Lord by him? And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, There is here Elisaie son of Saphat, who poured water on the hands of Eliu. 2 Kings 3:12 And Josaphat said, He has the word of the Lord. And the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, and the king of Edom, went down to him. 2 Kings 3:13 And Elisaie said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, Has the Lord called the three kings to deliver them into the hands of Moab? 2 Kings 3:14 And Elisaie said, As the Lord of hosts before whom I stand lives, unless I regarded the presence of Josaphat the king of Juda, I would not have looked on thee, nor seen thee. 2 Kings 3:15 And now fetch me a harper. And it came to pass, as the harper harped, that the hand of the Lord came upon him. 2 Kings 3:16 And he said, Thus saith the Lord, Make this valley full of trenches. 2 Kings 3:17 For thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain, yet this valley shall be filled with water, and ye, and your flocks, and your cattle shall drink. 2 Kings 3:18 And this is a light thing in the eyes of the Lord: I will also deliver Moab into your hand. 2 Kings 3:19 And ye shall smite every strong city, and ye shall cut down every good tree, and ye shall stop all wells of water, and spoil every good piece of land with stones. 2 Kings 3:20 ¶ And it came to pass in the morning, when the sacrifice was offered, that, behold! waters came from the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water. 2 Kings 3:21 And all Moab heard that the three kings were come up to fight against them; and they cried out on every side, even all that were girt with a girdle, and they said, Ho! and stood upon the border. 2 Kings 3:22 And they rose early in the morning, and the sun rose upon the waters, and Moab saw the waters on the opposite side red as blood. 2 Kings 3:23 And they said, This is the blood of the sword; and the kings have fought, and each man has smitten his neighbour; now then to the spoils, Moab. 2 Kings 3:24 And they entered into the camp of Israel; and Israel arose and smote Moab, and they fled from before them; and they went on and smote Moab as they went. 2 Kings 3:25 And they razed the cities, and cast every man his stone on every good piece of land and filled it; and they stopped every well, and cut down every good tree, until they left only the stones of the wall cast down; and the slingers compassed the land, and smote it. 2 Kings 3:26 And the king of Moab saw that the battle prevailed against him; and he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to cut through to the king of Edom: and they could not. 2 Kings 3:27 And he took his eldest son whom he had designed to reign in his stead, and offered him up for a whole-burnt-offering on the walls. And there was a great indignation against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their land. 2 Kings 4:1 ¶ And one of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried to Elisaie, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant feared the Lord: and the creditor is come to take my two sons to be his servants. 2 Kings 4:2 And Elisaie said, What shall I do for thee? tell me what thou hast in the house. And she said, Thy servant has nothing in the house, except oil wherewith I anoint myself. 2 Kings 4:3 And he said to her, Go, borrow for thyself vessels without of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few. 2 Kings 4:4 And thou shalt go in and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and thou shalt pour forth into these vessels, and remove that which is filled. 2 Kings 4:5 And she departed from him, and shut the door upon herself and upon her sons: they brought the vessels near to her, and she poured in until the vessels were filled. 2 Kings 4:6 And she said to her sons, Bring me yet a vessel. And they said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed. 2 Kings 4:7 And she came and told the man of God: and Elisaie said, Go, and sell the oil, and thou shalt pay thy debts, and thou and thy sons shall live of the remaining oil. 2 Kings 4:8 ¶ And a day came, when Elisaie passed over to Soman, and there was a great lady there, and she constrained him to eat bread: and it came to pass as often as he went into the city, that he turned aside to eat there. 2 Kings 4:9 And the woman said to her husband, See now, I know that this is a holy man of God who comes over continually to us. 2 Kings 4:10 Let us now make for him an upper chamber, a small place; and let us put there for him a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall come to pass that when he comes in to us, he shall turn in thither. 2 Kings 4:11 And a day came, and he went in thither, and turned aside into the upper chamber, and lay there. 2 Kings 4:12 And he said to Giezi his servant, Call me this Somanite. and he called her, and she stood before him. 2 Kings 4:13 And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast taken all this trouble for us; what should I do for thee? Hast thou any request to make to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she said, I dwell in the midst of my people. 2 Kings 4:14 And he said to Giezi, What must we do for her? and Giezi his servant said, Indeed she has no son, and her husband is old. 2 Kings 4:15 And he called her, and she stood by the door. 2 Kings 4:16 And Elisaie said to her, At this time next year, as the season is, thou shalt be alive, and embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, do not lie to thy servant. 2 Kings 4:17 And the woman conceived, and bore a son at the very time, as the season was, being alive, as Elisaie said to her. 2 Kings 4:18 ¶ And the child grew: and it came to pass when he went out to his father to the reapers, 2 Kings 4:19 that he said to his father, My head, my head. and his father said to a servant, carry him to his mother. 2 Kings 4:20 And he carried him to his mother, and he lay upon her knees till noon, and died. 2 Kings 4:21 And she carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of god; and she shut the door upon him, and went out. 2 Kings 4:22 And she called her husband, and said, Send now for me one of the young men, and one of the asses, and I will ride quickly to the man of God, and return. 2 Kings 4:23 And he said, Why art thou going to him to-day? It is neither new moon, nor the Sabbath. And she said, It is well. 2 Kings 4:24 And she saddled the ass, and said to her servant, Be quick, proceed: spare not on my account to ride, unless I shall tell thee. Go, and thou shalt proceed, and come to the man of God to mount Carmel. 2 Kings 4:25 And she rode and came to the man of God to the mountain: and it came to pass when Elisaie saw her coming, that he said to Giezi his servant, See now, that Somanite comes. 2 Kings 4:26 Now run to meet her, and thou shalt say, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? and she said, It is well. 2 Kings 4:27 And she came to Elisaie to the mountain, and laid hold of his feet; and Giezi drew near to thrust her away. And Elisaie said, Let her alone, for her soul is much grieved in her, and the Lord has hidden it from me, and has not told it me. 2 Kings 4:28 And she said, Did I ask a son of my lord? For did I not say, Do not deal deceitfully with me? 2 Kings 4:29 And Elisaie said to Giezi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go: if thou meet any man, thou shalt not salute him, and if a man salute thee thou shalt not answer him: and thou shalt lay my staff on the child's face. 2 Kings 4:30 And the mother of the child said, As the Lord lives and as thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. And Elisaie arose, and went after her. 2 Kings 4:31 And Giezi went on before her, and laid his staff on the child's face: but there was neither voice nor any hearing. So he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked. 2 Kings 4:32 And Elisaie went into the house, and, behold, the dead child was laid upon his bed. 2 Kings 4:33 And Elisaie went into the house, and shut the door upon themselves, the two, and prayed to the Lord. 2 Kings 4:34 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and bowed himself upon him, and the flesh of the child grew warm. 2 Kings 4:35 And he returned, and walked up and down in the house: and he went up, and bowed himself on the child seven times; and the child opened his eyes. 2 Kings 4:36 And Elisaie cried out to Giezi, and said, Call this Somanite. So he called her, and she came in to him: and Elisaie said, Take thy son. 2 Kings 4:37 And the woman went in, and fell at his feet, and did obeisance bowing to the ground; and she took her son, and went out. 2 Kings 4:38 ¶ And Elisaie returned to Galgala: and a famine was in the land; and the sons of the prophets sat before him: and Elisaie said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets. 2 Kings 4:39 And he went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a vine in the field, and gathered of it wild gourds, his garment full; and he cast it into the caldron of pottage, for they knew them not. 2 Kings 4:40 And he poured it out for the men to eat: and it came to pass, when they were eating of the pottage, that lo! they cried out, and said, There is death in the pot, O man of God. And they could not eat. 2 Kings 4:41 And he said, Take meal, and cast it into the pot. And Elisaie said to his servant Giezi, Pour out for the people, and let them eat. And there was no longer there any hurtful thing in the pot. 2 Kings 4:42 And there came a man over from Baetharisa, and brought to the man of God twenty barley loaves and cakes of figs, of the first-fruits. And he said, Give to the people, and let them eat. 2 Kings 4:43 And his servant said, Why should I set this before a hundred men? and he said, Give to the people, and let them eat; for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat and leave. 2 Kings 4:44 And they ate and left, according to the word of the Lord. 2 Kings 5:1 ¶ Now Naiman, the captain of the host of Syria, was a great man before his master, and highly respected, because by him the Lord had given deliverance to Syria, and the man was mighty in strength, but a leper. 2 Kings 5:2 And the Syrians went forth in small bands, and took captive out of the land of Israel a little maid: and she waited on Naiman's wife. 2 Kings 5:3 And she said to her mistress, O that my lord were before the prophet of God in Samaria; then he would recover him from his leprosy. 2 Kings 5:4 And she went in and told her lord, and said, Thus and thus spoke the maid from the land of Israel. 2 Kings 5:5 And the king of Syria said to Naiman, Go to, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he went, and took in his hand ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment. 2 Kings 5:6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now then, as soon as this letter shall reach thee, behold, I have sent to thee my servant Naiman, and thou shalt recover him from his leprosy. 2 Kings 5:7 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he rent his garments, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to recover a man of his leprosy? consider, however, I pray you, and see that this man seeks an occasion against me. 2 Kings 5:8 And it came to pass, when Elisaie heard that the king of Israel had rent his garments, that he sent to the king of Israel, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy garments? Let Naiman, I pray thee, come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel. 2 Kings 5:9 ¶ So Naiman came with horse and chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisaie. 2 Kings 5:10 And Elisaie sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash seven times in Jordan, and thy flesh shall return to thee, and thou shalt be cleansed. 2 Kings 5:11 And Naiman was angry, and departed, and said, Behold, I said, He will by all means come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of his God, and lay his hand upon the place, and recover the leper. 2 Kings 5:12 Are not the Abana and Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not go and wash in them, and be cleansed? and he turned and went away in a rage. 2 Kings 5:13 And his servants came near and said to him, Suppose the prophet had spoken a great thing to thee, wouldest thou not perform it? yet he has but said to thee, Wash, and be cleansed. 2 Kings 5:14 So Naiman went down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the word of Elisaie: and his flesh returned to him as the flesh of a little child, and he was cleansed. 2 Kings 5:15 ¶ And he and all his company returned to Elisaie, and he came and stood before him, and said, Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth, save only in Israel: and now receive a blessing of thy servant. 2 Kings 5:16 And Elisaie said, As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not take one. And he pressed him to take one: but he would not. 2 Kings 5:17 And Naiman said, Well then, if not, let there be given to thy servant, I pray thee, the load of a yoke of mules; and thou shalt give me of the red earth: for henceforth thy servant will not offer whole- burnt-offering or sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord by reason of this thing. 2 Kings 5:18 And l let the Lord be propitious to thy servant when my master goes into the house of Remman to worship there, and he shall lean on my hand, and I shall bow down in the house of Remman when he bows down in the house of Remman; even let the Lord, I pray, be merciful to thy servant in this matter. 2 Kings 5:19 And Elisaie said to Naiman, Go in peace. And he departed from him a little way. 2 Kings 5:20 ¶ And Giezi the servant of Elisaie said, Behold, my Lord has spared this Syrian Naiman, so as not to take of his hand what he has brought: as the Lord lives, I will surely run after him, and take somewhat of him. 2 Kings 5:21 So Giezi followed after Naiman: and Naiman saw him running after him, and turned back from his chariot to meet him. 2 Kings 5:22 And Giezi said, All is well: my master has sent me, saying, Behold, now are there come to me two young men of the sons of the prophets from mount Ephraim; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment. 2 Kings 5:23 And Naiman said, Take two talents of silver. And he took two talents of silver in two bags, and two changes of raiment, and put them upon two of his servants, and they bore them before him. 2 Kings 5:24 And he came to a secret place, and took them from their hands, and laid them up in the house, and dismissed the men. 2 Kings 5:25 And he went in himself and stood before his master; and Elisaie said to him, 2 Kings 5:26 Whence comest thou, Giezi? and Giezi said, Thy servant has not been hither or thither. And Elisaie said to him, Went not my heart with thee, when the man returned from his chariot to meet thee? and now thou hast received silver, and now thou hast received raiment, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants. 2 Kings 5:27 The leprosy also of Naiman shall cleave to thee, and to thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence leprous, like snow. 2 Kings 6:1 ¶ And the sons of the prophets said to Elisaie, Behold now, the place wherein we dwell before thee is too narrow for us. 2 Kings 6:2 Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and make for ourselves a habitation there. 2 Kings 6:3 And he said, Go. And one of them said gently, Come with thy servants. And he said, I will go. 2 Kings 6:4 And he went with them, and they came to Jordan, and began to cut down wood. 2 Kings 6:5 And behold, one was cutting down a beam, and the axe head fell into the water: and he cried out, Alas! master: and it was hidden. 2 Kings 6:6 And the man of God said, Where did it fall? and he shewed him the place: and he broke off a stick, and threw it in there, and the iron came to the surface. 2 Kings 6:7 And he said, Take it up to thyself. And he stretched out his hand, and took it. 2 Kings 6:8 ¶ And the king of Syria was at war with Israel: and he consulted with his servants, saying, I will encamp in such a place. 2 Kings 6:9 And Elisaie sent to the king of Israel, saying, Take heed that thou pass not by that place, for the Syrians are hidden there. 2 Kings 6:10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which Elisaie mentioned to him, and saved himself thence not once or twice. 2 Kings 6:11 And the mind of the king of Syria was very much disturbed concerning this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Will ye not tell me who betrays me to the king of Israel? 2 Kings 6:12 And one of his servants said, Nay, my Lord, O king, for Elisaie the prophet that is in Israel reports to the king of Israel all the words whatsoever thou mayest say in thy bedchamber. 2 Kings 6:13 ¶ And he said, Go, see where this man is, and I will send and take him. And they sent word to him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothaim. 2 Kings 6:14 And he sent thither horses, and chariots, and a mighty host: and they came by night, and compassed about the city. 2 Kings 6:15 And the servant of Elisaie rose up early and went out; and, behold, a host compassed the city, and horses and chariots: and the servant said to him, O master, what shall we do? 2 Kings 6:16 And Elisaie said, Fear not, for they who are with us are more than they that are with them. 2 Kings 6:17 And Elisaie prayed, and said, Lord, open, I pray thee, the eyes of the servant, and let him see. And the Lord opened his eyes, and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses, and there were chariots of fire round about Elisaie. 2 Kings 6:18 And they came down to him; and he prayed to the Lord, and said, Smite, I pray thee, this people with blindness. And he smote them with blindness, according to the word of Elisaie. 2 Kings 6:19 And Elisaie said to them, This is not the city, and this is not the way: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them away to Samaria. 2 Kings 6:20 And it came to pass when they entered into Samaria, that Elisaie said, Open, I pray thee, O Lord, their eyes, and let them see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. 2 Kings 6:21 And the king of Israel said to Elisaie, when he saw them, Shall I not verily smite them, my father? 2 Kings 6:22 And he said, Thou shalt not smite them, unless thou wouldest smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow: set bread and water before them, and let them eat and drink, and depart to their master. 2 Kings 6:23 And he set before them a great feast, and they ate and drank: and he dismissed them and they departed to their master. And the bands of Syria came no longer into the land of Israel. 2 Kings 6:24 ¶ And it came to pass after this, that the son of Ader king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria. 2 Kings 6:25 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was valued at fifty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung at five pieces of silver. 2 Kings 6:26 And the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, and a woman cried to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king. 2 Kings 6:27 And he said to her, Unless the Lord help thee, whence shall I help thee? from the corn-floor, or from the wine-press? 2 Kings 6:28 And the king said to her, What is the matter with thee? And the woman said to him, This woman said to me, Give thy son, and we will eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow. 2 Kings 6:29 So we boiled my son, and ate him; and I said to her on the second day, Give thy son, and let us eat him: and she has hidden her son. 2 Kings 6:30 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel heard the words of the woman, that he rent his garments; and he passed by on the wall, and the people saw sackcloth within upon his flesh. 2 Kings 6:31 And he said, God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisaie shall stand upon him this day. 2 Kings 6:32 And Elisaie was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and the king sent a man before him: before the messenger came to him, he also said to the elders, Do ye see that this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? See, as soon as the messenger shall have come, shut the door, and forcibly detain him at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him? 2 Kings 6:33 While he was yet speaking with them, behold, a messenger came to him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the Lord; why should I wait for the Lord any longer? 2 Kings 7:1 ¶ And Elisaie said, Hear thou the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord, As at this time, to-morrow a measure of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria. 2 Kings 7:2 And the officer on whose hand the king rested, answered Elisaie, and said, Behold, if the Lord shall make flood-gates in heaven, might this thing be? and Elisaie said, Behold, thou shalt see with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. 2 Kings 7:3 ¶ And there were four leprous men by the gate of the city: and one said to his neighbour, Why sit we here until we die? 2 Kings 7:4 If we should say, Let us go into the city, then there is famine in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit here, then we shall die. Now then come, and let us fall upon the camp of the Syrians: if they should take us alive, then we shall live; and if they should put us to death, then we shall only die. 2 Kings 7:5 And they rose up while it was yet night, to go into the camp of Syria; and they came into a part of the camp of Syria, and behold, there was no man there. 2 Kings 7:6 For the Lord had made the army of Syria to hear a sound of chariots, and a sound of horses, even the sound of a great host: and each man said to his fellow, Now has the king of Israel hired against us the kings of the Chettites, and the kings of Egypt, to come against us. 2 Kings 7:7 And they arose and fled while it was yet dark, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses in the camp, as they were, and fled for their lives. 2 Kings 7:8 And these lepers entered a little way into the camp, and went into one tent, and ate and drank, and took thence silver, and gold, and raiment; and they went and returned thence, and entered into another tent, and took thence, and went and hid the spoil. 2 Kings 7:9 And one man said to his neighbour, We are not doing well thus: this day is a day of glad tidings, and we hold our peace, and are waiting till the morning light, and shall find mischief: now them come, and let us go into the city, and report to the house of the king. 2 Kings 7:10 So they went and cried toward the gate of the city, and reported to them, saying, We went into the camp of Syria, and, behold, there is not there a man, nor voice of man, only horses tied and asses, and their tents as they were. 2 Kings 7:11 And the porters cried aloud, and reported to the house of the king within. 2 Kings 7:12 ¶ And the king rose up by night, and said to his servants, I will now tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They knew that we are hungry; and they have gone forth from the camp and hidden themselves in the field, saying, They will come out of the city, and we shall catch them alive, and go into the city. 2 Kings 7:13 And one of his servants answered and said, Let them now take five of the horses that were left, which were left here; behold, they are the number left to all the multitude of Israel; and we will send thither and see. 2 Kings 7:14 So they took two horsemen; and the king of Israel sent after the king of Syria, saying, Go, and see. 2 Kings 7:15 And they went after them even to Jordan: and, behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their panic. and the messengers returned, and brought word to the king. 2 Kings 7:16 And the people went out, and plundered the camp of Syria: and a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord, and two measures of barley for a shekel. 2 Kings 7:17 And the king appointed the officer on whose hand the king leaned to have charge over the gate: and the people trampled on him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the messenger came down to him. 2 Kings 7:18 So it came to pass as Elisaie had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley shall be sold for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel; and it shall be as at this time to-morrow in the gate of Samaria. 2 Kings 7:19 And the officer answered Elisaie, and said, Behold, if the Lord makes flood-gates in heaven, shall this thing be? and Elisaie said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not eat thereof. 2 Kings 7:20 And it was so: for the people trampled on him in the gate, and he died. 2 Kings 8:1 ¶ And Elisaie spoke to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy house, and sojourn wherever thou mayest sojourn: for the Lord has called for a famine upon the land; indeed it is come upon the land for seven years. 2 Kings 8:2 And the woman arose, and did according to the word of Elisaie, both she and her house; and they sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. 2 Kings 8:3 And it came to pass after the expiration of the seven years, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines to the city; and came to cry to the king for her house and for her lands. 2 Kings 8:4 And the king spoke to Giezi the servant of Elisaie the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things which Elisaie has done. 2 Kings 8:5 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life the dead son, behold, the woman whose son Elisaie restored to life came crying to the king for her house and for her lands. And Giezi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisaie restored to life. 2 Kings 8:6 And the king asked the woman, and she told him: and the king appointed her a eunuch, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field from the day that she left the land until now. 2 Kings 8:7 ¶ And Elisaie came to Damascus; and the king of Syria the son of Ader was ill, and they brought him word, saying, The man of God is come hither. 2 Kings 8:8 And the king said to Azael, Take in thine hand a present, and go to meet the man of God, and enquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall I recover of this my disease? 2 Kings 8:9 And Azael went to meet him, and he took a present in his hand, and all the good things of Damascus, forty camels' load, and came and stood before him, and said to Elisaie, Thy son the son of Ader, the king of Syria, has sent me to thee to enquire, saying, Shall I recover of this my disease? 2 Kings 8:10 And Elisaie said, Go, say, Thou shalt certainly live; yet the Lord has shewed me that thou shalt surely die. 2 Kings 8:11 And he stood before him, and fixed his countenance till he was ashamed: and the man of God wept. 2 Kings 8:12 And Azael said, Why does my lord weep? And he said, Because I know all the evil that thou wilt do to the children of Israel: thou wilt utterly destroy their strong holds with fire, and thou wilt slay their choice men with the sword, and thou wilt dash their infants against the ground, and their women with child thou wilt rip up. 2 Kings 8:13 And Azael said, Who is thy servant? a dead dog, that he should do this thing? And Elisaie said, The Lord has shewn me thee ruling over Syria. 2 Kings 8:14 And he departed from Elisaie, and went in to his lord; and he said to him, What said Elisaie to thee? and he said, He said to me, Thou shalt surely live. 2 Kings 8:15 And it came to pass on the next day that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and put it on his face, and he died: and Azael reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 8:16 ¶ In the fifth year of Joram son of Achaab king of Israel, and while Josaphat was king of Juda, Joram the son of Josaphat king of Juda began to reign. 2 Kings 8:17 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 2 Kings 8:18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Achaab; for the daughter of Achaab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord. 2 Kings 8:19 But the Lord would not destroy Juda for David his servant's sake, as he said he would give a light to him and to his sons continually. 2 Kings 8:20 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda, and they made a king over themselves. 2 Kings 8:21 And Joram went up to Sior, and all the chariots that were with him: and it came to pass after he had arisen, that he smote Edom who compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents. 2 Kings 8:22 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda till this day. Then Lobna revolted at that time. 2 Kings 8:23 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 2 Kings 8:24 So Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David: and Ochozias his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 8:25 ¶ In the twelfth year of Joram son of Achaab king of Israel, Ochozias son of Joram began to reign. 2 Kings 8:26 Twenty and two years old was Ochozias when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and the name of his mother was Gotholia, daughter of Ambri king of Israel. 2 Kings 8:27 And he walked in the way of the house of Achaab, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did the house of Achaab. 2 Kings 8:28 And he went with Joram the son of Achaab to war against Azael king of the Syrians in Remmoth Galaad; and the Syrians wounded Joram. 2 Kings 8:29 And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezrael of the wounds with which they wounded him in Remmoth, when he fought with Azael king of Syria. And Ochozias son of Joram went down to see Joram the son of Achaab in Jezrael, because he was sick. 2 Kings 9:1 ¶ And Elisaie the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up thy loins, and take this cruse of oil in thy hand, and go to Remmoth Galaad. 2 Kings 9:2 And thou shalt enter there, and shalt see there Ju the son of Josaphat son of Namessi, and shalt go in and make him rise up from among his brethren, and shalt bring him into a secret chamber. 2 Kings 9:3 And thou shalt take the cruse of oil, and pour it on his head, and say thou, Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel: and thou shalt open the door, and flee, and not tarry. 2 Kings 9:4 And the young man the prophet went to Remmoth Galaad. 2 Kings 9:5 And he went in, and, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have a message to thee, O captain. And Ju said, To which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain. 2 Kings 9:6 And he arose, and went into the house: and he poured the oil upon his head, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed thee to be king over the people of the Lord, even over Israel. 2 Kings 9:7 And thou shalt utterly destroy the house of Achaab thy master from before me, and shalt avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezabel, 2 Kings 9:8 and at the hand of the whole house of Achaab: and thou shalt utterly cut off from the house of Achaab every male, and him that is shut up and left in Israel. 2 Kings 9:9 And I will make the house of Achaab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa the son of Achia. 2 Kings 9:10 And the dogs shall eat Jezabel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled. 2 Kings 9:11 ¶ And Ju went forth to the servants of his lord, and they said to him, Is all well? Why came this mad fellow in to thee? And he said to them, Ye know the man, and his communication. 2 Kings 9:12 And they said, It is wrong: tell us now. And Ju said to them, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying,- and he said, Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee to be king over Israel. 2 Kings 9:13 And when they heard it, they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with the trumpet, and said, Ju is king. 2 Kings 9:14 So Ju the son of Josaphat the son of Namessi conspired against Joram, and Joram was defending Remmoth Galaad, he and all Israel, because of Azael king of Syria. 2 Kings 9:15 And king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezrael of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, in his war with Azael king of Syria. And Ju said, If your heart is with me, let there not go forth out of the city one fugitive to go and report to Jezrael. 2 Kings 9:16 ¶ And Ju rode and advanced, and came down to Jezrael; for Joram king of Israel was getting healed in Jezrael of the arrow-wounds wherewith the Syrians had wounded him in Rammath in the war with Azael king of Syria; for he was strong and a mighty man: and Ochozias king of Juda was come down to see Joram. 2 Kings 9:17 And there went up a watchman upon the tower of Jezrael, and saw the dust made by Ju as he approached; and he said, I see dust. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Peace. 2 Kings 9:18 And there went a horseman to meet them, and said, Thus says the king, Peace. And Ju said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn behind me. And the watchman reported, saying, The messenger came up to them, and has not returned. 2 Kings 9:19 And he sent another horseman, and he came to him, and said, Thus says the king, Peace. And Ju said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn behind me. 2 Kings 9:20 And the watchman reported, saying, He came up to them, and has not returned: and the driver drives Ju the son of Namessi, for it is with furious haste. 2 Kings 9:21 And Joram said, Make ready. And one made ready the chariot: and Joram the king of Israel went forth, and Ochozias king of Juda, each in his chariot, and they went to meet Ju, and found him in the portion of Nabuthai the Jezraelite. 2 Kings 9:22 And it came to pass when Joram saw Ju, that he said, Is it peace, Ju? And Ju said, How can it be peace? as yet there are the whoredoms of thy mother Jezabel, and her abundant witchcrafts. 2 Kings 9:23 And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ochozias, Treachery, Ochozias. 2 Kings 9:24 And Ju bent his bow with his full strength, and smote Joram between his arms, and his arrow went out at his heart, and he bowed upon his knees. 2 Kings 9:25 And Ju said to Badecar his chief officer, Cast him into the portion of ground of Nabuthai the Jezraelite, for I and thou remember, riding as we were on chariots after Achaab his father, that the Lord took up this burden against him, saying, 2 Kings 9:26 Surely, I have seen yesterday the blood of Nabuthai, and the blood of his sons, saith the Lord; and I will recompense him in this portion, saith the Lord. Now then, I pray thee, take him up and cast him into the portion, according to the word of the Lord. 2 Kings 9:27 And Ochozias king of Juda saw it, and fled by the way of Baethgan. And Ju pursued after him, and said, Slay him also. And one smote him in the chariot at the going up of Gai, which is Jeblaam: and he fled to Mageddo, and died there. 2 Kings 9:28 And his servants put him on a chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his sepulchre in the city of David. 2 Kings 9:29 And in the eleventh year of Joram king of Israel, Ochozias began to reign over Juda. 2 Kings 9:30 ¶ And Ju came to Jezrael; and Jezabel heard of it, and coloured her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked through the window. 2 Kings 9:31 And Ju entered into the city; and she said, Had Zambri, the murderer of his master, peace? 2 Kings 9:32 And he lifted up his face toward the window, and saw her, and said, Who art thou? Come down with me. And two eunuchs looked down towards him. 2 Kings 9:33 And he said, Throw her down. And they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and they trampled on her. 2 Kings 9:34 And Ju went in and ate and drank, and said, Look now, after this cursed woman, and bury her, for she is a king's daughter. 2 Kings 9:35 And they went to bury her; but they found nothing of her but the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands. 2 Kings 9:36 And they returned and told him. And he said, It is the word of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of Eliu the Thesbite, saying, In the portion of Jezrael shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezabel. 2 Kings 9:37 And the carcass of Jezabel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezrael, so that they shall not say, This is Jezabel. 2 Kings 10:1 ¶ And Achaab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Ju wrote a letter, and sent it into Samaria to the rulers of Samaria, and to the elders, and to the guardians of the children of Achaab, saying. 2 Kings 10:2 Now then, as soon as this letter shall have reached you, whereas there are with you the sons of your master, and with you chariots and horses, and strong cities, and arms, 2 Kings 10:3 do ye accordingly look out the best and fittest among your master's sons, and set him on the throne of his father, and fight for the house of your master. 2 Kings 10:4 And they feared greatly, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: and how shall we stand? 2 Kings 10:5 So they that were over the house, and they that were over the city, and the elders and the guardians, sent to Ju, saying, We also are thy servants, and whatsoever thou shalt say to us we will do; we will not make any man king: we will do that which is right in thine eyes. 2 Kings 10:6 And Ju wrote them a second letter, saying, If ye are for me, and hearken to my voice, take the heads of the men your master's sons, and bring them to me at this time to-morrow in Jezrael. Now the sons of the king were seventy men; these great men of the city brought them up. 2 Kings 10:7 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew them, even seventy men, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him at Jezrael. 2 Kings 10:8 And a messenger came and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay them in two heaps by the door of the gate until the morning. 2 Kings 10:9 And the morning came, and he went forth, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these? 2 Kings 10:10 See now that there shall not fall to the ground anything of the word of the Lord which the Lord spoke against the house of Achaab: for the Lord has performed all that he spoke of by the hand of his servant Eliu. 2 Kings 10:11 And Ju smote all that were left of the house of Achaab in Jezrael, and all his great men, and his acquaintance, and his priests, so as not to leave him any remnant. 2 Kings 10:12 And he arose and went to Samaria, and he was in the house of sheep-shearing in the way. 2 Kings 10:13 And Ju found the brethren of Ochozias king of Juda, and said, Who are ye? And they said, We are the brethren of Ochozias, and we have come down to salute the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen. 2 Kings 10:14 And he said, Take them alive. And they slew them at the shearing-house, forty and two men: he left not a man of them. 2 Kings 10:15 ¶ And he went thence and found Jonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he saluted him, and Ju said to him, Is thy heart right with my heart, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jonadab said, It is. And Ju said, If it is then, give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot. 2 Kings 10:16 And he said to him, Come with me, and see me zealous for the Lord. And he caused him to sit in his chariot. 2 Kings 10:17 And he entered into Samaria, and smote all that were left of Achaab in Samaria, until he had utterly destroyed him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Eliu. 2 Kings 10:18 And Ju gathered all the people, and said to them, Achaab served Baal a little; Ju shall serve him much. 2 Kings 10:19 Now then do all ye the prophets of Baal call all his servants and his priests to me; let not a man be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal; every one who shall be missing shall die. But Ju did it in subtilty, that he might destroy the servants of Baal. 2 Kings 10:20 And Ju said, Sanctify a solemn festival to Baal, and they made a proclamation. 2 Kings 10:21 And Ju sent throughout all Israel, saying, Now then let all Baal's servants, and all his priests, and all his prophets come, let none be lacking: for I am going to offer a great sacrifice; whosoever shall be missing, shall not live. So all the servants of Baal came, and all his priests, and all his prophets: there was not one left who came not. And they entered into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other. 2 Kings 10:22 And he said to the man who was over the house of the wardrobe, Bring forth a robe for all the servants of Baal. And the keeper of the robes brought forth to them. 2 Kings 10:23 And Ju and Jonadab the son of Rechab entered into the house of Baal, and said to the servants of Baal, Search, and see whether there is among you any of the servants of the Lord, or only the servants of Baal, by themselves. 2 Kings 10:24 And he went in to offer sacrifices and whole-burnt-offerings; and Ju set for himself eighty men without, and said, Every man who shall escape of the men whom I bring into your hand, the life of him that spares him shall go for his life. 2 Kings 10:25 And it came to pass, when he had finished offering the whole-burnt-offering, that Ju said to the footmen and to the officers, Go ye in and slay them; let not a man of them escape. So they smote them with the edge of the sword, and the footmen and the officers cast the bodies forth, and went to the city of the house of Baal. 2 Kings 10:26 And they brought out the pillar of Baal, and burnt it. 2 Kings 10:27 And they tore down the pillars of Baal, and made his house a draught-house until this day. 2 Kings 10:28 So Ju abolished Baal out of Israel. 2 Kings 10:29 ¶ Nevertheless Ju departed not from following the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin: these were the golden heifers in Baethel and in Dan. 2 Kings 10:30 And the Lord said to Ju, Because of all thy deeds wherein thou hast acted well in doing that which was right in my eyes, according to all things which thou hast done to the house of Achaab as they were in my heart, thy sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel. 2 Kings 10:31 But Ju took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart: he departed not from following the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin. 2 Kings 10:32 In those days the Lord began to cut Israel short; and Azael smote them in every coast of Israel; 2 Kings 10:33 from Jordan eastward all the land of Galaad belonging to the Gadites, of Gaddi and that of Ruben, and of Manasses, from Aroer, which is on the brink of the brook of Arnon, and Galaad and Basan. 2 Kings 10:34 And the rest of the acts of Ju, and all that he did, and all his might, and the wars wherein he engaged, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 2 Kings 10:35 And Ju slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joachaz his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 10:36 And the days which Ju reigned over Israel were twenty-eight years in Samaria. 2 Kings 11:1 ¶ And Gotholia the mother of Ochozias saw that her son was dead, and she destroyed all the seed royal. 2 Kings 11:2 And Josabee daughter of king Joram, sister of Ochozias, took Joas the son of her brother, and stole him from among the king's sons that were put to death, secreting him and his nurse in the bedchamber, and hid him from the face of Gotholia, and he was not slain. 2 Kings 11:3 And he remained with her hid in the house of the Lord six years: and Gotholia reigned over the land. 2 Kings 11:4 ¶ And in the seventh year Jodae sent and took the captains of hundreds of the Chorri and of the Rhasim, and brought them to him into the house of the Lord, and made a covenant of the Lord with them, and adjured them, and Jodae shewed them the king's son. 2 Kings 11:5 And charged them, saying, This is the thing which ye shall do. 2 Kings 11:6 Let a third part of you go in on the sabbath-day, and keep ye the watch of the king's house in the porch; and another third in the gate of the high way, and a third at the gate behind the footmen; and keep ye the guard of the house. 2 Kings 11:7 And there shall be two parties among you, even every one that goes out on the Sabbath, and they shall keep the guard of the Lord's house before the king. 2 Kings 11:8 And do ye compass the king about every man with his weapon in his hand, and he that goes into the ranges shall die: and they shall be with the king in his going out and in his coming in. 2 Kings 11:9 And the captains of hundreds did all things that the wise Jodae commanded; and they took each his men, both those that went in on the sabbath-day, and those that went out on the sabbath-day, and went in to Jodae the priest. 2 Kings 11:10 And the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the swords and spears of king David that were in the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 11:11 And the footmen stood each with his weapon in his hand from the right corner of the house to the left corner of the house, by the altar and the house round about the king. 2 Kings 11:12 And he brought forth the king's son, and put upon him the crown and gave him the testimony; and he made him king, and anointed him: and they clapped their hands, and said, Long live the king. 2 Kings 11:13 ¶ And Gotholia heard the sound of the people running, and she went in to the people to the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 11:14 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood near a pillar according to the manner; and the singers and the trumpeters were before the king and all the people of the land even rejoicing and sounding with trumpets: and Gotholia rent her garments, and cried, A conspiracy, a conspiracy. 2 Kings 11:15 And Jodae the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were over the host, and said to them, Bring her forth without the ranges, and he that goes in after her shall certainly die by the sword. For the priest said, Let her not however be slain in the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 11:16 And they laid hands upon her, and went in by the way of the horses' entrance into the house of the Lord, and she was slain there. 2 Kings 11:17 ¶ And Jodae made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people, that they should be the Lord's people; also between the king and the people. 2 Kings 11:18 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and tore it down, and completely broke in pieces his altars and his images, and they slew Mathan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed overseers over the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 11:19 And he took the captains of the hundreds, and the Chorri, and the Rhasim, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king out of the house of the Lord; and they went in by the way of the gate of the footmen of the king's house, and seated him there on the throne of the kings. 2 Kings 11:20 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was at rest: and they slew Gotholia with the sword in the house of the king. 2 Kings 11:21 Joas was seven years old when he began to reign. 2 Kings 12:1 ¶ Joas began to reign in the seventh year of Ju, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Sabia of Bersabee. 2 Kings 12:2 And Joas did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the days that Jodae the priest instructed him. 2 Kings 12:3 Only there were not any of the high places removed, and the people still sacrificed there, and burned incense on the high places. 2 Kings 12:4 ¶ And Joas said to the priests, As for all the money of the holy things that is brought into the house of the Lord, the money of valuation, as each man brings the money of valuation, all the money which any man may feel disposed to bring into the house of the Lord, 2 Kings 12:5 let the priests take it to themselves, every man from the proceeds of his sale: and they shall repair the breaches of the house in all places wheresoever a breach shall be found. 2 Kings 12:6 And it came to pass in the twenty-third year of king Joas the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. 2 Kings 12:7 And king Joas called Jodae the priest, and the other priests, and said to them, Why have ye not repaired the breaches of the house? now then receive no more money from your sales, for ye shall give it to repair the breaches of the house. 2 Kings 12:8 And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, and not to repair the breaches of the house. 2 Kings 12:9 And Jodae the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it by the altar in the house of a man belonging to the house of the Lord, and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was found in the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 12:10 And it came to pass, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest went up, and they tied up and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 12:11 And they gave the money that had been collected into the hands of them that wrought the works, the overseers of the house of the Lord; and they gave it out to the carpenters and to the builders that wrought in the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 12:12 And to the masons, and to the hewers of stone, to purchase timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord, for all that was spent on the house of the Lord to repair it. 2 Kings 12:13 Only there were not to be made for the house of the Lord silver plates, studs, bowls, or trumpets, any vessel of gold or vessel of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord: 2 Kings 12:14 for they were to give it to the workmen, and they repaired therewith the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 12:15 Also they took no account of the men into whose hands they gave the money to give to the workmen, for they acted faithfully. 2 Kings 12:16 Money for a sin-offering, and money for a trespass-offering, whatever happened to be brought into the house of the Lord, went to the priests. 2 Kings 12:17 ¶ Then went up Azael king of Syria, and fought against Geth, and took it: and Azael set his face to go against Jerusalem. 2 Kings 12:18 And Joas king of Juda took all the holy things which Josaphat, and Joram, Ochozias, his fathers, and kings of Juda had consecrated, and what he had himself dedicated, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the Lord's house and the king's house, and he sent them to Azael king of Syria; and he went up from Jerusalem. 2 Kings 12:19 And the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, behold, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 2 Kings 12:20 And his servants rose up and made a conspiracy, and smote Joas in the house of Mallo that is in Sela. 2 Kings 12:21 And Jezirchar the son of Jemuath, and Jezabuth Somer's son, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amessias his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 13:1 ¶ In the twenty-third year of Joas son of Ochozias king of Juda began Joachaz the son of Ju to reign in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years. 2 Kings 13:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin; he departed not from them. 2 Kings 13:3 And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and delivered them into the hand of Azael king of Syria, and into the hand of the son of Ader son of Azael, all their days. 2 Kings 13:4 And Joachaz besought the Lord, and the Lord hearkened to him, for he saw the affliction of Israel, because the king of Syria afflicted them. 2 Kings 13:5 And the Lord gave deliverance to Israel, and they escaped from under the hand of Syria: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as heretofore. 2 Kings 13:6 Only they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who led Israel to sin: they walked in them-moreover the grove also remained in Samaria. 2 Kings 13:7 Whereas there was not left any army to Joachaz, except fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand infantry: for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and they made them as dust for trampling. 2 Kings 13:8 And the rest of the acts of Joachaz, and all that he did, and his mighty acts are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 2 Kings 13:9 And Joachaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria: and Joas his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 13:10 ¶ In the thirty-seventh year of Joas king of Juda, Joas the son of Joachaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria sixteen years. 2 Kings 13:11 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord; he departed not from all the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin: he walked in it. 2 Kings 13:12 And the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, and his mighty acts which he performed together with Amessias king of Juda, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 2 Kings 13:13 And Joas slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat upon his throne, and he was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. 2 Kings 13:14 Now Elisaie was sick of his sickness, whereof he died: and Joas king of Israel went down to him, and wept over his face, and said, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof! 2 Kings 13:15 And Elisaie said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took to himself a bow and arrows. 2 Kings 13:16 And he said to the king, Put thy hand on the bow. And Joas put his hand upon it: and Elisaie put his hands upon the king's hands. 2 Kings 13:17 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. And Elisaie said, Shoot. And he shot. And Elisaie said, The arrow of the Lord's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; and thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphec until thou have consumed them. 2 Kings 13:18 And Elisaie said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And the king smote three times, and stayed. 2 Kings 13:19 And the man of God was grieved at him, and said, If thou hadst smitten five or six times, then thou shouldest have smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed them; but now thou shalt smite Syria only thrice. 2 Kings 13:20 ¶ And Elisaie died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites came into the land, at the beginning of the year. 2 Kings 13:21 And it came to pass as they were burying a man, that behold, they saw a band of men, and they cast the man into the grave of Elisaie: and as soon as he touched the bones of Elisaie, he revived and stood up on his feet. 2 Kings 13:22 And Azael greatly afflicted Israel all the days of Joachaz. 2 Kings 13:23 And the Lord had mercy and compassion upon them, and had respect to them because of his covenant with Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob; and the Lord would not destroy them, and did not cast them out from his presence. 2 Kings 13:24 And Azael king of Syria died, and the son of Ader his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 13:25 And Joas the son of Joachaz returned, and took the cities out of the hand of the son of Ader the son of Azael, which he had taken out of the hand of Joachaz his father in the war: thrice did Joas smite him, and he recovered the cities of Israel. 2 Kings 14:1 ¶ In the second year of Joas the son of Joachaz king of Israel, did Amessias also the son of Joas the king of Juda begin to reign. 2 Kings 14:2 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Joadim of Jerusalem. 2 Kings 14:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not as David his father: he did according to all things that his father Joas did. 2 Kings 14:4 Only he removed not the high places: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places. 2 Kings 14:5 And it came to pass when the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants that had slain the king his father. 2 Kings 14:6 But he slew not the sons of those that had slain him; according as it is written in the book of the laws of Moses, as the Lord gave commandment, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, and the children shall not be put to death for the fathers; but every one shall die for his own sins. 2 Kings 14:7 He smote of Edom ten thousand in the valley of salt, and took the Rock in the war, and called its name Jethoel until this day. 2 Kings 14:8 ¶ Then Amessias sent messengers to Joas son of Joachaz son of Ju king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face. 2 Kings 14:9 And Joas the king of Israel sent to Amessias king of Juda, saying, The thistle that was in Libanus sent to the cedar that was in Libanus, saying, Give my daughter to thy son to wife: and the wild beasts of the field that were in Libanus passed by and trod down the thistle. 2 Kings 14:10 Thou hast smitten and wounded Edom, and thy heart has lifted thee up: stay at home and glorify thyself; for wherefore art thou quarrelsome to thy hurt? So both thou wilt fall and Juda with thee. 2 Kings 14:11 Nevertheless Amessias hearkened not: so Joas king of Israel went up, and he and Amessias king of Juda looked one another in the face in Baethsamys of Juda. 2 Kings 14:12 And Juda was overthrown before Israel, and every man fled to his tent. 2 Kings 14:13 And Joas king of Israel took Amessias the son of Joas the son of Ochozias, in Baethsamys; and he came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, beginning at the gate of Ephraim as far as the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits. 2 Kings 14:14 And he took the gold, and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house, and the hostages, and returned to Samaria. 2 Kings 14:15 ¶ And the rest of the acts of Joas, even all that he did in his might, how he warred with Amessias king of Juda, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 2 Kings 14:16 And Joas slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 14:17 And Amessias the son of Joas king of Juda lived after the death of Joas son of Joachaz king of Israel fifteen years. 2 Kings 14:18 And the rest of the acts of Amessias, and all that he did, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 2 Kings 14:19 And they formed a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachis: and they sent after him to Lachis, and slew him there. 2 Kings 14:20 And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 2 Kings 14:21 And all the people of Juda took Azarias, and he was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amessias. 2 Kings 14:22 He built Aeloth, and restored it to Juda, after the king slept with his fathers. 2 Kings 14:23 ¶ In the fifteenth year of Amessias son of Joas king of Juda began Jeroboam son of Joas to reign over Israel in Samaria forty and one years. 2 Kings 14:24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin. 2 Kings 14:25 He recovered the coast of Israel from the entering in of Aemath to the sea of Araba, according to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonas the son of Amathi, the prophet of Gethchopher. 2 Kings 14:26 For the Lord saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter, and that they were few in number, straitened and in want, and destitute, and Israel had no helper. 2 Kings 14:27 And the Lord said that he would not blot out the seed of Israel from under heaven; so he delivered them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joas. 2 Kings 14:28 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did, and his mighty deeds, which he achieved in war, and how he recovered Damascus and Aemath to Juda in Israel, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 2 Kings 14:29 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zacharias his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 15:1 ¶ In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel Azarias the son of Amessias king of Juda began to reign. 2 Kings 15:2 Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechelia of Jerusalem. 2 Kings 15:3 And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, according to all things that Amessias his father did. 2 Kings 15:4 Only he took not away any of the high places: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places. 2 Kings 15:5 And the Lord plagued the king, and he was leprous till the day of his death; and he reigned in a separate house. And Joatham the king's son was over the household, judging the people of the land. 2 Kings 15:6 And the rest of the acts of Azarias, and all that he did, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 2 Kings 15:7 And Azarias slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Joatham his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 15:8 ¶ In the thirty and eighth year of Azarias king of Juda Zacharias the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in Samaria six months. 2 Kings 15:9 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his fathers had done: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin. 2 Kings 15:10 And Sellum the son of Jabis and others conspired against him, and they smote him in Keblaam, and slew him, and he reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 15:11 And the rest of the acts of Zacharias, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 2 Kings 15:12 This was the word of the Lord which he spoke to Ju, saying, Thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel: and it was so. 2 Kings 15:13 And Sellum the son of Jabis reigned: and in the thirty and ninth year of Azarias king of Juda began Sellum to reign a full month in Samaria. 2 Kings 15:14 And Manaem the son of Gaddi went up out of Tharsila, and came to Samaria, and smote Sellum the son of Jabis in Samaria, and slew him. 2 Kings 15:15 And the rest of the acts of Sellum, and his conspiracy wherein he was engaged, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 2 Kings 15:16 Then Manaem smote both Thersa and all that was in it, and its borders extending beyond Thersa, because they opened not to him: and he smote it, and ripped up the women with child. 2 Kings 15:17 In the thirty and ninth year of Azarias king of Juda began Manaem the son of Gaddi to reign over Israel in Samaria ten years. 2 Kings 15:18 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin. 2 Kings 15:19 In his days went up Phua king of the Assyrians against the land: and Manaem gave to Phua a thousand talents of silver to aid him with his power. 2 Kings 15:20 And Manaem raised the silver by a tax upon Israel, even on every mighty man in wealth, to give to the king of the Assyrians, fifty shekels levied on each man; and the king of the Assyrians departed, and remained not there in the land. 2 Kings 15:21 And the rest of the acts of Manaem, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 2 Kings 15:22 And Manaem slept with his fathers; and Phakesias his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 15:23 In the fiftieth year of Azarias king of Juda, began Phakesias the son of Manaem to reign over Israel in Samaria two years. 2 Kings 15:24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin. 2 Kings 15:25 And Phakee the son of Romelias, his officer, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria in the front of the king's house, with Argob and Aria, and with him there were fifty men of the four hundred: and he slew him, and reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 15:26 And the rest of the acts of Phakesias, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 2 Kings 15:27 In the fifty-second year of Azarias king of Juda began Phakee the son of Romelias to reign over Israel in Samaria twenty years. 2 Kings 15:28 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin. 2 Kings 15:29 In the days of Phakee king of Israel came Thalgath-phellasar king of the Assyrians, and took Ain, and Abel, and Thamaacha, and Anioch, and Kenez, and Asor, and Galaa, and Galilee, even all the land of Nephthali, and carried them away to the Assyrians. 2 Kings 15:30 And Osee son of Ela formed a conspiracy against Phakee the son of Romelias, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Joatham the son of Azarias. 2 Kings 15:31 And the rest of the acts of Phakee, and all that he did, behold, these are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 2 Kings 15:32 ¶ In the second year of Phakee son of Romelias king of Israel began Joatham the son of Azarias king of Juda to reign. 2 Kings 15:33 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jerusa daughter of Sadoc. 2 Kings 15:34 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all things that his father Azarias did. 2 Kings 15:35 Nevertheless he took not away the high places: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places. He built the upper gate of the Lord's house. 2 Kings 15:36 And the rest of the acts of Joatham, and all that he did, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 2 Kings 15:37 In those days the Lord began to send forth against Juda Raasson king of Syria, and Phakee son of Romelias. 2 Kings 15:38 And Joatham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Achaz his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 16:1 ¶ In the seventeenth year of Phakee son of Romelias began Achaz the son of Joatham king of Juda to reign. 2 Kings 16:2 Twenty years old was Achaz when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not that which was right in the eyes of the Lord his God faithfully, as David his father had done . 2 Kings 16:3 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, he made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel. 2 Kings 16:4 And he sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places, and upon the hills, and under every shady tree. 2 Kings 16:5 ¶ Then went up Raasson king of Syria and Phakee son of Romelias king of Israel against Jerusalem to war, and besieged Achaz, but could not prevail against him. 2 Kings 16:6 At that time Raasson king of Syria recovered Aelath to Syria, and drove out the Jews from Aelath, and the Idumeans came to Aelath, and dwelt there until this day. 2 Kings 16:7 And Achaz sent messengers to Thalgath-phellasar king of the Assyrians, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, deliver me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me. 2 Kings 16:8 And Achaz took the silver and the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and sent gifts to the king. 2 Kings 16:9 And the king of the Assyrians hearkened to him: and the king of the Assyrians went up to Damascus and took it, and removed the inhabitants, and slew king Raasson. 2 Kings 16:10 ¶ And king Achaz went to Damascus to meet Thalgath-phellasar king of the Assyrians at Damascus; and he saw an altar at Damascus. And king Achaz sent to Urias the priest the pattern of the altar, and its proportions, and all its workmanship. 2 Kings 16:11 And Urias the priest built the altar, according to all the directions which king Achaz sent from Damascus. 2 Kings 16:12 And the king saw the altar, and went up to it, 2 Kings 16:13 and offered his whole-burnt-offering, and his meat-offering, and his drink-offering, and poured out the blood of his peace-offerings on the brazen altar that was before the Lord. 2 Kings 16:14 And he brought forward the one before the house of the Lord from between the altar and the house of the Lord, and he set it openly by the side of the altar northwards. 2 Kings 16:15 And king Achaz charged Urias the priest, saying, Offer upon the great altar the whole-burnt- offering in the morning and the meat-offering in the evening, and the whole-burnt-offering of the king, and his meat-offering, and the whole-burnt-offering of all the people, and their meat-offering, and their drink-offering; and thou shalt pour all the blood of the whole-burnt-offering, and all the blood of any other sacrifice upon it: and the brazen altar shall be for me in the morning. 2 Kings 16:16 And Urias the priest did according to all that king Achaz commanded him. 2 Kings 16:17 ¶ And king Achaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from the brazen oxen that were under it, and set it upon a base of stone. 2 Kings 16:18 And he made a base for the throne in the house of the Lord, and he turned the king's entrance without in the house of the Lord because of the king of the Assyrians. 2 Kings 16:19 And the rest of the acts of Achaz, even all that he did, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 2 Kings 16:20 And Achaz slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Ezekias his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 17:1 ¶ In the twelfth year of Achaz king of Juda began Osee the son of Ela to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years. 2 Kings 17:2 And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord, only not as the kings of Israel that were before him. 2 Kings 17:3 Against him came up Salamanassar king of the Assyrians; and Osee became his servant, and rendered him tribute. 2 Kings 17:4 And the king of the Assyrians found iniquity in Osee, in that he sent messengers to Segor king of Egypt, and brought not a tribute to the king of the Assyrians in that year: and the king of the Assyrians besieged him, and bound him in the prison-house. 2 Kings 17:5 And the king of the Assyrians went up against all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years. 2 Kings 17:6 In the ninth year of Osee the king of the Assyrians took Samaria, and carried Israel away to the Assyrians, and settled them in Alae, and in Abor, near the rivers of Gozan, and in the mountains of the Medes. 2 Kings 17:7 ¶ For it came to pass that the children of Israel had transgressed against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharao king of Egypt, and they feared other gods, 2 Kings 17:8 and walked in the statutes of the nations which the Lord cast out before the face of the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel as many as did such things, 2 Kings 17:9 and in those of the children of Israel as many as secretly practised customs, not as they should have done, against the Lord their God: 2 Kings 17:10 and they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city. And they made for themselves pillars and groves on every high hill, and under every shady tree. 2 Kings 17:11 And burned incense there on all high places, as the nations did whom the Lord removed from before them, and dealt with familiar spirits, and they carved images to provoke the Lord to anger. 2 Kings 17:12 And they served the idols, of which the Lord said to them, Ye shall not do this thing against the Lord. 2 Kings 17:13 And the Lord testified against Israel and against Juda, even by the hand of all his prophets, and of every seer, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my ordinances, and all the law which I commanded your fathers, and all that I sent to them by the hand of my servants the prophets. 2 Kings 17:14 But they hearkened not, and made their neck harder than the neck of their fathers. 2 Kings 17:15 And they kept not any of his testimonies which he charged them; and they walked after vanities, and became vain, and after the nations round about them, concerning which the Lord had charged them not to do accordingly. 2 Kings 17:16 They forsook the commandments of the Lord their God, and made themselves graven images, even two heifers, and they made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal. 2 Kings 17:17 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divinations and auspices, and sold themselves to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him. 2 Kings 17:18 And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight; and there was only left the tribe of Juda quite alone. 2 Kings 17:19 Nay even Juda kept not the commandments of the Lord their God, but they walked according to the customs of Israel which they practised, and rejected the Lord. 2 Kings 17:20 And the Lord was angry with the whole seed of Israel, and troubled them, and gave them into the hand of them that spoiled them, until he cast them out of his presence. 2 Kings 17:21 Forasmuch as Israel revolted from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nabat king: and Jeroboam drew off Israel from following the Lord, and led them to sin a great sin. 2 Kings 17:22 And the children of Israel walked in all the sin of Jeroboam which he committed; they departed not from it, 2 Kings 17:23 until the Lord removed Israel from his presence, as the Lord spoke by all his servants the prophets; and Israel was removed from off their land to the Assyrians until this day. 2 Kings 17:24 ¶ And the king of Assyria brought from Babylon the men of Chutha, and men from Aia, and from Aemath, and Seppharvaim, and they were settled in the cities of Samaria in the place of the children of Israel: and they inherited Samaria, and were settled in its cities. 2 Kings 17:25 And it was so at the beginning of their establishment there that they feared not the Lord, and the Lord sent lions among them, and they slew some of them. 2 Kings 17:26 And they spoke to the king of the Assyrians, saying, The nations whom thou hast removed and substituted in the cities of Samaria for the Israelites, know not the manner of the God of the land: and he has sent the lions against them, and, behold, they are slaying them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land. 2 Kings 17:27 And the king of the Assyrians commanded, saying, Bring some Israelites thence, and let them go and dwell there, and they shall teach them the manner of the God of the land. 2 Kings 17:28 And they brought one of the priests whom they had removed from Samaria, and he settled in Baethel, and taught them how they should fear the Lord. 2 Kings 17:29 But the nations made each their own gods, and put them in the house of the high places which the Samaritans had made, each nation in the cities in which they dwelt. 2 Kings 17:30 And the men of Babylon made Socchoth Benith, and the men of Chuth made Ergel, and the men of Haemath made Asimath. 2 Kings 17:31 And the Evites made Eblazer and Tharthac, and the inhabitant of Seppharvaim did evil when they burnt their sons in the fire to Adramelech and Anemelech, the gods of Seppharvaim. 2 Kings 17:32 And they feared the Lord, yet they established their abominations in the houses of the high places which they made in Samaria, each nation in the city in which they dwelt: and they feared the Lord, and they made for themselves priests of the high places, and sacrificed for themselves in the house of the high places. 2 Kings 17:33 And they feared the Lord, and served their gods according to the manner of the nations, whence their lords brought them. 2 Kings 17:34 Until this day they did according to their manner: they fear the Lord, and they do according to their customs, and according to their manner, and according to the law, and according to the commandment which the Lord commanded the sons of Jacob, whose name he made Israel. 2 Kings 17:35 And the Lord made a covenant with them, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, neither shall ye worship them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them: 2 Kings 17:36 but only to the Lord, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great strength and with a high arm: him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship; to him shall ye sacrifice. 2 Kings 17:37 Ye shall observe continually the ordinances, and the judgments, and the law, and the commandments which he wrote for you to do; and ye shall not fear other gods. 2 Kings 17:38 Neither shall ye forget the covenant which he made with you: and ye shall not fear other gods. 2 Kings 17:39 But ye shall fear the Lord your God, and he shall deliver you from all your enemies. 2 Kings 17:40 Neither shall ye comply with their practice, which they follow. 2 Kings 17:41 So these nations feared the Lord, and served their graven images: yea, their sons and their son's sons do until this day even as their fathers did. 2 Kings 18:1 ¶ And it came to pass in the third year of Osee son of Ela king of Israel that Ezekias son of Achaz king of Juda began to reign. 2 Kings 18:2 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abu, daughter of Zacharias. 2 Kings 18:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father David did. 2 Kings 18:4 He removed the high places, and broke in pieces the pillars, and utterly destroyed the groves, and the brazen serpent which Moses made: because until those days the children of Israel burnt incense to it: and he called it Neesthan. 2 Kings 18:5 He trusted in the Lord God of Israel; and after him there was not any like him among the kings of Juda, nor among those that were before him. 2 Kings 18:6 And he clave to the Lord, he departed not from following him; and he kept his commandments, as many as he commanded Moses. 2 Kings 18:7 And the Lord was with him; and he was wise in all that he undertook: and he revolted from the king of the Assyrians, and served him not. 2 Kings 18:8 He smote the Philistines even to Gaza, and to the border of it, from the tower of the watchmen even to the strong city. 2 Kings 18:9 ¶ And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Ezekias (this is the seventh year of Osee son of Ela king of Israel,) that Salamanassar king of the Assyrians came up against Samaria, and besieged it. 2 Kings 18:10 And he took it at the end of three years, in the sixth year of Ezekias, (this is the ninth year of Osee king of Israel, when Samaria was taken.) 2 Kings 18:11 And the king of the Assyrians carried away the Samaritans to Assyria, and put them in Alae and in Abor, by the river Gozan, and in the mountains of the Medes; 2 Kings 18:12 because they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord their God, and transgressed his covenant, even in all things that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded, and hearkened not to them, nor did them. 2 Kings 18:13 And in the fourteenth year of king Ezekias came up Sennacherim king of the Assyrians against the strong cities of Juda, and took them. 2 Kings 18:14 And Ezekias king of Juda sent messengers to the king of the Assyrians to Lachis, saying, I have offended; depart from me: whatsoever thou shalt lay upon me, I will bear. And the king of Assyria laid upon Ezekias king of Juda a tribute of three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold. 2 Kings 18:15 And Ezekias gave all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house. 2 Kings 18:16 At that time Ezekias cut off the gold from the doors of the temple, and from the pillars which Ezekias king of Juda had overlaid with gold, and gave it to the king of the Assyrians. 2 Kings 18:17 ¶ And the king of the Assyrians sent Tharthan and Raphis and Rapsakes from Lachis to king Ezekias with a strong force against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem, and stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is by the way of the fuller's field. 2 Kings 18:18 And they cried to Ezekias: and there came to him Heliakim the son of Chelcias the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and Joas the son of Saphat the recorder. 2 Kings 18:19 And Rapsakes said to them, Say now to Ezekias, Thus says the king, the great king of the Assyrians, What is this confidence wherein thou trustest? 2 Kings 18:20 Thou hast said, (but they are mere words,) I have counsel and strength for war. Now then in whom dost thou trust, that thou hast revolted from me? 2 Kings 18:21 See now, art thou trusting for thyself on this broken staff of reed, even upon Egypt? whosoever shall stay himself upon it, it shall even go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharao king of Egypt to all that trust on him. 2 Kings 18:22 And whereas thou hast said to me, We trust on the Lord God: is not this he, whose high places and altars Ezekias has removed, and has said to Juda and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem? 2 Kings 18:23 And now, I pray you, make and agreement with my lord the king of the Assyrians, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou shalt be able on thy part to set riders upon them. 2 Kings 18:24 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one petty governor, from among the least of my lord's servants? whereas thou trustest for thyself on Egypt for chariots and horsemen. 2 Kings 18:25 And now have we come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it? The Lord said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it. 2 Kings 18:26 And Heliakim the son of Chelkias, and Somnas, and Joas, said to Rapsakes, Speak now to thy servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it; and speak not with us in the Jewish language: and why dost thou speak in the ears of the people that are on the wall? 2 Kings 18:27 And Rapsakes said to them, Has my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own water together with you. 2 Kings 18:28 And Rapsakes stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and spoke, and said, Hear the words of the great king of the Assyrians: 2 Kings 18:29 thus says the king, Let not Ezekias encourage you with words: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand. 2 Kings 18:30 And let not Ezekias cause you to trust on the Lord, saying, The Lord will certainly deliver us; this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians: hearken not to Ezekias: 2 Kings 18:31 for thus says the king of the Assyrians, Gain my favour, and come forth to me, and every man shall drink of the wine of his own vine, and every man shall eat of his own fig-tree, and shall drink water out of his own cistern; 2 Kings 18:32 until I come and remove you to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, and bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil, and honey, and ye shall live and not die: and do not ye hearken to Ezekias, for he deceives you, saying, The Lord shall deliver you. 2 Kings 18:33 Have the Gods of the nations at all delivered each their own land out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians? 2 Kings 18:34 Where is the god of Haemath, and of Arphad? where is the god of Seppharvaim, Ana, and Aba? for have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 2 Kings 18:35 Who is there among all the gods of the countries, who have delivered their countries out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? 2 Kings 18:36 But the men were silent, and answered him not a word: for there was a commandment of the king, saying, Ye shall not answer him. 2 Kings 18:37 And Heliakim the son of Chelcias, the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and Joas the son of Saphat the recorder came in to Ezekias, having rent their garments; and they reported to him the words of Rapsakes. 2 Kings 19:1 ¶ And it came to pass when king Ezekias heard it, that he rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth, an went into the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 19:2 And he sent Heliakim the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and the elders of the priests, clothed with sackcloth, to Esaias the prophet the son of Amos. 2 Kings 19:3 And they said to him, Thus says Ezekias, This day is a day of tribulation, and rebuke, and provocation: for the children are come to the travail-pangs, but the mother has no strength. 2 Kings 19:4 Peradventure the Lord thy God will hear all the words of Rapsakes, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God and to revile him with the words which the Lord thy God has heard: and thou shalt offer thy prayer for the remnant that is found. 2 Kings 19:5 So the servants of king Ezekias came to Esaias. 2 Kings 19:6 And Esaias said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed. 2 Kings 19:7 Behold, I send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a report, and shall return to his own land; and I will overthrow him with the sword in his own land. 2 Kings 19:8 ¶ So Rapsakes returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Lobna: for he heard that he had departed from Lachis. 2 Kings 19:9 And he heard concerning Tharaca king of the Ethiopians, saying, Behold, he is come forth to fight with thee: and he returned, and sent messengers to Ezekias, saying, 2 Kings 19:10 Let not thy God on whom thou trustest encourage thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of the Assyrians. 2 Kings 19:11 Behold, thou hast heard all that the kings of the Assyrians have done in all the lands, to waste them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered? 2 Kings 19:12 Have the gods of the nations at all delivered them, whom my fathers destroyed; both Gozan, and Charran, and Raphis, and the sons of Edem who were in Thaesthen? 2 Kings 19:13 Where is the king of Haemath, and the king of Arphad? and where is the king of the city of Seppharvaim, of Ana, and Aba? 2 Kings 19:14 And Ezekias took the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and he went up to the house of the Lord, an Ezekias spread it before the Lord, 2 Kings 19:15 and said, O Lord God of Israel that dwellest over the cherubs, thou art the only god in all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth. 2 Kings 19:16 Incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear: open, Lord, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherim, which he has sent to reproach the living God. 2 Kings 19:17 For truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have wasted the nations, 2 Kings 19:18 and have cast their gods into the fire: because they are no gods, but the works of men's hands, wood and stone; and they have destroyed them. 2 Kings 19:19 And now, O Lord our God, deliver us out of his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall know that thou alone art the Lord God. 2 Kings 19:20 ¶ And Esaias the son of Amos sent to Ezekias, saying, Thus saith the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, I have heard thy prayer to me concerning Sennacherim king of the Assyrians. 2 Kings 19:21 This is the word which the Lord has spoken against him; The virgin daughter of Sion has made light of thee, and mocked thee; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee. 2 Kings 19:22 Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast thou reviled? and against whom hast thou lifted up thy voice, and raised thine eyes on high? Is it against the Holy One of Israel? 2 Kings 19:23 by thy messengers thou has reproached the Lord, and hast said, I will go up with the multitude of my chariots, to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Libanus, and I have cut down the height of his cedar, and his choice cypresses; and I have come into the midst of the forest and of Carmel. 2 Kings 19:24 I have refreshed myself, and have drunk strange waters, and I have dried up with the sole of my foot all the rivers of fortified places. 2 Kings 19:25 I have brought about the matter, I have brought it to a conclusion; and it is come to the destruction of the bands of warlike prisoners, even of strong cities. 2 Kings 19:26 And they that dwelt in them were weak in hand, they quaked and were confounded, they became as grass of the field, or as the green herb, the grass growing on houses, and that which is trodden down by him that stands upon it. 2 Kings 19:27 But I know thy down-sitting, and thy going forth, and thy rage against me. 2 Kings 19:28 Because thou was angry against me, and thy fierceness is come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hooks in thy nostrils, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. 2 Kings 19:29 And this shall be a sign to thee; eat this year the things that grow of themselves, and in the second year the things which spring up: and in the third year let there be sowing, and reaping, and planting of vineyards, and eat ye the fruit of them. 2 Kings 19:30 And he shall increase him that has escaped of the house of Juda: and the remnant shall strike root beneath, and it shall produce fruit above. 2 Kings 19:31 For from Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and he that escapes from the mountain of Sion: the zeal of the Lord of host shall do this. 2 Kings 19:32 Is it not so? Thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians, He shall not enter into this city, and he shall not shoot an arrow there, neither shall a shield come against it, neither shall he heap a mound against it. 2 Kings 19:33 By the way by which he comes, by it shall he return, and he shall not enter into this city, saith the Lord. 2 Kings 19:34 And I will defend this city as with a shield, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake. 2 Kings 19:35 ¶ And it came to pass at night that the angel of the Lord went forth, an smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand: and they rose early in the morning, and, behold, these were all dead corpses. 2 Kings 19:36 And Sennacherim king of the Assyrians departed, and went and returned, and dwelt in Nineve. 2 Kings 19:37 And it came to pass, while he was worshipping in the house of Meserach his god, that Adramelech and Sarasar his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararath; and Asordan his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 20:1 ¶ In those days was Ezekias sick even to death. And the prophet Esaias the son of Amos came in to him, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Give charge to thy household; for thou shalt die, and not live. 2 Kings 20:2 And Ezekias turned to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying, 2 Kings 20:3 Lord, remember, I pray thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thine eyes. And Ezekias wept with a great weeping. 2 Kings 20:4 And Esaias was in the middle court, and the word of the Lord came to him, saying, 2 Kings 20:5 Turn back, and thou shalt say to Ezekias the ruler of my people, Thus saith the Lord God of thy father David, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up to the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 20:6 And I will add to thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant's David sake. 2 Kings 20:7 And he said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it upon the ulcer, and he shall be well. 2 Kings 20:8 And Ezekias said to Esaias, What is the sign that the Lord will heal me, and I shall go up to the house of the Lord on the third day? 2 Kings 20:9 And Esaias said, This is the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will perform the word which he has spoken, the shadow of the dial shall advance ten degrees: or if it should go back ten degrees this would also be the sign. 2 Kings 20:10 And Ezekias said, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return ten degrees backward on the dial. 2 Kings 20:11 And Esaias the prophet cried to the Lord: and the shadow returned back ten degrees on the dial. 2 Kings 20:12 ¶ At that time Marodach Baladan, son of Baladan king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Ezekias, because he had heard that Ezekias was sick. 2 Kings 20:13 And Ezekias rejoiced at them, and shewed all the house of his spices, the silver and the gold, the spices, and the fine oil, and the armory, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing which Ezekias did not shew them in his house, and in all his dominion. 2 Kings 20:14 And Esaias the prophet went in to king Ezekias, and said to him, What said these men? and whence came they to thee? And Ezekias said, they came to me from a distant land, even from Babylon. 2 Kings 20:15 And he said, What saw they in thy house? And he said, They saw all things that are in my house: there was nothing in my house which I shewed not to them; yea, all that was in my treasures also. 2 Kings 20:16 And Esaias said to Ezekias, Hear the word of the Lord: 2 Kings 20:17 Behold, the days come, that all things that are in thy house shall be taken, and all that thy fathers have treasured up until this day, to Babylon; and there shall not fail a word, which the Lord has spoken. 2 Kings 20:18 And as for thy sons which shall come forth of thee, which thou shalt beget, the enemy shall take them, and they shall be eunuchs in the house of the king of Babylon. 2 Kings 20:19 And Ezekias said to Esaias, Good is the word of the Lord which he has spoken: only let there be peace in my days. 2 Kings 20:20 And the rest of the acts of Ezekias, and all his might, and all that he made, the fountain and the aqueduct, and how he brought water into the city, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 2 Kings 20:21 And Ezekias slept with his fathers: and Manasses his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 21:1 ¶ Manasses was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Apsiba. 2 Kings 21:2 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel. 2 Kings 21:3 And he built again the high places, which Ezekias his father had demolished; and set up an altar to Baal, and made groves as Achaab king of Israel made them; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 2 Kings 21:4 And he built an altar in the house of the Lord, whereas he had said, In Jerusalem I will place my name. 2 Kings 21:5 And he built an altar to all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 21:6 And he caused his sons to pass through the fire, and used divination and auspices, and made groves, and multiplied wizards, so as to do that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger. 2 Kings 21:7 And he set up the graven image of the grove in the house of which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I even place my name for ever. 2 Kings 21:8 And I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I gave to their fathers, even of those who shall keep all that I commanded, according to all the commandments which my servant Moses commanded them. 2 Kings 21:9 But they hearkened not; and Manasses led them astray to do evil in the sight of the Lord, beyond the nations whom the Lord utterly destroyed from before the children of Israel. 2 Kings 21:10 ¶ And the Lord spoke by his servants the prophets, saying, 2 Kings 21:11 Forasmuch as Manasses the king of Juda has wrought all these evil abominations, beyond all that the Amorite did, who lived before him, and has led Juda also into sin by their idols, 2 Kings 21:12 it shall not be so. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I bring calamities upon Jerusalem and Juda, so that both the ears of every one that hears shall tingle. 2 Kings 21:13 And I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measure of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Achaab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a jar is wiped, and turned upside down in the wiping. 2 Kings 21:14 And I will reject the remnant of my inheritance, and will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; and they shall be for a plunder and for a spoil to all their enemies: 2 Kings 21:15 forasmuch as they have done wickedly in my sight, and have provoked me from the day that I brought out their fathers out of Egypt, even until this day. 2 Kings 21:16 Moreover Manasses shed very much innocent blood, until he filled Jerusalem with it from one end to the other, beside his sins with which he caused Juda to sin, in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord. 2 Kings 21:17 And the rest of the acts of Manasses, and all that he did, and his sin which he sinned, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 2 Kings 21:18 And Manasses slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his house, even in the garden of Oza: and Amos his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 21:19 ¶ Twenty and two years old was Amos when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Mesollam, daughter of Arus of Jeteba. 2 Kings 21:20 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as Manasses his father did. 2 Kings 21:21 And he walked in all the way in which his father walked, and served the idols which his father served, and worshipped them. 2 Kings 21:22 And he forsook the Lord God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord. 2 Kings 21:23 And the servants of Amos conspired against him, and slew the king in his house. 2 Kings 21:24 And the people of the land slew all that had conspired against king Amos; and the people of the land made Josias king in his room. 2 Kings 21:25 And the rest of the acts of Amos, even all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 2 Kings 21:26 And they buried him in his tomb in the garden of Oza: and Josias his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 22:1 ¶ Josias was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jedia, daughter of Edeia of Basuroth. 2 Kings 22:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father; he turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. 2 Kings 22:3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josias, in the eighth month, the king sent Sapphan the son of Ezelias the son of Mesollam, the scribe of the house of the Lord, saying, 2 Kings 22:4 Go up to Chelcias the high priest, and take account of the money that is brought into the house of the Lord, which they that keep the door have collected of the people. 2 Kings 22:5 And let them give it into the hand of the workmen that are appointed in the house of the Lord. And he gave it to the workmen in the house of the Lord, to repair the breaches of the house, 2 Kings 22:6 even to the carpenters, and builders, and masons, and also to purchase timber and hewn stones, to repair the breaches of the house. 2 Kings 22:7 Only they did not call them to account for the money that was given to them, because they dealt faithfully. 2 Kings 22:8 And Chelcias the high priest said to Saphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Chelcias gave the book to Sapphan, and he read it. 2 Kings 22:9 And he went into the house of the Lord to the king, and reported the matter to the king, and said, Thy servants have collected the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and have given it into the hand of the workmen that are appointed in the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 22:10 And Sapphan the scribe spoke to the king, saying, Chelcias the priest has given me a book. And Sapphan read it before the king. 2 Kings 22:11 ¶ And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his garments. 2 Kings 22:12 And the king commanded Chelcias the priest, and Achikam the son of Sapphan, and Achobor the son of Michaias, and Sapphan the scribe, and Asaias the king's servant, saying, 2 Kings 22:13 Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for all the people, and for all Juda, and concerning the words of this book that has been found: for the wrath of the Lord that has been kindled against us is great, because our fathers hearkened not to the words of this book, to do according to all the things written concerning us. 2 Kings 22:14 So Chelcias the priest went, and Achicam, and Achobor, and Sapphan, and Asaias, to Olda the prophetess, the mother of Sellem the son of Thecuan son of Aras, keeper of the robes; and she dwelt in Jerusalem in Masena; and they spoke to her. 2 Kings 22:15 And she said to them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Say to the man that sent you to me, 2 Kings 22:16 Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I bring evil upon this place, and upon them that dwell in it, even all the words of the book which the king of Juda has read: 2 Kings 22:17 because they have forsaken me, and burnt incense to other gods, that they might provoke me with the works of their hands: therefore my wrath shall burn forth against this place, and shall not be quenched. 2 Kings 22:18 And to the king of Juda that sent you to enquire of the Lord,-thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, As for the words which thou hast heard; 2 Kings 22:19 because thy heart was softened, and thou was humbled before me, when thou heardest all that I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, that it should be utterly destroyed and accursed, and thou didst rend thy garments, and weep before me; I also have heard, saith the Lord. 2 Kings 22:20 It shall not be so therefore: behold, I will add thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy tomb in peace, and thine eyes shall not see any among all the evils which I bring upon this place. 2 Kings 23:1 ¶ So they reported the word to the king: and the king sent and gathered all the elders of Juda and Jerusalem to himself. 2 Kings 23:2 And the king went up to the house of the Lord, and every man of Juda and all who dwelt in Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people small and great; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 23:3 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his ordinances with all the heart and with all the soul, to confirm the words of this covenant; even the things written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant. 2 Kings 23:4 ¶ And the king commanded Chelcias the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and them that kept the door, to bring out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and all the host of heaven, and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kedron, and took the ashes of them to Baethel. 2 Kings 23:5 And he burned the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Juda had appointed, (and they burned incense in the high places and in the cities of Juda, and the places around about Jerusalem); and them that burned incense to Baal, and to the sun, and to the moon, and to Mazuroth, and to all the host of heaven. 2 Kings 23:6 And he carried out the grove from the house of the Lord to the brook Kedron, and burned it at the brook Kedron, and reduced it to powder, and cast its powder on the sepulchres of the sons of the people. 2 Kings 23:7 And he pulled down the house of the sodomites that were by the house of the Lord, where the women wove tents for the grove. 2 Kings 23:8 And he brought up all the priest from the cities of Juda, and defiled the high places where the priests burned incense, from Gaebal even to Bersabee; and he pulled down the house of the gates that was by the door of the gate of Joshua the ruler of the city, on a man's left hand at the gate of the city. 2 Kings 23:9 Only the priests of the high places went not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem, for they only ate leavened bread in the midst of their brethren. 2 Kings 23:10 And he defiled Tapheth which is in the valley of the son of Ennom, constructed for a man to cause his son or his daughter to pass through fire to Moloch. 2 Kings 23:11 And he burned the horses which the king of Juda had given to the sun in the entrance of the house of the Lord, by the treasury of Nathan the king's eunuch, in the suburbs; and he burned the chariot of the sun with fire. 2 Kings 23:12 And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Achaz, which the kings of Juda had made, and the altars which Manasses had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord, did the king pull down and forcibly remove from thence, and cast their dust into the brook of Kedron. 2 Kings 23:13 And the king defiled the house that was before Jerusalem, on the right hand of the mount of Mosthath, which Solomon king of Israel built to Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians, and to Chamos the abomination of Moab, and to Moloch the abomination of the children of Ammon. 2 Kings 23:14 And he broke in pieces the pillars, and utterly destroyed the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men. 2 Kings 23:15 Also the high altar in Baethel, which Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that high altar he tore down, and broke in pieces the stones of it, and reduced it to powder, and burnt the grove. 2 Kings 23:16 And Josias turned aside, and saw the tombs that were there in the city, and sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burnt them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of the Lord which the man of God spoke, when Jeroboam stood by the altar at the feast: and he turned and raised his eyes to the tomb of the man of God that spoke these words. 2 Kings 23:17 And he said, What is that mound which I see? And the men of the city said to him, It is the grave of the man of God that came out of Juda, and uttered these imprecations which he imprecated upon the altar of Baethel. 2 Kings 23:18 And he said, Let him alone; let no one disturb his bones. So his bones were spared, together with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. 2 Kings 23:19 Moreover Josias removed all the houses of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel made to provoke the Lord, and did to them all that he did in Baethel. 2 Kings 23:20 And he sacrificed all the priests of the high places that were there on the altars, and burnt the bones of men upon them, and returned to Jerusalem. 2 Kings 23:21 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the Lord your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant. 2 Kings 23:22 For a passover such as this had not been kept from the days of the judges who judged Israel, even all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Juda. 2 Kings 23:23 But in the eighteenth year of king Josias, was the passover kept to the Lord in Jerusalem. 2 Kings 23:24 Moreover Josias removed the sorcerers, and the wizards, and the theraphin, and the idols, and all the abominations that had been set up in the land of Juda and in Jerusalem, that he might keep the words of the law that were written in the book, which Chelcias the priest found in the house of the Lord. 2 Kings 23:25 ¶ There was no king like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his strength, according to all the law of Moses; and after him there rose not one like him. 2 Kings 23:26 Nevertheless the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great anger, wherewith he was wroth in his anger against Juda, because of the provocations, wherewith Manasses provoked him. 2 Kings 23:27 And the Lord said, I will also remove Juda from my presence, as I removed Israel, and will reject this city which I have chosen even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there. 2 Kings 23:28 And the rest of the acts of Josias, and all that he did, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 2 Kings 23:29 And in his days went up Pharao Nechao king of Egypt against the king of the Assyrians to the river Euphrates: and Josias went out to meet him: and Nechao slew him in Mageddo when he saw him. 2 Kings 23:30 And his servants carried him dead from Mageddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre: and the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias, and anointed him, and made him king in the room of his father. 2 Kings 23:31 ¶ Twenty and three years old was Joachaz when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Amital, daughter of Jeremias of Lobna. 2 Kings 23:32 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers did. 2 Kings 23:33 And Pharao Nechao removed him to Rablaam in the land of Emath, so that he should not reign in Jerusalem; and imposed a tribute on the land, a hundred talents of silver, and a hundred talents of gold. 2 Kings 23:34 And Pharao Nechao made Eliakim son of Josias king of Juda king over them in the place of his father Josias, and he changed his name to Joakim, and he took Joachaz and brought him to Egypt, and he died there. 2 Kings 23:35 And Joakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharao; but he assessed the land to give the money at the command of Pharao: they gave the silver and the gold each man according to his assessment together with the people of the land to give to Pharao Nechao. 2 Kings 23:36 Twenty-five years old was Joakim when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jeldaph, daughter of Phadail of Ruma. 2 Kings 23:37 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the lord, according to all that his fathers had done. 2 Kings 24:1 ¶ In his days went up Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and Joakim became his servant three years; and then he turned and revolted from him. 2 Kings 24:2 And the lord sent against him the bands of the Chaldeans, and the bands of Syria, and the bans of Moab, and the bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them into the land of Juda to prevail against it, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by his servants the prophets. 2 Kings 24:3 Moreover it was the purpose of the Lord concerning Juda, to remove them from his presence, because of the sins of Manasses, according to all that he did. 2 Kings 24:4 Moreover he shed innocent blood, and filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the Lord would not pardon it. 2 Kings 24:5 And the rest of the acts of Joakim, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? 2 Kings 24:6 And Joakim slept with his fathers: and Joachim his son reigned in his stead. 2 Kings 24:7 And the king of Egypt came no more out of his land: for the king of Babylon took away all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the river of Egypt as far as the river Euphrates. 2 Kings 24:8 ¶ Eighteen years old was Joachim when he began to reign, an he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Nestha, daughter of Ellanastham, of Jerusalem. 2 Kings 24:9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father did. 2 Kings 24:10 At that time went up Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. 2 Kings 24:11 And Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants besieged it. 2 Kings 24:12 And Joachim king of Juda came forth to the king of Babylon, he and his servants, and his mother, and his princes, and his eunuchs; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. 2 Kings 24:13 And he brought forth thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and he cut up all the golden vessels which Solomon the king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord, according to the word of the Lord. 2 Kings 24:14 And he carried away the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all the captains, and the mighty men, taking captive ten thousand prisoners, and every artificer and smith: and only the poor of the land were left. 2 Kings 24:15 And he carried Joachim away to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his eunuchs: and he carried away the mighty men of the land into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. 2 Kings 24:16 And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and one thousand artificers and smiths: all were mighty men fit for war; and the king of Babylon carried them captive to Babylon. 2 Kings 24:17 And the king of Babylon made Batthanias his son king in his stead, and called his name Sedekias. 2 Kings 24:18 Twenty and one years old was Sedekias when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Amital daughter of Jeremias. 2 Kings 24:19 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Joachim did. 2 Kings 24:20 For it was according to the Lord's anger against Jerusalem and on Juda, until he cast them out of his presence, that Sedekias revolted against the king of Babylon. 2 Kings 25:1 ¶ And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, and all his host, against Jerusalem; and he encamped against it, and built a mound against it. 2 Kings 25:2 And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Sedekias on the ninth day of the month. 2 Kings 25:3 And the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land. 2 Kings 25:4 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war went forth by night, by the way of the gate between the walls, this is the gate of the king's garden: and the Chaldeans were set against the city round about: and the king went by the way of the plain. 2 Kings 25:5 And the force of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army was dispersed from about him. 2 Kings 25:6 And they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Reblatha; and he gave judgment upon him. 2 Kings 25:7 And he slew the sons of Sedekias before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Sedekias, and bound him in fetters, and brought him to Babylon. 2 Kings 25:8 ¶ And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month (this is the nineteenth year of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon), came Nabuzardan, captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem. 2 Kings 25:9 And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every house did the captain of the guard burn. 2 Kings 25:10 And the force of the Chaldeans pulled down the wall of Jerusalem round about. 2 Kings 25:11 And Nabuzardan the captain of the guard removed the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the men who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. 2 Kings 25:12 But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vine-dressers and husbandmen. 2 Kings 25:13 And the Chaldeans broke to pieces the brazen pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the Lord, and carried their brass to Babylon. 2 Kings 25:14 And the caldrons, and the shovels, and the bowls, and the censers, and all the brazen vessels with which they minister, he took. 2 Kings 25:15 And the captain of the guard took the fire-pans, and the gold and silver bowls. 2 Kings 25:16 Two pillars, and one sea, and the bases which Solomon made for the house of the Lord: there was no weight of the brass of all the vessels. 2 Kings 25:17 The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was of brass: and the height of the chapiter was three cubits: the border, and the pomegranates on the chapiter round about were all of brass: and so it was with the second pillar with its border. 2 Kings 25:18 And the captain of the guard took Saraias the high-priest, and Sophonias the second in order, and the three doorkeepers. 2 Kings 25:19 And they took out of the city one eunuch who was commander of the men of war, and five men that saw the face of the king, that were found in the city, and the secretary of the commander-in-chief, who took account of the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the city. 2 Kings 25:20 And Nabuzardan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Reblatha. 2 Kings 25:21 And the king of Babylon smote them and slew them at Reblatha in the land of Aemath. So Juda was carried away from his land. 2 Kings 25:22 ¶ And as for the people that were left in the land of Juda, whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon left, even over them he set Godolias son of Achicam son of Saphan. 2 Kings 25:23 And all the captains of the host, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had thus appointed Godolias, and they came to Godolias to Massephath, both Ismael the son of Nathanias, and Jona son of Careth, and Saraias, son of Thanamath the Netophathite, and Jezonias son of a Machathite, they and their men. 2 Kings 25:24 And Godolias swore to them and their men, and said to them, Fear not the incursion of the Chaldeans;

So he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men. 1 Chronicles 11:20 And Abisa the brother of Joab, he was chief of three: he drew his sword against three hundred slain at one time, and he had a name among the second three. 1 Chronicles 11:21 He was more famous than the two others of the three, and he was chief over them; yet he reached not to the first three. 1 Chronicles 11:22 And Banaia the son of Jodae was the son of a mighty man: many were his acts for Cabasael: he smote two lion-like men of Moab, and he went down and smote a lion in a pit on a snowy day. 1 Chronicles 11:23 And he smote an Egyptian, a wonderful man five cubits high; and in the hand of the Egyptian there was a spear like a weavers' beam; and Banaia went down to him with a staff, and took the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 1 Chronicles 11:24 These things did Banaia son of Jodae, and his name was among the three mighties. 1 Chronicles 11:25 He was distinguished beyond the thirty, yet he reached not to the first three: and David set him over his family. 1 Chronicles 11:26 And the mighty men of the forces were, Asael the brother of Joab, Eleanan the son of Dodoe of Bethleem, 1 Chronicles 11:27 Samaoth the Arorite, Chelles the Phelonite, 1 Chronicles 11:28 Ora the son of Ekkis the Thecoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, 1 Chronicles 11:29 Sobochai the Usathite, Eli the Achonite, 1 Chronicles 11:30 Marai the Netophathite, Chthaod the son of Nooza the Netophathite, 1 Chronicles 11:31 Airi the son of Rebie of the hill of Benjamin, Banaias the Pharathonite, 1 Chronicles 11:32 Uri of Nachali Gaas, Abiel the Garabaethite, 1 Chronicles 11:33 Azbon the Baromite, Eliaba the Salabonite, 1 Chronicles 11:34 the son of Asam the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Sola the Ararite, 1 Chronicles 11:35 Achim the son of Achar the Ararite, Elphat the son of Thyrophar 1 Chronicles 11:36 the Mechorathrite, Achia the Phellonite, 1 Chronicles 11:37 Esere the Charmadaite, Naarai the son of Azobai, 1 Chronicles 11:38 Joel the son of Nathan, Mebaal son of Agari, 1 Chronicles 11:39 Sele the son of Ammoni, Nachor the Berothite, armour-bearer to the son of Saruia, 1 Chronicles 11:40 Ira the Jethrite, Gaber the Jethrite, 1 Chronicles 11:41 Uria the Chettite, Zabet son of Achaia, 1 Chronicles 11:42 Adina son of Saeza, a chief of Ruben, and thirty with him, 1 Chronicles 11:43 Anan the son of Moocha, and Josaphat the Matthanite, 1 Chronicles 11:44 Ozia the Astarothite, Samatha and Jeiel sons of Chotham the Ararite, 1 Chronicles 11:45 Jediel the son of Sameri, and Jozae his brother the Thosaite, 1 Chronicles 11:46 Eliel the Maoite, and Jaribi, and Josia his son, Ellaam, and Jethama the Moabite, 1 Chronicles 11:47 Daliel, and Obeth, and Jessiel of Mesobia. 1 Chronicles 12:1 ¶ And these are they that came to Sikelag, when he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kis; and these were among the mighty, aiding him in war, 1 Chronicles 12:2 and using the bow with the right hand and with the left, and slingers with stones, and shooters with bows. Of the brethren of Saul of Benjamin, 1 Chronicles 12:3 the chief was Achiezer, and Joas son of Asma the Gabathite, and Joel and Jophalet, sons of Asmoth, and Berchia, and Jeul of Anathoth, 1 Chronicles 12:4 and Samaias the Gabaonite a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremia, and Jeziel, and Joanan, and Jozabath of Gadarathiim, 1 Chronicles 12:5 Azai and Arimuth, and Baalia, and Samaraia, and Saphatias of Charaephiel, 1 Chronicles 12:6 Helcana, and Jesuni, and Ozriel, and Jozara, and Sobocam, and the Corites, 1 Chronicles 12:7 and Jelia and Zabadia, sons of Iroam, and the men of Gedor. 1 Chronicles 12:8 And from Gad these separated themselves to David from the wilderness, strong mighty men of war, bearing shields and spears, and their faces were as the face of a lion, and they were nimble as roes upon the mountains in speed. 1 Chronicles 12:9 Aza the chief, Abdia the second, Eliab the third, 1 Chronicles 12:10 Masmana the fourth, Jeremias the fifth, 1 Chronicles 12:11 Jethi the sixth, Eliab the seventh, 1 Chronicles 12:12 Joanan the eighth, Eleazer the ninth, 1 Chronicles 12:13 Jeremia the tenth, Melchabanai the eleventh. 1 Chronicles 12:14 These were chiefs of the army of the sons of Gad, the least one commander of a hundred, and the greatest one of a thousand. 1 Chronicles 12:15 These are the men that crossed over Jordan in the first month, and it had overflowed all its banks; and they drove out all the inhabitants of the valleys, from the east to the west. 1 Chronicles 12:16 And there came some of the sons of Benjamin and Juda to the assistance of David. 1 Chronicles 12:17 And David went out to meet them, and said to them, If ye are come peaceably to me, let my heart be at peace with you: but if ye are come to betray me to my enemies unfaithfully, the God of your fathers look upon it, and reprove it. 1 Chronicles 12:18 And the Spirit came upon Amasai, a captain of the thirty, and he said, Go, David, son of Jesse, thou and thy people, peace, peace be to thee, and peace to thy helpers, for thy God has helped thee. And David received them, and made them captains of the forces. 1 Chronicles 12:19 And some came to David from Manasse, when the Philistines came against Saul to war: and he helped them not, because the captains of the Philistines took counsel, saying, With the heads of those men will he return to his master Saul. 1 Chronicles 12:20 When David was going to Sikelag, there came to him of Manasse, Edna and Jozabath, and Rodiel, and Michael, and Josabaith, and Elimuth, and Semathi: these are the captains of thousands of Manasse. 1 Chronicles 12:21 And they fought on the side of David against a troop, for they were all men of might; and they were commanders in the army, because of their might. 1 Chronicles 12:22 For daily men came to David, till they amounted to a great force, as the force of God. 1 Chronicles 12:23 ¶ And these are the names of the commanders of the army, who came to David to Chebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him according to the word of the Lord. 1 Chronicles 12:24 The sons of Juda, bearing shields and spears, six thousand and eight hundred mighty in war. 1 Chronicles 12:25 Of the sons of Symeon mighty for battle, seven thousand and a hundred. 1 Chronicles 12:26 Of the sons of Levi, four thousand and six hundred. 1 Chronicles 12:27 And Joadas the chief of the family of Aaron, and with him three thousand and seven hundred. 1 Chronicles 12:28 And Sadoc, a young man mighty in strength, and there were twenty-two leaders of his father's house. 1 Chronicles 12:29 And of the sons of Benjamin, the brethren of Saul, three thousand: and still the greater part of them kept the guard of the house of Saul. 1 Chronicles 12:30 And of the sons of Ephraim, twenty thousand and eight hundred mighty men, famous in the houses of their fathers. 1 Chronicles 12:31 And of the half-tribe of Manasse, eighteen thousand, even those who were named by name, to make David king. 1 Chronicles 12:32 And of the sons of Issachar having wisdom with regard to the times, knowing what Israel should do, two hundred;

for men have not enquired at it since the days of Saul. 1 Chronicles 13:4 And all the congregation said that they would do thus; for the saying was right in the eyes of all the people. 1 Chronicles 13:5 So David assembled all Israel, from the borders of Egypt even to the entering in of Hemath, to bring in the ark of God from the city of Jarim. 1 Chronicles 13:6 And David brought it up: and all Israel went up to the city of David, which belonged to Juda, to bring up thence the ark of the Lord God who sits between the cherubim, whose name is called on it. 1 Chronicles 13:7 And they set the ark of God on a new waggon brought out of the house of Aminadab: and Oza and his brethren drove the waggon. 1 Chronicles 13:8 And David and all Israel were playing before the Lord with all their might, and that together with singers, and with harps, and with lutes, with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. 1 Chronicles 13:9 ¶ And they came as far as the threshing-floor: and Oza put forth his hand to hold the ark, because the bullock moved it from its place. 1 Chronicles 13:10 And the Lord was very angry with Oza, and smote him there, because of his stretching forth his hand upon the ark: and he died there before God. 1 Chronicles 13:11 And David was dispirited, because the Lord had made a breach on Oza: and he called that place the Breach of Oza until this day. 1 Chronicles 13:12 And David feared God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God in to myself? 1 Chronicles 13:13 So David brought not the ark home to himself into the city of David, but he turned it aside into the house of Abeddara the Gethite. 1 Chronicles 13:14 And the ark of God abode in the house of Abeddara three months: and God blessed Abeddara and all that he had. 1 Chronicles 14:1 ¶ And Chiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar timbers, and masons, and carpenters, to build a house for him. 1 Chronicles 14:2 And David knew that the Lord had designed him to be king over Israel; because his kingdom was highly exalted, on account of his people Israel. 1 Chronicles 14:3 And David took more wives in Jerusalem: and there were born to David more sons and daughters. 1 Chronicles 14:4 And these are the names of those that were born, who were born to him in Jerusalem; Samaa, Sobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 1 Chronicles 14:5 and Baar, and Elisa, and Eliphaleth, 1 Chronicles 14:6 and Nageth, and Naphath, and Japhie, 1 Chronicles 14:7 and Elisamae, and Eliade, and Eliphala. 1 Chronicles 14:8 ¶ And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel: and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard it, and went out to meet them. 1 Chronicles 14:9 And the Philistines came and assembled together in the giants' valley. 1 Chronicles 14:10 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said to him, Go up, and I will deliver them into thy hands. 1 Chronicles 14:11 And he went up to Baal Pharasin, and David smote them there; and David said, God has broken through enemies by my hand like a breach of water: therefore he called the name of that place, the Breach of Pharasin. 1 Chronicles 14:12 And the Philistines left their gods there; and David gave orders to burn them with fire. 1 Chronicles 14:13 And the Philistines once more assembled themselves in the giants' valley. 1 Chronicles 14:14 And David enquired of God again; and God said to him, Thou shalt not go after them; turn away from them, and thou shalt come upon them near the pear trees. 1 Chronicles 14:15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear the sound of their tumult in the tops of the pear trees, then thou shalt go into the battle: for God has gone out before thee to smite the army of the Philistines. 1 Chronicles 14:16 And he did as God commanded him: and he smote the army of the Philistines from Gabaon to Gazera. 1 Chronicles 14:17 And the name of David was famous in all the land; and the Lord put the terror of him on all the nations. 1 Chronicles 15:1 ¶ And David made for himself houses in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and made a tent for it. 1 Chronicles 15:2 Then said David, It is not lawful for any to bear the ark of God, but the Levites; for the Lord has chosen them to bear the ark of the Lord, and to minister to him for ever. 1 Chronicles 15:3 And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord to the place which he had prepared for it. 1 Chronicles 15:4 And David gathered together the sons of Aaron the Levites. 1 Chronicles 15:5 Of the sons of Caath; there was Uriel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and twenty. 1 Chronicles 15:6 Of the sons of Merari; Asaia the chief, and his brethren, two hundred and twenty. 1 Chronicles 15:7 Of the sons of Gedson; Joel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and thirty. 1 Chronicles 15:8 Of the sons of Elisaphat; Semei the chief, and his brethren, two hundred. 1 Chronicles 15:9 Of the sons of Chebrom; Eliel the chief, and his brethren eighty. 1 Chronicles 15:10 Of the sons of Oziel; Aminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve. 1 Chronicles 15:11 And David called Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites, Uriel, Asaia, and Joel, and Semaia, and Eliel, and Aminadab, 1 Chronicles 15:12 and said to them, Ye are the heads of the families of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, you and your brethren, and ye shall carry up the ark of the God of Israel, to the place which I have prepared for it. 1 Chronicles 15:13 For because ye were not ready at the first, our God made a breach upon us, because we sought him not according to the ordinance. 1 Chronicles 15:14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves, to bring up the ark of the God of Israel. 1 Chronicles 15:15 And the sons of the Levites took the ark of God, (as Moses commanded by the word of God according to the scripture) upon their shoulders with staves. 1 Chronicles 15:16 And David said to the chiefs of the Levites, Set your brethren the singers with musical instruments, lutes, harps, and cymbals, to sound aloud with a voice of joy. 1 Chronicles 15:17 So the Levites appointed Aeman the son of Joel; Asaph the son of Barachias was one of his brethren; and Aethan the son of Kisaeus was of the sons of Merari their brethren; 1 Chronicles 15:18 and with them their brethren of the second rank, Zacharias, and Oziel, and Semiramoth, and Jeiel, and Elioel, and Eliab, and Banaia, and Maasaia, and Matthathia, and Eliphena, and Makellia, and Abdedom, and Jeiel, and Ozias, the porters. 1 Chronicles 15:19 And the singers, Aeman, Asaph, and Aethan, with brazen cymbals to make a sound to be heard. 1 Chronicles 15:20 Zacharias, and Oziel, Semiramoth, Jeiel, Oni, Eliab, Maasaeas, Banaeas, with lutes, on alaemoth. 1 Chronicles 15:21 And Mattathias, and Eliphalu, and Makenia, and Abdedom, and Jeiel, and Ozias, with harps of Amasenith, to make a loud noise. 1 Chronicles 15:22 And Chonenia chief of the Levites was master of the bands, because he was skilful. 1 Chronicles 15:23 And Barachia and Elcana were door-keepers of the ark. 1 Chronicles 15:24 And Somnia, and Josaphat, and Nathanael, and Amasai, and Zacharia, and Banaea, and Eliezer, the priests, were sounding with trumpets before the ark of God: and Abdedom and Jeia were door- keepers of the ark of God. 1 Chronicles 15:25 ¶ So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains of thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant from the house of Abdedom with gladness. 1 Chronicles 15:26 And it came to pass when God strengthened the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they sacrificed seven calves and seven rams. 1 Chronicles 15:27 And David was girt with a fine linen robe, and all the Levites who were bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the singers, and Chonenias the master of the band of singers; also upon David there was a robe of fine linen. 1 Chronicles 15:28 And all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of a horn, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, playing loudly on lutes and harps. 1 Chronicles 15:29 And the ark of the covenant of the Lord arrived, and came to the city of David; and Melchol the daughter of Saul looked down through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. 1 Chronicles 16:1 ¶ So they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tabernacle which David pitched for it; and they offered whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God. 1 Chronicles 16:2 And David finished offering up whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and blessed the people in the name of the Lord. 1 Chronicles 16:3 And he divided to every man of Israel (both men and women), to every man one baker's loaf, and a cake. 1 Chronicles 16:4 And he appointed before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, Levites to minister and lift up the voice, and to give thanks and praise the Lord God of Israel: 1 Chronicles 16:5 Asaph was the chief, and next to him Zacharias, Jeiel, Semiramoth, and Jeiel, Mattathias, Eliab, and Banaeas, and Abdedom: and Jeiel sounding with musical instruments, lutes and harps, and Asaph with cymbals: 1 Chronicles 16:6 and Banaeas and Oziel the priests sounding continually with trumpets before the ark of the covenant of God in that day. 1 Chronicles 16:7 ¶ Then David first gave orders to praise the Lord by the hand of Asaph and his brethren. 1 Chronicles 16:8 Song. Give thanks to the Lord, call upon him by his name, make known his designs among the people. 1 Chronicles 16:9 Sing songs to him, and sing hymns to him, relate to all people his wonderful deeds, which the Lord has wrought. 1 Chronicles 16:10 Praise his holy name, the heart that seeks his pleasure shall rejoice. 1 Chronicles 16:11 Seek the Lord and be strong, seek his face continually. 1 Chronicles 16:12 Remember his wonderful works which he has wrought, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 1 Chronicles 16:13 ye seed of Israel his servants, ye seed of Jacob his chosen ones. 1 Chronicles 16:14 He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth. 1 Chronicles 16:15 Let us remember his covenant for ever, his word which he commanded to a thousand generations, 1 Chronicles 16:16 which he covenanted with Abraham, and his oath sworn to Isaac. 1 Chronicles 16:17 He confirmed it to Jacob for an ordinance, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, 1 Chronicles 16:18 saying, To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the line of your inheritance: 1 Chronicles 16:19 when they were few in number, when they were but little, and dwelt as strangers in it; 1 Chronicles 16:20 and went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people. 1 Chronicles 16:21 He suffered not a man to oppress them, and he reproved kings for their sakes, 1 Chronicles 16:22 saying, Touch not my anointed ones, and deal not wrongfully with my prophets. 1 Chronicles 16:23 Sing ye to the Lord, all the earth; proclaim his salvation from day to day. 1 Chronicles 16:24 Declare among the nations his glory, his wondrous deeds among all peoples. 1 Chronicles 16:25 For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 1 Chronicles 16:26 For all the gods of the nations are idols; but our God made the heavens. 1 Chronicles 16:27 Glory and praise are in his presence; strength and rejoicing are in his place. 1 Chronicles 16:28 Give to the Lord, ye families of the nations, give to the Lord glory and strength. 1 Chronicles 16:29 Give to the Lord the glory belonging to his name: take gifts and offer them before him; and worship the Lord in his holy courts. 1 Chronicles 16:30 Let the whole earth fear before him; let the earth be established, and not be moved. 1 Chronicles 16:31 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth exult; and let them say among the nations, The Lord reigns. 1 Chronicles 16:32 The sea with its fullness shall resound and the tree of the field, and all things in it. 1 Chronicles 16:33 Then shall the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord, for he is come to judge the earth. 1 Chronicles 16:34 Give thanks to the Lord, for it is good, for his mercy is for ever. 1 Chronicles 16:35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us, and rescue us from among the heathen, that we may praise thy holy name, and glory in thy praises. 1 Chronicles 16:36 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting: And all the people shall say, Amen. So they praised the Lord. 1 Chronicles 16:37 ¶ And they left there Asaph and his brethren before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to minister before the ark continually, according to the service of each day: from day to day. 1 Chronicles 16:38 And Abdedom and his brethren were sixty and eight; and Abdedom the son of Idithun, and Osa, were to be door-keepers. 1 Chronicles 16:39 And they appointed Sadoc the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place in Gabaon, 1 Chronicles 16:40 to offer up whole-burnt-offerings continually morning and evening, and according to all things written in the law of the Lord, which he commanded the children of Israel by Moses the servant of God. 1 Chronicles 16:41 And with him were Aeman and Idithun, and the rest chosen out by name to praise the Lord, for his mercy endures for ever. 1 Chronicles 16:42 And with them there were trumpets and cymbals to sound aloud, and musical instruments for the songs of God: and the sons of Idithun were at the gate. 1 Chronicles 16:43 And all the people went every one to his home: and David returned to bless his house. 1 Chronicles 17:1 ¶ And it came to pass as David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under curtains of skins. 1 Chronicles 17:2 And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee. 1 Chronicles 17:3 And it came to pass in that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying, 1 Chronicles 17:4 Go and say to David my servant, Thus said the Lord, Thou shalt not build me a house for me to dwell in it. 1 Chronicles 17:5 For I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought up Israel until this day, but I have been in a tabernacle and a tent, 1 Chronicles 17:6 in all places through which I have gone with all Israel: did I ever speak to any one tribe of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why is it that ye have not built me a house of cedar? 1 Chronicles 17:7 And now thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, I took thee from the sheepfold, from following the flocks, to be a ruler over my people Israel: 1 Chronicles 17:8 and I was with thee in all places whither thou wentest, and I destroyed all thine enemies from before thee, and I made for thee a name according to the name of the great ones that are upon the earth. 1 Chronicles 17:9 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant him, and he shall dwell by himself, and shall no longer be anxious; and the son of iniquity shall no longer afflict him, as at the beginning, 1 Chronicles 17:10 and from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel. Also I have humbled all thine enemies, and I will increase thee, and the Lord will build thee a house. 1 Chronicles 17:11 And it shall come to pass when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 1 Chronicles 17:12 He shall build me a house, and I will set up his throne for ever. 1 Chronicles 17:13 I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and my mercy will I not withdraw from him, as I withdrew it from them that were before thee. 1 Chronicles 17:14 And I will establish him in my house and in his kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be set up for ever. 1 Chronicles 17:15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so spoke Nathan to David. 1 Chronicles 17:16 ¶ And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God? and what is my house, that thou hast loved me for ever? 1 Chronicles 17:17 And these things were little in thy sight, O God: thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for a long time to come, and thou hast looked upon me as a man looks upon his fellow, and hast exalted me, O Lord God. 1 Chronicles 17:18 What shall David do more toward thee to glorify thee? and thou knowest thy servant. 1 Chronicles 17:19 And thou hast wrought all this greatness according to thine heart. 1 Chronicles 17:20 O Lord, there is none like thee, and there is no God beside thee, according to all things which we have heard with our ears. 1 Chronicles 17:21 Neither is there another nation upon the earth such as thy people Israel, whereas God led him in the way, to redeem a people for himself, to make for himself a great and glorious name, to cast out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemedst out of Egypt. 1 Chronicles 17:22 And thou hast appointed thy people Israel as a people to thyself for ever; and thou, Lord, didst become a God to them. 1 Chronicles 17:23 And now, Lord, let the word which thou spokest to thy servant, and concerning his house, be confirmed for ever, and do thou as thou hast spoken. 1 Chronicles 17:24 And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, men saying, Lord, Lord, Almighty God of Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee. 1 Chronicles 17:25 For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant that thou wilt build him a house; therefore thy servant has found a willingness to pray before thee. 1 Chronicles 17:26 And now, Lord, thou thyself art God, and thou hast spoken these good things concerning thy servant. 1 Chronicles 17:27 And now thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, so that it should continue for ever before thee: for thou, Lord, hast blessed it, and do thou bless it for ever. 1 Chronicles 18:1 ¶ And it came to pass afterwards, that David smote the Philistines, and routed them, and took Geth and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines. 1 Chronicles 18:2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and tributaries. 1 Chronicles 18:3 And David smote Adraazar king of Suba of Emath, as he was going to establish power toward the river Euphrates. 1 Chronicles 18:4 And David took of them a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand infantry: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but there were reserved of them a hundred chariots. 1 Chronicles 18:5 And the Syrian came from Damascus to help Adraazar king of Suba; and David smote of the Syrian army twenty and two thousand men. 1 Chronicles 18:6 And David put a garrison in Syria near Damascus; and they became tributary servants to David: and the Lord delivered David wherever he went. 1 Chronicles 18:7 And David took the golden collars that were on the servants of Adraazar, and brought them to Jerusalem. 1 Chronicles 18:8 And David took out of Matabeth, and out of the chief cities of Adraazar very much brass: of this Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the brazen vessels. 1 Chronicles 18:9 ¶ And Thoa king of Emath heard that David had smitten the whole force of Adraazar king of Suba. 1 Chronicles 18:10 And he sent Aduram his son to king David to ask how he was, and to congratulate him because he had fought against Adraazar, and smitten him; for Thoa was the enemy of Adraazar. 1 Chronicles 18:11 And all the golden and silver and brazen vessels, even these king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and the gold which he took from all the nations; from Idumaea, and Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalec. 1 Chronicles 18:12 And Abesa son of Saruia smote the Idumeans in the valley of Salt, eighteen thousand. 1 Chronicles 18:13 And he put garrisons in the valley; and all the Idumaeans became David's servants: and the Lord delivered David wherever he went. 1 Chronicles 18:14 So David reigned over all Israel; and he executed judgment and justice to all his people. 1 Chronicles 18:15 And Joab the son of Saruia was over the army, and Josaphat the son of Achilud was recorder. 1 Chronicles 18:16 And Sadoc son of Achitob, and Achimelech son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Susa was the scribe; 1 Chronicles 18:17 and Banaeas the son of Jodae was over the Cherethite and the Phelethite, and the sons of David were the chief deputies of the king. 1 Chronicles 19:1 ¶ And it came to pass after this, that Naas the king of the children of Ammon died, and Anan his son reigned in his stead. 1 Chronicles 19:2 And David said, I will act kindly toward Anan the son of Naas, as his father acted kindly towards me. And David sent messengers to condole with him on the death of his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Anan, to comfort him. 1 Chronicles 19:3 And the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Anan, Is it to honour thy father before thee, that David has sent comforters to thee? Have not his servants come to thee that they might search the city, and to spy out the land? 1 Chronicles 19:4 And Anan took the servants of David, and shaved them, and cut off the half of their garments as far as their tunic, and sent them away. 1 Chronicles 19:5 And there came men to report to David concerning the men: and he sent to meet them, for they were greatly disgraced: and the king said, Dwell in Jericho until your beards have grown, and return. 1 Chronicles 19:6 ¶ And the children of Ammon saw that the people of David were ashamed, and Anan and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen out of Syria of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria Maacha, and from Sobal. 1 Chronicles 19:7 And they hired for themselves two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maacha and his people; and they came and encamped before Medaba: and the children of Ammon assembled out of their cities, and came to fight. 1 Chronicles 19:8 And David heard, and sent Joab and all the host of mighty men. 1 Chronicles 19:9 And the children of Ammon came forth, and set themselves in array for battle by the gate of the city: and the kings that were come forth encamped by themselves in the plain. 1 Chronicles 19:10 And Joab saw that they were fronting him to fight against him before and behind, and he chose some out of all the young men of Israel, and they set themselves in array against the Syrian. 1 Chronicles 19:11 And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of his brother Abesai, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon. 1 Chronicles 19:12 And he said, If the Syrian should prevail against me, then shalt thou deliver me: and if the children of Ammon should prevail against thee, then will I deliver thee. 1 Chronicles 19:13 Be of good courage, and let us be strong, for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the Lord shall do what is good in his eyes. 1 Chronicles 19:14 So Joab and the people that were with him set themselves in battle array against the Syrians, and they fled from them. 1 Chronicles 19:15 And the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled, and they also fled from before Abesai, and from before Joab his brother, and they came to the city: and Joab came to Jerusalem. 1 Chronicles 19:16 And the Syrian saw that Israel had defeated him, and he sent messengers, and they brought out the Syrians from beyond the river; and Sophath the commander-in-chief of the forces of Adraazar was before them. 1 Chronicles 19:17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and crossed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So David set his army in array to fight against the Syrians, and they fought against him. 1 Chronicles 19:18 And the Syrians fled from before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand riders in chariots, and forty thousand infantry, and he slew Sophath the commander-in-chief of the forces. 1 Chronicles 19:19 And the servants of Adraazar saw that they were defeated before Israel, and they made peace with David and served him: and the Syrians would not any more help the children of Ammon. 1 Chronicles 20:1 ¶ And it came to pass at the return of the year, at the time of the going forth of kings to war, that Joab gathered the whole force of the army, and they ravaged the land of the children of Ammon; and he came and besieged Rabba. But David abode in Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabba and destroyed it. 1 Chronicles 20:2 And David took the crown of Molchom their king off his head, and the weight of it was found to be a talent of gold, and on it were precious stones; and it was placed on the head of David: and he brought out the spoils of the city which were very great. 1 Chronicles 20:3 And he brought out the people that were in it, and sawed them asunder with saws, and cut them with iron axes, and with harrows: and thus David did to all the children of Ammon. And David and all his people returned to Jerusalem. 1 Chronicles 20:4 ¶ And it came to pass afterward that there was again war with the Philistines in Gazer: then Sobochai the Sosathite smote Saphut of the sons of the giants, and laid him low. 1 Chronicles 20:5 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Eleanan the son of Jair smote Lachmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, and the wood of his spear was as a weavers' beam. 1 Chronicles 20:6 And there was again war in Geth, and there was a man of extraordinary size, and his fingers and toes were six on each hand and foot, four and twenty; and he was descended from the giants. 1 Chronicles 20:7 And he defied Israel, and Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of David slew him. 1 Chronicles 20:8 These were born to Rapha in Geth; all four were giants, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. 1 Chronicles 21:1 ¶ And the devil stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel. 1 Chronicles 21:2 And king David said to Joab and to the captains of the forces, Go, number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and bring me the account, and I shall know their number. 1 Chronicles 21:3 And Joab said, May the Lord add to his people, a hundred-fold as many as they are, and let the eyes of my lord the king see it: all are the servants of my lord. Why does my lord seek this thing? do it not, lest it become a sin to Israel. 1 Chronicles 21:4 Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab; and Joab went out and passed through all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. 1 Chronicles 21:5 And Joab gave the number of the mustering of the people to David: and all Israel was a million and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and the sons of Juda were four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew sword. 1 Chronicles 21:6 But he numbered not Levi and Benjamin among them; for the word of the king was painful to Joab. 1 Chronicles 21:7 ¶ And there was evil in the sight of the Lord respecting this thing; and he smote Israel. 1 Chronicles 21:8 And David said to God, I have sinned exceedingly, in that I have done this thing: and now, I pray thee, remove the sin of thy servant; for I have been exceedingly foolish. 1 Chronicles 21:9 And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer, saying, 1 Chronicles 21:10 Go and speak to David, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I bring three things upon thee: choose one of them for thyself, and I will do it to thee. 1 Chronicles 21:11 And Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Choose for thyself, 1 Chronicles 21:12 either three years of famine, or that thou shouldest flee three months from the face of thine enemies, and the sword of thine enemies shall be employed to destroy thee, or that the sword of the Lord and pestilence should be three days in the land, and the angel of the Lord shall be destroying in all the inheritance of Israel. And now consider what I shall answer to him that sent the message. 1 Chronicles 21:13 And David said to Gad, They are very hard for me, even all the three: let me fall now into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are very abundant, and let me not fall by any means into the hands of man. 1 Chronicles 21:14 So the Lord brought pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. 1 Chronicles 21:15 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the Lord saw, and repented for the evil, and said to the angel that was destroying, Let it suffice thee; withhold thine hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite. 1 Chronicles 21:16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord, standing between the earth and the heaven, and his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem: and David and the elders clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. 1 Chronicles 21:17 And David said to God, Was it not I that gave orders to number the people? and I am the guilty one; I have greatly sinned: but these sheep, what have they done? O Lord God, let thy hand be upon me, and upon my father's house, and not on thy people for destruction, O Lord! 1 Chronicles 21:18 ¶ And the angel of the Lord told Gad to tell David, that he should go up to erect and altar to the Lord, in the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite. 1 Chronicles 21:19 And David went up according to the word of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the Lord. 1 Chronicles 21:20 And Orna turned and saw the king; and he hid himself and his four sons with him. Now Orna was threshing wheat. 1 Chronicles 21:21 And David came to Orna; and Orna came forth from the threshing-floor, and did obeisance to David with his face to the ground. 1 Chronicles 21:22 And David said to Orna, Give me thy place of the threshing-floor, and I will build upon it an altar to the Lord: give it me for its worth in money, and the plague shall cease from among the people. 1 Chronicles 21:23 And Orna said to David, Take it to thyself, and let my lord the king do what is right in his eyes: see, I have given the calves for a whole-burnt-offering, and the plough for wood, and the corn for a meat-offering; I have given all. 1 Chronicles 21:24 And king David said to Orna, Nay; for I will surely buy it for its worth in money: for I will not take thy property for the Lord, to offer a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord without cost to myself. 1 Chronicles 21:25 And David gave to Orna for his place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. 1 Chronicles 21:26 And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered up whole-burnt-offerings and peace- offerings: and he cried to the Lord, and he answered him by fire out of heaven on the altar of whole-burnt-offerings, and it consumed the whole-burnt-offering. 1 Chronicles 21:27 And the Lord spoke to the angel; and he put up the sword into its sheath. 1 Chronicles 21:28 At that time when David saw that the Lord answered him in the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite, he also sacrificed there. 1 Chronicles 21:29 And the tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of whole-burnt- offerings, were at that time in the high place at Gabaon. 1 Chronicles 21:30 And David could not go before it to enquire of God; for he hasted not because of the sword of the angel of the Lord. 1 Chronicles 22:1 ¶ And David said, This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar for whole-burnt-offering for Israel. 1 Chronicles 22:2 And David gave orders to gather all the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he appointed stone-hewers to hew polished stones to build the house to God. 1 Chronicles 22:3 And David prepared much iron for the nails of the doors and the gate; the hinges also and brass in abundance, there was no weighing of it. 1 Chronicles 22:4 And cedar threes without number: for the Sidonians and the Tyrians brought cedar trees in abundance to David. 1 Chronicles 22:5 And David said, My son Solomon is a tender child, and the house for me to build to the Lord is for superior magnificence for a name and for a glory through all the earth: I will make preparation for it. And David prepared abundantly before his death. 1 Chronicles 22:6 ¶ And he called Solomon his son, and commanded him to build the house for the Lord God of Israel. 1 Chronicles 22:7 And David said to Solomon, My child, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of the Lord God. 1 Chronicles 22:8 But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast carried on great wars: thou shalt not build a house to my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth before me. 1 Chronicles 22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, he shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. 1 Chronicles 22:10 He shall build a house to my name; and he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom in Israel for ever. 1 Chronicles 22:11 And now, my son, the Lord shall be with thee, and prosper thee; and thou shalt build a house to the Lord thy God, as he spoke concerning thee. 1 Chronicles 22:12 Only may the Lord give thee wisdom and prudence, and strengthen thee over Israel, both to keep and to do the law of the Lord thy God. 1 Chronicles 22:13 Then will he prosper thee, if thou take heed to do the commandments and judgments which the Lord commanded Moses for Israel: be courageous and strong; fear not, nor be terrified. 1 Chronicles 22:14 And, behold, I according to my poverty have prepared for the house of the Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a million talents of silver, and brass and iron without measure; for it is abundant; and I have prepared timber and stones; and do thou add to these. 1 Chronicles 22:15 And of them that are with thee do thou add to the multitude of workmen; let there be artificers and masons, and carpenters, and every skilful workman in every work; 1 Chronicles 22:16 in gold and silver, brass and iron, of which there is no number. Arise and do, and the Lord be with thee. 1 Chronicles 22:17 ¶ And David charged all the chief men of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, 1 Chronicles 22:18 Is not the Lord with you? and he has given you rest round about, for he has given into your hands the inhabitants of the land; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people. 1 Chronicles 22:19 Now set your hearts and souls to seek after the Lord your God: and rise, and build a sanctuary to your God to carry in the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the Lord. 1 Chronicles 23:1 ¶ And David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel in his stead. 1 Chronicles 23:2 And he assembled all the chief men of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites. 1 Chronicles 23:3 And the Levites numbered themselves from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls amounted to thirty and eight thousand men. 1 Chronicles 23:4 Of the overseers over the works of the house of the Lord there were twenty-four thousand, and there were six thousand scribes and judges; 1 Chronicles 23:5 and four thousand door-keepers, and four thousand to praise the Lord with instruments which he made to praise the Lord. 1 Chronicles 23:6 And David divided them into daily courses, for the sons of Levi, for Gedson, Caath, and Merari. 1 Chronicles 23:7 And for the family of Gedson, Edan, and Semei. 1 Chronicles 23:8 The sons of Edan were Jeiel, the chief, and Zethan, and Joel, three. 1 Chronicles 23:9 The sons of Semei; Salomith, Jeiel, and Dan, three: these were the chiefs of the families of Edan. 1 Chronicles 23:10 And to the sons of Semei, Jeth, and Ziza, and Joas, and Beria: these were the four sons of Semei. 1 Chronicles 23:11 And Jeth was the chief, and Ziza the second: and Joas and Beria did not multiply sons, and they became only one reckoning according to the house of their father. 1 Chronicles 23:12 The sons of Caath; Ambram, Isaar, Chebron, Oziel, four. 1 Chronicles 23:13 The sons of Ambram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was appointed for the consecration of the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister and bless in his name for ever. 1 Chronicles 23:14 And as for Moses the man of God, his sons were reckoned to the tribe of Levi. 1 Chronicles 23:15 The sons of Moses; Gersam, and Eliezer. 1 Chronicles 23:16 The sons of Gersam; Subael the chief. 1 Chronicles 23:17 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rabia the chief: and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rabia were very greatly multiplied. 1 Chronicles 23:18 The sons of Isaar; Salomoth the chief. 1 Chronicles 23:19 The sons of Chebron; Jeria the chief, Amaria the second, Jeziel the third, Jekemias the fourth. 1 Chronicles 23:20 The sons of Oziel; Micha the chief, and Isia the second. 1 Chronicles 23:21 The sons of Merari; Mooli, and Musi: the sons of Mooli; Eleazar, and Kis. 1 Chronicles 23:22 And Eleazar died, and he had no sons, but daughters: and the sons of Kis, their brethren, took them. 1 Chronicles 23:23 The sons of Musi; Mooli, and Eder, and Jarimoth, three. 1 Chronicles 23:24 ¶ These are the sons of Levi according to the houses of their fathers; chiefs of their families according to their numbering, according to the number of their names, according to their polls, doing the works of service of the house of the Lord, from twenty years old and upward. 1 Chronicles 23:25 For David said, The Lord God of Israel has given rest to his people, and has taken up his abode in Jerusalem for ever. 1 Chronicles 23:26 And the Levites bore not the tabernacle, and all the vessels of it for its service. 1 Chronicles 23:27 For by the last words of David was the number of the Levites taken from twenty years old and upward. 1 Chronicles 23:28 For he appointed them to wait on Aaron, to minister in the house of the Lord, over the courts, and over the chambers, and over the purification of all the holy things, and over the works of the service of the house of God; 1 Chronicles 23:29 and for the shew-bread, and for the fine flour of the meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for the fried cake, and for the dough, and for every measure; 1 Chronicles 23:30 and to stand in the morning to praise and give thanks to the Lord, and so in the evening; 1 Chronicles 23:31 and to be over all the whole-burnt-offerings that were offered up to the Lord on the sabbaths, and at the new moons, and at the feasts, by number, according to the order given to them, continually before the Lord. 1 Chronicles 23:32 And they are to keep the charge of the tabernacle of witness, and the charge of the holy place, and the charges of the sons of Aaron their brethren, to minister in the house of the Lord. 1 Chronicles 24:1 ¶ And they number the sons of Aaron in their division, Nadab, and Abiud, and Eleazar, and Ithamar. 1 Chronicles 24:2 And Nadab and Abiud died before their father, and they had no sons: so Eleazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron ministered as priests. 1 Chronicles 24:3 And David distributed them, even Sadoc of the sons of Eleazar, and Achimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their numbering, according to their service, according to the houses of their fathers. 1 Chronicles 24:4 And there were found among the sons of Eleazar more chiefs of the mighty ones, than of the sons of Ithamar: and he divided them, sixteen heads of families to the sons of Eleazar, eight according to their families to the sons of Ithamar. 1 Chronicles 24:5 And he divided them according to their lots, one with the other; for there were those who had charge of the holy things, and those who had charge of the house of the Lord among the sons of Eleazar, and among the sons of Ithamar. 1 Chronicles 24:6 And Samaias the son of Nathanael, the scribe, of the family of Levi, wrote them down before the king, and the princes, and Sadoc the priest, and Achimelech the son of Abiathar were present; and the heads of the families of the priests and the Levites, each of a household were assigned one to Eleazar, and one to Ithamar. 1 Chronicles 24:7 And the first lot came out to Joarim, the second to Jedia, 1 Chronicles 24:8 the third to Charib, the fourth to Seorim, 1 Chronicles 24:9 the fifth to Melchias, the sixth to Meiamin, 1 Chronicles 24:10 the seventh to Cos, the eighth to Abia, 1 Chronicles 24:11 the ninth to Jesus, the tenth to Sechenias, 1 Chronicles 24:12 the eleventh to Eliabi, the twelfth to Jacim, 1 Chronicles 24:13 the thirteenth to Oppha, the fourteenth to Jesbaal, 1 Chronicles 24:14 the fifteenth to Belga, the sixteenth to Emmer, 1 Chronicles 24:15 the seventeenth to Chezin, the eighteenth to Aphese, 1 Chronicles 24:16 the nineteenth to Phetaea, the twentieth to Ezekel, 1 Chronicles 24:17 the twenty-first to Achim, the twenty-second to Gamul, 1 Chronicles 24:18 the twenty-third to Adallai, the twenty-fourth to Maasai. 1 Chronicles 24:19 This is their numbering according to their service to go into the house of the Lord, according to their appointment by the hand of Aaron their father, as the Lord God of Israel commanded. 1 Chronicles 24:20 ¶ And for the sons of Levi that were left, even for the sons of Ambram, Sobael: for the sons of Sobael, Jedia. 1 Chronicles 24:21 For Raabia, the chief was Isaari, 1 Chronicles 24:22 and for Isaari, Salomoth: for the sons of Salomoth, Jath. 1 Chronicles 24:23 The sons of Ecdiu; Amadia the second, Jaziel the third, Jecmoam the fourth. 1 Chronicles 24:24 For the sons of Oziel, Micha: the sons of Micha; Samer. 1 Chronicles 24:25 The brother of Micha; Isia, the son of Isia; Zacharia. 1 Chronicles 24:26 The sons of Merari, Mooli, and Musi: the sons of Ozia, 1 Chronicles 24:27 That is, the sons of Merari by Ozia,-his sons were Isoam, and Sacchur, and Abai. 1 Chronicles 24:28 To Mooli were born Eleazar, and Ithamar;

And who is willing to dedicate himself in work this day for the Lord? 1 Chronicles 29:6 Then the heads of families, and the princes of the children of Israel, and the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and the overseers of the works, and the king's builders, offered willingly. 1 Chronicles 29:7 And they gave for the works of the house of the Lord five thousand talents of gold, and ten thousand gold pieces, and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of brass, and a hundred thousand talents of iron. 1 Chronicles 29:8 And they who had precious stone, gave it into the treasuries of the house of the Lord by the hand of Jeiel the Gedsonite. 1 Chronicles 29:9 And the people rejoiced because of the willingness, for they offered willingly to the Lord with a full heart: and king David rejoiced greatly. 1 Chronicles 29:10 ¶ And king David blessed the Lord before the congregation, saying, Blessed art thou, O Lord God of Israel, our Father, from everlasting and to everlasting. 1 Chronicles 29:11 Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the might: for thou art Lord of all things that are in heaven and upon the earth: before thy face every king and nation is troubled. 1 Chronicles 29:12 From thee come wealth and glory: thou, O Lord, rulest over all, the Lord of all dominion, and in thy hand is strength and rule; and thou art almighty with thy hand to increase and establish all things. 1 Chronicles 29:13 And now, Lord, we give thanks to thee, and praise thy glorious name. 1 Chronicles 29:14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we have been able to be thus forward in offering to thee? for all things are thine, and of thine own have we given thee, 1 Chronicles 29:15 for we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days upon the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining. 1 Chronicles 29:16 O Lord our God, as for all this abundance which I have prepared that a house should be built to thy holy name, it is of thy hand, and all is thine. 1 Chronicles 29:17 And I know, Lord, that thou art he that searches the hearts, and thou lovest righteousness. I have willingly offered all these things in simplicity of heart; and now I have seen with joy thy people here present, willingly offering to thee. 1 Chronicles 29:18 O Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, preserve these things in the thought of the heart of thy people for ever, and direct their hearts to thee. 1 Chronicles 29:19 And to Solomon my son give a good heart, to perform thy commandments, and to observe thy testimonies, and thine ordinances, and to accomplish the building of thy house. 1 Chronicles 29:20 And David said to the whole congregation, Bless ye the Lord our God. And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and they bowed the knee and worshipped the Lord, and did obeisance to the king. 1 Chronicles 29:21 And David sacrificed to the Lord, and offered up whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord on the morrow after the first day, a thousand calves, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, and their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. 1 Chronicles 29:22 And they ate and drank joyfully that day before the Lord: and they made Solomon the son of David king a second time, and anointed him king before the Lord, and Sadoc to the priesthood. 1 Chronicles 29:23 ¶ And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and was highly honoured; and all Israel obeyed him. 1 Chronicles 29:24 The princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons of king David his father, were subject to him. 1 Chronicles 29:25 And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel, and gave him royal glory, such as was not upon any king before him. 1 Chronicles 29:26 And David the son of Jessae reigned over Israel forty years; 1 Chronicles 29:27 seven years in Chebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 1 Chronicles 29:28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, in wealth, and glory: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 1 Chronicles 29:29 And the rest of the acts of David, the former and the latter, are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer, 1 Chronicles 29:30 concerning all his reign, and his power, and the times which went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the earth. 2 Chronicles 1:1 ¶ And Solomon the son of David was established over his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and increased him exceedingly. 2 Chronicles 1:2 And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands, and to the captains of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the rulers over Israel, even the heads of the families; 2 Chronicles 1:3 and Solomon and all the congregation went to the high place that was in Gabaon, where was God's tabernacle of witness, which Moses the servant of the Lord made in the wilderness. 2 Chronicles 1:4 But David had brought up the ark of God out of the city of Cariathiarim; for David had prepared a place for it, for he had pitched a tabernacle for it in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 1:5 And the brazen altar which Beseleel the son of Urias, the son of Or, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon and the congregation enquired at it. 2 Chronicles 1:6 And Solomon brought victims thither to the brazen altar that was before the Lord in the tabernacle, and offered upon it a thousand whole-burnt-offerings. 2 Chronicles 1:7 In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give thee. 2 Chronicles 1:8 And Solomon said to God, Thou hast dealt very mercifully with my father David, and hast made me king in his stead. 2 Chronicles 1:9 And now, O Lord God, let, I pray thee, thy name be established upon David my father; for thou hast made me king over a people numerous as the dust of the earth. 2 Chronicles 1:10 Now give me wisdom and understanding, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who shall judge this thy great people? 2 Chronicles 1:11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked great wealth, nor glory, nor the life of thine enemies, and thou hast not asked long life; but hast asked for thyself wisdom and understanding, that thou mightest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king: 2 Chronicles 1:12 I give thee this wisdom and understanding; and I will give thee wealth, and riches, and glory, so that there shall not have been any like thee among the kings before thee, neither shall there be such after thee. 2 Chronicles 1:13 ¶ And Solomon came from the high place that was in Gabaon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of witness, and reigned over Israel. 2 Chronicles 1:14 And Solomon collected chariots and horsemen: and he had fourteen hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he set them in the cities of chariots, and the people were with the king in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 1:15 And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem to be as stones, and cedars in Judea as sycamores in the plain for multitude. 2 Chronicles 1:16 And Solomon imported horses from Egypt, and the charge of the king's merchants for going was as follows, and they traded, 2 Chronicles 1:17 and went and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty pieces of silver: and so they brought for all the kings of the Chettites, and for the kings of Syria by their means. 2 Chronicles 2:1 ¶ And Solomon said that he would build a house to the name of the Lord, and a house for his kingdom. 2 Chronicles 2:2 And Solomon gathered seventy thousand men that bore burdens, and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the mountain, and there were three thousand six hundred superintendents over them. 2 Chronicles 2:3 And Solomon sent to Chiram king of Tyre, saying, Whereas thou didst deal favourably with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build for himself a house to dwell in, 2 Chronicles 2:4 behold, I also his son am building a house to the name of the Lord my God, to consecrate it to him, to burn incense before him, and to offer shewbread continually, and to offer up whole-burnt- offerings continually morning and evening, and on the sabbaths, and at the new moons, and at the feasts of the Lord our God: this is a perpetual statute for Israel. 2 Chronicles 2:5 And the house which I am building is to be great: for the Lord our God is great beyond all gods. 2 Chronicles 2:6 And who will be able to build him a house? for the heaven and heaven of heavens do not bear his glory: and who am I, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him? 2 Chronicles 2:7 And now send me a man wise and skilled to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in blue, and one that knows how to grave together with the craftsmen who are with me in Juda and in Jerusalem, which materials my father David prepared. 2 Chronicles 2:8 And send me from Libanus cedar wood, and wood of juniper, and pine; for I know that thy servants are skilled in cutting timber in Libanus: and, behold, thy servants shall go with my servants, 2 Chronicles 2:9 to prepare timber for me in abundance: for the house which I am building must be great and glorious. 2 Chronicles 2:10 And, behold, I have given freely to thy servants that work and cut the wood, corn for food, even twenty thousand measures of wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, and twenty thousand measures of oil. 2 Chronicles 2:11 ¶ And Chiram king of Tyre answered in writing, and sent to Solomon, saying, Because the Lord loved his people, he made thee king over them. 2 Chronicles 2:12 And Chiram said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given to king David a wise son, and one endowed with knowledge and understanding, who shall build a house for the Lord, and a house for his kingdom. 2 Chronicles 2:13 And now I have sent thee a wise and understanding man who belonged to Chiram my father 2 Chronicles 2:14 (his mother was of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a Tyrian), skilled to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in stones and wood; and to weave with purple, and blue, and fine linen, and scarlet; and to engrave, and to understand every device, whatsoever thou shalt give him to do with thy craftsmen, and the craftsmen of my lord David thy father. 2 Chronicles 2:15 And now, the wheat, and the barley, and the oil, and the wine which my lord mentioned, let him send to his servants. 2 Chronicles 2:16 And we will cut timber out of Libanus according to all thy need, and we will bring it on rafts to the sea of Joppa, and thou shalt bring it to Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 2:17 And Solomon gathered all the foreigners that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father numbered them; and there were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred. 2 Chronicles 2:18 And he made of them seventy thousand burden-bearers, and eighty thousand hewers of stone, and three thousand six hundred taskmasters over the people. 2 Chronicles 3:1 ¶ And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem in the mount of Amoria, where the Lord appeared to his father David, in the place which David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite. 2 Chronicles 3:2 And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. 2 Chronicles 3:3 And thus Solomon began to build the house of God: the length in cubits-even the first measurement from end to end, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. 2 Chronicles 3:4 And the portico in front of the house, its length in front of the breadth of the house was twenty cubits, and its height a hundred and twenty cubits: and he gilded it within with pure gold. 2 Chronicles 3:5 And he lined the great house with cedar wood, and gilded it with pure gold, and carved upon it palm-trees and chains. 2 Chronicles 3:6 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty; and he gilded it with gold of the gold from Pharuim. 2 Chronicles 3:7 And he gilded the house, and its inner walls, and the door-posts, and the roofs, and the doors with gold; and he carved cherubs on the walls. 2 Chronicles 3:8 And he built the holy of holies, its length was according to the front of the other house, the breadth of the house was twenty cubits, and the length twenty cubits: and he gilded it with pure gold for cherubs, to the amount of six hundred talents. 2 Chronicles 3:9 And the weight of the nails, even the weight of each was fifty shekels of gold: and he gilded the upper chamber with gold. 2 Chronicles 3:10 ¶ And he made two cherubs in the most holy house, wood-work, and he gilded them with gold. 2 Chronicles 3:11 And the wings of the cherubs were twenty cubits in length: and one wing of five cubits touched the wall of the house: and the other wing of five cubits touched the wing of the other cherub. 2 Chronicles 3:12 2 Chronicles 3:13 And the wings of these cherubs expanded were of the length of twenty cubits: and they stood upon their feet, and their faces were toward the house. 2 Chronicles 3:14 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and wove cherubs in it. 2 Chronicles 3:15 Also he made in front of the house two pillars, in height thirty-five cubits, and their chapters of five cubits. 2 Chronicles 3:16 And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains. 2 Chronicles 3:17 And he set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left: and he called the name of the one on the right hand 'Stability,' and the name of the one on the left 'Strength.' 2 Chronicles 4:1 ¶ And he made a brazen altar, the length of it twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, and the height ten cubits. 2 Chronicles 4:2 And he made the molten sea, in diameter ten cubits, entirely round, and the height of it five cubits, and the circumference thirty cubits. 2 Chronicles 4:3 And beneath it the likeness of calves, they compass it round about: ten cubits compass the laver round about, they cast the calves two rows in their casting, 2 Chronicles 4:4 wherein they made them twelve calves,-three looking northwards, and three westwards, and three southwards, and three eastwards: and the sea was upon them above, and their hinder parts were inward. 2 Chronicles 4:5 And its thickness was a hand-breadth, and its brim as the brim of a cup, graven with flowers of lilies, holding three thousand measures: and he finished it. 2 Chronicles 4:6 And he made ten lavers, and set five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them the instruments of the whole-burnt-offerings, and to rinse the vessels in them; and the sea was for the priests to wash in. 2 Chronicles 4:7 And he made the ten golden candlesticks according to their pattern, and he put them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. 2 Chronicles 4:8 And he made ten tables, and put them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left: and he made a hundred golden bowls. 2 Chronicles 4:9 Also he made the priests' court, and the great court, and doors to the court, and their panels were overlaid with brass. 2 Chronicles 4:10 And he set the sea at the corner of the house on the right, as it were fronting the east. 2 Chronicles 4:11 ¶ And Chiram made the fleshhooks, and the fire-pans, and the grate of the altar, and all its instruments: and Chiram finished doing all the work which he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God: 2 Chronicles 4:12 two pillars, and upon them an embossed work for the chapiters on the heads of the two pillars, and two nets to cover the heads of the chapiters which are on the heads of the pillars; 2 Chronicles 4:13 and four hundred golden bells for the two nets, and two rows of pomegranates in each net, to cover the two embossed rims of the chapiters which are upon the pillars. 2 Chronicles 4:14 And he made the ten bases, and he made the lavers upon the bases; 2 Chronicles 4:15 and the one sea, and the twelve calves under it; 2 Chronicles 4:16 and the foot-baths, and the buckets, and the caldrons, and the flesh-hooks, and all their furniture (which Chiram made, and brought to king Solomon in the house of the Lord) of pure brass. 2 Chronicles 4:17 In the country round about Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground in the house of Socchoth, and between that and Saredatha. 2 Chronicles 4:18 So Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, for the quantity of brass failed not. 2 Chronicles 4:19 And Solomon made all the vessels of the house of the Lord, and the golden altar, and the tables, and upon them were to be the loaves of shewbread; 2 Chronicles 4:20 also the candlesticks, and the lamps to give light according to the pattern, and in front of the oracle, of pure gold. 2 Chronicles 4:21 And their snuffers, and their lamps were made, and he made the bowls, and the censers, and the fire-pans, of pure gold. 2 Chronicles 4:22 And there was the inner door of the house opening into the holy of holies, and he made the inner doors of the temple of gold. So all the work which Solomon wrought for the house of the Lord was finished. 2 Chronicles 5:1 ¶ And Solomon brought in the holy things of his father David, the silver, and the gold, and the other vessels, and put them in the treasury of the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 5:2 Then Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, even the leaders of the families of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David,-this is Sion. 2 Chronicles 5:3 And all Israel were assembled unto the king in the feast, this is the seventh month. 2 Chronicles 5:4 And all the elders of Israel came; and all the Levites took up the ark, 2 Chronicles 5:5 and the tabernacle of witness, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle; and the priests and the Levites brought it up. 2 Chronicles 5:6 And king Solomon, and all the elders of Israel, and the religious of them, and they of them that were gathered before the ark, were sacrificing calves and sheep, which could not be numbered or reckoned for multitude. 2 Chronicles 5:7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place, into the oracle of the house, even into the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubs. 2 Chronicles 5:8 And the cherubs stretched out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubs covered the ark, and its staves above. 2 Chronicles 5:9 And the staves projected, and the heads of the staves were seen from the holy place in front of the oracle, they were not seen without: and there they were to this day. 2 Chronicles 5:10 There was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses placed there in Choreb, which God gave in covenant with the children of Israel, when they went out of the land of Egypt. 2 Chronicles 5:11 ¶ And it came to pass, when the priests when out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were found were sanctified, they were not then arranged according to their daily course,) 2 Chronicles 5:12 that all the singing Levites assigned to the sons of Asaph, to Aeman, to Idithun, and to his sons, and to his brethren, of them that were clothed in linen garments, with cymbals and lutes and harps, were standing before the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests, blowing trumpets. 2 Chronicles 5:13 And there was one voice in the trumpeting and in the psalm-singing, and in the loud utterance with one voice to give thanks and praise the Lord; and when they raised their voice together with trumpets and cymbals, and instruments of music, and said, Give thanks to the Lord, for it is good, for his mercy endures for ever:-then the house was filled with the cloud of the glory of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 5:14 And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord filled the house of God. 2 Chronicles 6:1 ¶ Then said Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in thick darkness. 2 Chronicles 6:2 But I have built a house to thy name, holy to thee, and prepared for thee to dwell in for ever. 2 Chronicles 6:3 And the king turned his face, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood by. 2 Chronicles 6:4 And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: he has even fulfilled with his hands as he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying, 2 Chronicles 6:5 From the day when I brought up my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city of all the tribes of Israel, to build a house that my name should be there; neither did I choose a man to be a leader over my people Israel. 2 Chronicles 6:6 But I chose Jerusalem that my name should be there; and I chose David to be over my people Israel. 2 Chronicles 6:7 And it came into the heart of David my father, to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel. 2 Chronicles 6:8 But the Lord said to my father David, Whereas it came into thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it came into thy heart. 2 Chronicles 6:9 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; for thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name. 2 Chronicles 6:10 And the Lord has confirmed this word, which he spoke; and I am raised up in the room of my father David, and I sit upon the throne of Israel as the Lord said, and I have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel: 2 Chronicles 6:11 and I have set there the ark in which is the covenant of the Lord, which he made with Israel. 2 Chronicles 6:12 ¶ And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread out his hands. 2 Chronicles 6:13 For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, and set it in the midst of the court of the sanctuary; the length of it was five cubits, and the breadth of it five cubits, and the height of it three cubits: and he stood upon it, and fell upon his knees before the whole congregation of Israel, and spread abroad his hands to heaven, 2 Chronicles 6:14 and said, Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heaven, or on the earth; keeping covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with their whole heart. 2 Chronicles 6:15 Even as thou hast kept them with thy servant David my father, as thou hast spoken to him in words:-thou hast both spoken with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hands, as it is this day. 2 Chronicles 6:16 and now, Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father the things which thou spokest to him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man before me sitting on the throne of Israel, if only thy sons will take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou didst walk before me. 2 Chronicles 6:17 And now, Lord God of Israel, let, I pray thee, thy word be confirmed, which thou hast spoken to thy servant David. 2 Chronicles 6:18 For will God indeed dwell with men upon the earth? if the heaven and the heaven of heavens will not suffice thee, what then is this house which I have built? 2 Chronicles 6:19 Yet thou shalt have respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to my petition, O Lord God, so as to hearken to the petition and the prayer which thy servant prays before thee this day: 2 Chronicles 6:20 so that thine eyes should be open over this house by day and by night, towards this place, whereon thou saidst thy name should be called, so as to hear the prayer which thy servant prays towards this house. 2 Chronicles 6:21 And thou shalt hear the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, whatsoever prayers they shall make towards this place: and thou shalt hearken in thy dwelling-place out of heaven, yea thou shalt hear, and be merciful. 2 Chronicles 6:22 If a man sin against his neighbour, and he bring an oath upon him so as to make him swear, and he come and swear before the altar in this house; 2 Chronicles 6:23 then shalt thou hearken out of heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, to recompense the transgressor, and to return his ways upon his head: and to justify the righteous, to recompense him according to his righteousness. 2 Chronicles 6:24 And if thy people Israel should be put to the worse before the enemy, if they should sin against thee, and then turn and confess to thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house; 2 Chronicles 6:25 then shalt thou hearken out of heaven and shalt be merciful to the sins of thy people Israel, and thou shalt restore them to the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers. 2 Chronicles 6:26 When heaven is restrained, and there is no rain, because they shall have sinned against thee, and when they shall pray towards this place, and praise thy name, and shall turn from their sins, because thou shalt afflict them; 2 Chronicles 6:27 then shalt thou hearken from heaven, and thou shalt be merciful to the sins of thy servants, and of thy people Israel; for thou shalt shew them the good way in which they shall walk; and thou shalt send rain upon thy land, which thou gavest to thy people for an inheritance. 2 Chronicles 6:28 If there should be famine upon the land, if there should be death, a pestilent wind an blight; if there should be locust and caterpiller, and if the enemy should harass them before their cities: in whatever plague and whatever distress they may be; 2 Chronicles 6:29 Then whatever prayer and whatever supplication shall be made by any man and all thy people Israel, if a man should know his own plague and his own sickness, and should spread forth his hands toward this house; 2 Chronicles 6:30 then shalt thou hear from heaven, out of thy prepared dwelling-place, and shalt be merciful, and shalt recompense to the man according to his ways, as thou shalt know his heart to be; for thou alone knowest the heart of the children of men: 2 Chronicles 6:31 that they may reverence all thy ways all the days which they live upon the face of the land, which thou gavest to our fathers. 2 Chronicles 6:32 And every stranger who is not himself of thy people Israel, and who shall have come from a distant land because of thy great name, and thy mighty hand, and thy high arm; when they shall come and worship toward this place;- 2 Chronicles 6:33 then shalt thou hearken out of heaven, out of thy prepared dwelling-place, and shalt do according to all that the stranger shall call upon thee for; that all the nations of the earth may know thy name, and that they may fear thee, as thy people Israel do, and that they may know that thy name is called upon this house which I have built. 2 Chronicles 6:34 And if thy people shall go forth to war against their enemies by the way by which thou shalt send them, and shall pray to thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built to thy name; 2 Chronicles 6:35 then shalt thou hear out of heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. 2 Chronicles 6:36 Whereas if they shall sin against thee, (for there is no man who will not sin,) and thou shalt smite them, and deliver them up before their enemies, and they that take them captive shall carry them away into a land of enemies, to a land far off or near; 2 Chronicles 6:37 and if they shall repent in their land whither they were carried captive, and shall also turn and make supplication to thee in their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have transgressed, we have wrought unrighteously; 2 Chronicles 6:38 and if they shall turn to thee with all their heart and all their soul in the land of them that carried them captives, whither they carried them captives, and shall pray toward their land which thou gavest to their fathers, and the city which thou didst choose, and the house which I built to thy name:- 2 Chronicles 6:39 then shalt thou hear out of heaven, out of thy prepared dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplication, and thou shalt execute justice, and shalt be merciful to thy people that sin against thee. 2 Chronicles 6:40 And now, Lord, let, I pray thee, thine eyes be opened, and thine ears be attentive to the petition made in this place. 2 Chronicles 6:41 And now, O Lord God, arise into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Lord God, clothe themselves with salvation, and thy sons rejoice in prosperity. 2 Chronicles 6:42 O Lord God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of thy servant David. 2 Chronicles 7:1 ¶ And when Solomon had finished praying, then the fire came down from heaven, and devoured the whole-burnt-offerings and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house. 2 Chronicles 7:2 And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord at that time, for the glory of the Lord filled the house. 2 Chronicles 7:3 And all the children of Israel saw the fire descending, and the glory of the Lord was upon the house: and they fell upon their face to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord; for it is good to do so, because his mercy endures for ever. 2 Chronicles 7:4 And the king and all the people were offering sacrifices before the Lord. 2 Chronicles 7:5 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of calves twenty and two thousand, of sheep a hundred and twenty thousand: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 2 Chronicles 7:6 And the priests were standing at their watches, and the Levites with instruments of music of the Lord, belonging to king David, to give thanks before the Lord, for his mercy endures for ever, with the hymns of David, by their ministry: and the priests were blowing the trumpets before them, and all Israel standing. 2 Chronicles 7:7 And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in the house of the Lord: for he offered there the whole-burnt-offerings and the fat of the peace-offerings, for the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not sufficient to receive the whole-burnt-offerings, and the meat-offerings, and the fat. 2 Chronicles 7:8 And Solomon kept the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entering in of Aemath, and as far as the river of Egypt. 2 Chronicles 7:9 And on the eighth day he kept a solemn assembly: for he kept a feast of seven days as the dedication of the altar. 2 Chronicles 7:10 And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he dismissed the people to their tents, rejoicing, and with a glad heart because of the good deeds which the Lord had done to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people. 2 Chronicles 7:11 So Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king's house: and in whatever Solomon wished in his heart to do in the house of the Lord and in his own house, he prospered. 2 Chronicles 7:12 ¶ And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard thy prayer, and I have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice. 2 Chronicles 7:13 If I should restrain the heaven and there should be no rain, and if I should command the locust to devour the trees, and if I should send pestilence upon my people; 2 Chronicles 7:14 then if my people, on whom my name is called, should repent, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their evil ways, I also will hear from heaven, and I will be merciful to their sins, and I will heal their land. 2 Chronicles 7:15 And now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place. 2 Chronicles 7:16 And now I have chosen and sanctified this house, that my name should be there for ever: and my eyes and my heart shall be there always. 2 Chronicles 7:17 And if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father did, and wilt do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my ordinances and my judgments; 2 Chronicles 7:18 then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom, as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man ruling in Israel. 2 Chronicles 7:19 But if ye should turn away, and forsake my ordinances and my commandments, which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them; 2 Chronicles 7:20 then will I remove you from the land which I gave them; and this house which I have consecrated to my name I will remove out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a by-word among all nations. 2 Chronicles 7:21 And as for this lofty house, every one that passes by it shall be amazed, and shall say, Wherefore has the Lord done thus to this land, and to this house? 2 Chronicles 7:22 And men shall say, Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they attached themselves to other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: and therefore he has brought upon them all this evil. 2 Chronicles 8:1 ¶ And it came to pass after twenty years, in which Solomon built the house of the Lord, and his own house, 2 Chronicles 8:2 that Solomon rebuilt the cities which Chiram had given to Solomon, and caused the children of Israel to dwell in them. 2 Chronicles 8:3 And Solomon came to Baesoba, and fortified it. 2 Chronicles 8:4 And he built Thoedmor in the wilderness, and all the strong cities which he built in Emath. 2 Chronicles 8:5 And he built Baethoron the upper, and Baethoron the lower, strong cities,-they had walls, gates, and bars; 2 Chronicles 8:6 and Balaath, and all the strong cities which Solomon had, and all his chariot cities, and cities of horsemen, and all things that Solomon desired according to his desire of building, in Jerusalem, and in Libanus, and in all his kingdom. 2 Chronicles 8:7 As for all the people that was left of the Chettites, and the Amorites, and the Pherezites, and the Evites, and the Jebusites, who are not of Israel, 2 Chronicles 8:8 but were of the children of them whom the children Israel destroyed not, that were left after them in the land, even them did Solomon make tributaries to this day. 2 Chronicles 8:9 But Solomon did not make any of the children of Israel servants in his kingdom; for, behold, they were warriors and rulers, and mighty men, and captains of chariots and horsemen. 2 Chronicles 8:10 And these are the chiefs of the officers of king Solomon, two hundred and fifty overseeing the work among the people. 2 Chronicles 8:11 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharao from the city of David to the house which he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the city of David, the king of Israel, for the place is holy into which the ark of the Lord has entered. 2 Chronicles 8:12 ¶ Then Solomon offered up to the Lord whole-burnt-offerings on the altar which he had built to the Lord before the temple, 2 Chronicles 8:13 according to the daily rate, to offer up sacrifices according to the commandments of Moses, on the sabbaths, and at the new moons, and at the feasts, three times in the year, at the feast of unleavened bread, and at the feast of weeks, and at the feast of tabernacles. 2 Chronicles 8:14 And he established, according to the order of his father David, the courses of the priests, and that according to their public ministrations: and the Levites were appointed over their charges, to praise and minister before the priests according to the daily order: and the porters were appointed according to their courses to the different gates: for thus were the commandments of David the man of God. 2 Chronicles 8:15 They transgressed not the commandments of the king concerning the priests and the Levites with regard to everything else, and with regard to the treasures. 2 Chronicles 8:16 Now all the work had been prepared from the day when the foundation was laid, until Solomon finished the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 8:17 Then Solomon went to Gasion Gaber, and to Aelath near the sea in the land of Idumea. 2 Chronicles 8:18 And Chiram sent by the hand of his servants ships, and servants skilled in naval affairs; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Sophira, and brought thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and they came to king Solomon. 2 Chronicles 9:1 ¶ And the queen of Saba heard of the name of Solomon, and she came to Jerusalem with a very large force, to prove Solomon with hard questions, and she had camels bearing spices in abundance, and gold, and precious stones: and she came to Solomon, and told him all that was in her mind. 2 Chronicles 9:2 And Solomon told her all her words; and there passed not a word from Solomon which he told her not. 2 Chronicles 9:3 And the queen of Saba saw the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had built, 2 Chronicles 9:4 and the meat of the tables, and the sitting of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, and their raiment; and his cupbearers, and their apparel; and the whole-burnt-offerings which he offered up in the house of the Lord; then she was in ecstasy. 2 Chronicles 9:5 And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in my land concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom. 2 Chronicles 9:6 Yet I believed not the reports until I came, and my eyes saw: and, behold, the half of the abundance of thy wisdom was not told me: thou hast exceeded the report which I heard. 2 Chronicles 9:7 Blessed are thy men, blessed are these thy servants, who stand before thee continually, and hear thy wisdom. 2 Chronicles 9:8 Blessed be the Lord thy God, who took pleasure in thee, to set thee upon his throne for a king, to the Lord thy God: forasmuch as the Lord thy God loved Israel to establish them for ever, therefore he has set thee over them for a king to execute judgment and justice. 2 Chronicles 9:9 And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in very great abundance, and precious stones: and there were not any where else such spices as those which the queen of Saba gave king Solomon. 2 Chronicles 9:10 And the servants of Solomon and the servants of Chiram brought gold to Solomon out of Suphir, and pine timber, and precious stones. 2 Chronicles 9:11 And the king made of the pine timber steps to the house of the Lord, and to the king's house, and harps and lutes for the singers: and such were not seen before in the land of Juda. 2 Chronicles 9:12 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Saba all that she requested, besides all that she brought to king Solomon: and she returned to her own land. 2 Chronicles 9:13 ¶ And the weight of the gold that was brought to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty- six talents of gold, 2 Chronicles 9:14 besides what the men who were regularly appointed and the merchants brought, and all the kings of Arabia and princes of the land: all brought gold and silver to king Solomon. 2 Chronicles 9:15 And king Solomon made two hundred shields of beaten gold: there were six hundred shekels of pure gold to one shield. 2 Chronicles 9:16 And three hundred buckles of beaten gold: the weight of three hundred gold shekels went to one buckler: and the king placed them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 2 Chronicles 9:17 And the king made a great throne of ivory, and he gilded it with pure gold. 2 Chronicles 9:18 And there were six steps to the throne, riveted with gold, and elbows on either side of the seat of the throne, and two lions standing by the elbows: 2 Chronicles 9:19 and twelve lions standing there on the six steps on each side. There was not the like in any other kingdom. 2 Chronicles 9:20 And all king Solomon's vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were covered with gold: silver was not thought anything of in the days of Solomon. 2 Chronicles 9:21 For a ship went for the king to Tharsis with the servants of Chiram: once every three years came vessels from Tharsis to the king, laden with gold, and silver, and ivory, and apes. 2 Chronicles 9:22 And Solomon exceeded all other kings both in riches and wisdom. 2 Chronicles 9:23 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 2 Chronicles 9:24 And they brought every one his gifts, silver vessels and golden vessels, and raiment, myrrh and spices, horses and mules, a rate every year. 2 Chronicles 9:25 And Solomon had four thousand mares for chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he put them in the chariot cities, and with the king in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 9:26 And he rules over all the kings from the river even to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt. 2 Chronicles 9:27 And the king made gold and silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars as the sycamore trees in the plain for abundance. 2 Chronicles 9:28 And Solomon imported horses from Egypt, and from every other country. 2 Chronicles 9:29 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, the first and the last, behold, these are written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Achia the Selonite, and in the visions of Joel the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nabat. 2 Chronicles 9:30 And Solomon reigned over all Israel forty years. 2 Chronicles 9:31 And Solomon fell asleep, and they buried him in the city of David his father: and Roboam his son reigned in his stead. 2 Chronicles 10:1 ¶ And Roboam came to Sychem: for all Israel came to Sychem to make him king. 2 Chronicles 10:2 And it came to pass when Jeroboam the son of Nabat heard it, (now he was in Egypt, forasmuch as he had fled thither from the face of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. 2 Chronicles 10:3 And they sent and called him: and Jeroboam and all the congregation came to Roboam, saying, 2 Chronicles 10:4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now then abate somewhat of thy father's grievous rule, and of his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve thee. 2 Chronicles 10:5 And he said to them, Go away for three days, and then come to me. So the people departed. 2 Chronicles 10:6 And king Roboam assembled the elders that stood before his father Solomon in his life-time, saying, How do ye counsel me to return an answer to this people? 2 Chronicles 10:7 And they spoke to him, saying, If thou wouldest this day befriend this people, and be kind to them, and speak to them good words, then will they be thy servants for ever. 2 Chronicles 10:8 But he forsook the advice of the old men, who took counsel with him, and he took counsel with the young men who had been brought up with him, who stood before him. 2 Chronicles 10:9 And he said to them, What do ye advise that I should answer this people, who spoke to me, saying, Ease somewhat of the yoke which thy father laid upon us? 2 Chronicles 10:10 And the young men that had been brought up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak to the people that spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and do thou lighten somewhat of it from us; thus shalt thou say, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins. 2 Chronicles 10:11 And whereas my father chastised you with a heavy yoke, I will also add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, and I will chastise you with scorpions. 2 Chronicles 10:12 ¶ And Jeroboam and all the people came to Roboam on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Return to me on the third day. 2 Chronicles 10:13 And the king answered harshly; and king Roboam forsook the counsel of the old men, 2 Chronicles 10:14 and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 2 Chronicles 10:15 And the king hearkened not to the people, for there was a change of their minds from God, saying, The Lord has confirmed his word, which he spoke by the hand of Achia the Selonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and concerning all Israel; 2 Chronicles 10:16 for the king did not hearken to them. And the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David, or inheritance in the son of Jessae? to thy tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So all Israel went to their tents. 2 Chronicles 10:17 But the men of Israel, even those who dwelt in the cities of Juda, remained and made Roboam king over them. 2 Chronicles 10:18 And king Roboam sent to them Adoniram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. And king Roboam hasted to mount his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 10:19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David until this day. 2 Chronicles 11:1 ¶ And Roboam came to Jerusalem; and he assembled Juda and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand young men fit for war, and he waged war with Israel to recover the kingdom to Roboam. 2 Chronicles 11:2 And the Word of the Lord came to Samaias the man of God, saying, 2 Chronicles 11:3 Speak to Roboam the son of Solomon, and to all Juda and Benjamin, saying, 2 Chronicles 11:4 Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, and ye shall not war against your brethren: return every one to his home; for this thing is of me. And they hearkened to the word of the Lord, and returned from going against Jeroboam. 2 Chronicles 11:5 And Roboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and he built walled cities in Judea. 2 Chronicles 11:6 And he built Bethleem, and Aetan and Thecoe, 2 Chronicles 11:7 and Baethsura, and Sochoth, and Odollam, 2 Chronicles 11:8 and Geth, and Marisa, and Ziph, 2 Chronicles 11:9 and Adorai, and Lachis, and Azeca, 2 Chronicles 11:10 and Saraa, and Aelom, and Chebron, which belong to Juda and Benjamin, walled cities. 2 Chronicles 11:11 And he fortified them with walls, and placed in them captains, and stores of provisions, oil and wine, 2 Chronicles 11:12 shields and spears in every several city, and he fortified them very strongly, and he had on his side Juda and Benjamin. 2 Chronicles 11:13 ¶ And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel were gathered to him out of all the coasts. 2 Chronicles 11:14 For the Levites left the tents of their possession, and went to Juda to Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had ejected them so that they should not minister to the Lord. 2 Chronicles 11:15 And he made for himself priests of the high places, and for the idols, and for the vanities, and for the calves which Jeroboam made. 2 Chronicles 11:16 And he cast out from the tribes of Israel those who set their heart to seek the Lord God of Israel: and they came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the Lord God of their fathers. 2 Chronicles 11:17 And they strengthened the kingdom of Juda; and Juda strengthened Roboam the son of Solomon for three years, for he walked three years in the ways of David and Solomon. 2 Chronicles 11:18 And Roboam took to himself for a wife, Moolath daughter of Jerimuth the son of David, and Abigaia daughter of Heliab the son of Jessae. 2 Chronicles 11:19 And she bore him sons; Jeus, and Samoria, and Zaam. 2 Chronicles 11:20 And afterwards he took to himself Maacha the daughter of Abessalom; and she bore him Abia, and Jetthi, and Zeza, and Salemoth. 2 Chronicles 11:21 And Roboam loved Maacha the daughter of Abessalom more than all his wives and all his concubines: for he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines; and he begot twenty-eight sons, and sixty daughters. 2 Chronicles 11:22 And he made Abia the son of Maacha chief, even a leader among his brethren, for he intended to make him king. 2 Chronicles 11:23 And he was exalted beyond all his other sons in all the coasts of Juda and Benjamin, and in the strong cities; and he gave them provisions in great abundance: and he desired many wives. 2 Chronicles 12:1 ¶ And it came to pass when the kingdom of Roboam was established, and when he had grown strong, that he forsook the commandments of the Lord, and all Israel with him. 2 Chronicles 12:2 And it came to pass in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Susakim king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had sinned against the Lord, 2 Chronicles 12:3 with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horses: and there was no number of the multitude that came with him from Egypt; Libyans, Trogodytes, and Ethiopians. 2 Chronicles 12:4 And they obtained possession of the strong cities, which were in Juda, and came to Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 12:5 And Samaias the prophet came to Roboam, and to the princes of Juda that were gathered to Jerusalem for fear of Susakim, and said to them, Thus said the Lord, Ye have left me, and I will leave you in the hand of Susakim. 2 Chronicles 12:6 And the elders of Israel and the king were ashamed, and said, The Lord is righteous. 2 Chronicles 12:7 And when the Lord saw that they repented, then came the word of the Lord to Samaias, saying, They have repented; I will not destroy them, but I will set them in safety for a little while, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 12:8 Nevertheless they shall be servants, and know my service, and the service of the kings of the earth. 2 Chronicles 12:9 So Susakim king of Egypt went up against Jerusalem, and took the treasures that were in the house of the Lord, and the treasures that were in the king's house: he took all; and he took the golden shields which Solomon had made. 2 Chronicles 12:10 And king Roboam made brazen shields instead of them. And Susakim set over him captains of footmen, as keepers of the gate of the king. 2 Chronicles 12:11 And it came to pass, when the king went into the house of the Lord, the guards and the footmen went in, and they that returned to meet the footmen. 2 Chronicles 12:12 And when he repented, the anger of the Lord turned from him, and did not destroy him utterly; for there were good things in Juda. 2 Chronicles 12:13 ¶ So king Roboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: and Roboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, in the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of the children of Israel to call his name there: and his mother's name was Noomma the Ammanitess. 2 Chronicles 12:14 And he did evil, for he directed not his heart to seek the Lord. 2 Chronicles 12:15 And the acts of Roboam, the first and the last, behold, are they not written in the book of Samaia the prophet, and Addo the seer, with his achievements. 2 Chronicles 12:16 And Roboam made war with Jeroboam all his days. And Roboam died with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abia his son reigned in his stead. 2 Chronicles 13:1 ¶ In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam Abia began to reign over Juda. 2 Chronicles 13:2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maacha, daughter of Uriel of Gabaon. And there was war between Abia and Jeroboam. 2 Chronicles 13:3 And Abia set the battle in array with an army, with mighty men of war, even four hundred thousand mighty men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand, they were mighty warriors of the host. 2 Chronicles 13:4 And Abia rose up from the mount Somoron, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear ye, Jeroboam, and all Israel: 2 Chronicles 13:5 Is it not for you to know that the Lord God of Israel has given a king over Israel for ever to David, and to his sons, by a covenant of salt? 2 Chronicles 13:6 But Jeroboam the son of Nabat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and has revolted from his master: 2 Chronicles 13:7 and there are gathered to him pestilent men, transgressors, and he has risen up against Roboam the son of Solomon, while Roboam was young and fearful in heart, and he withstood him not. 2 Chronicles 13:8 And now ye profess to resist the kingdom of the Lord in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and with you are golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods. 2 Chronicles 13:9 Did ye not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make to yourselves priests of the people of any other land? whoever came to consecrate himself with a calf of the heard and seven rams, he forthwith became a priest to that which is no god. 2 Chronicles 13:10 But we have not forsaken the Lord our God, and his priests, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, minister to the Lord; and in their daily courses 2 Chronicles 13:11 they sacrifice to the Lord whole-burnt-offering, morning and evening, and compound incense, and set the shewbread on the pure table; and there is the golden candlestick, and the lamps for burning, to light in the evening: for we keep the charge of the Lord God of our fathers; but ye have forsaken him. 2 Chronicles 13:12 And, behold, the Lord and his priests are with us at our head, and the signal trumpets to sound an alarm over us. Children of Israel, fight not against the Lord God of our fathers; for ye shall not prosper. 2 Chronicles 13:13 ¶ Now Jeroboam had caused an ambush to come round upon him from behind: and he himself was before Juda, and the ambush behind. 2 Chronicles 13:14 And Juda looked back, and, behold, the battle was against them before and behind: and they cried to the Lord, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. 2 Chronicles 13:15 And the men of Juda shouted: and it came to pass, when the men of Juda shouted, that the Lord smote Jeroboam and Israel before Abia and Juda. 2 Chronicles 13:16 And the children of Israel fled from before Juda; and the Lord delivered them into their hands. 2 Chronicles 13:17 And Abia and his people smote them with a great slaughter: and there fell slain of Israel five hundred thousand mighty men. 2 Chronicles 13:18 So the children of Israel were brought low in that day, and the children of Juda prevailed, because they trusted on the Lord God of their fathers. 2 Chronicles 13:19 And Abia pursued after Jeroboam, and he took from him the cities, Baethel and her towns, and Jesyna and her towns, and Ephron and her towns. 2 Chronicles 13:20 And Jeroboam did not recover strength again all the days of Abia: and the Lord smote him, and he died. 2 Chronicles 13:21 But Abia strengthened himself, and took to himself fourteen wives, and he begot twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters. 2 Chronicles 13:22 And the rest of the acts of Abia, and his deeds, and his sayings, are written in the book of the prophet Addo. 2 Chronicles 14:1 ¶ And Abia died with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In the days of Asa the land of Juda had rest ten years. 2 Chronicles 14:2 And he did that which was good and right in the sight of the Lord his God. 2 Chronicles 14:3 And he removed the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and broke the pillars in pieces, and cut down the groves: 2 Chronicles 14:4 and he told Juda to seek earnestly the Lord God of their fathers, and to perform the law and commandments. 2 Chronicles 14:5 And he removed from all the cities of Juda the altars and the idols, and established in quietness 2 Chronicles 14:6 fortified cities in the land of Juda; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in these years; for the Lord gave him rest. 2 Chronicles 14:7 And he said to Juda, Let us fortify these cities, and make walls, and towers, and gates, and bars: we shall prevail over the land, for as we have sought out the Lord our God, he has sought out us, and has given us rest round about, and prospered us. 2 Chronicles 14:8 And Asa had a force of armed men bearing shields and spears in the land of Juda, even three hundred thousand, and in the land of Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand targeteers and archers: all these were mighty warriors. 2 Chronicles 14:9 ¶ And Zare the Ethiopian went out against them, with a force of a million, and three hundred chariots; and came to Maresa. 2 Chronicles 14:10 And Asa went out to meet him, and set the battle in array in the valley north of Maresa. 2 Chronicles 14:11 And Asa cried to the Lord his God, and said, O Lord, it is not impossible with thee to save by many or by few: strengthen us, O Lord our God; for we trust in thee, and in thy name have we come against this great multitude. O Lord our God, let not man prevail against thee. 2 Chronicles 14:12 And the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Juda; and the Ethiopians fled. 2 Chronicles 14:13 And Asa and his people pursued them to Gedor; and the Ethiopians fell, so that they could not recover themselves; for they were crushed before the Lord, and before his host; and they took many spoils. 2 Chronicles 14:14 And they destroyed their towns roundabout Gedor; for a terror of the Lord was upon them: and they spoiled all their cities, for they had much spoil. 2 Chronicles 14:15 Also they destroyed the tents of cattle, and the Alimazons, and took many sheep and camels, and returned to Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 15:1 ¶ And Azarias the son of Oded-upon him came the Spirit of the Lord, 2 Chronicles 15:2 and he went out to meet Asa, and all Juda and Benjamin, and said, Hear me, Asa, and all Juda and Benjamin. The Lord is with you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him out, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you. 2 Chronicles 15:3 And Israel has been a long time without the true God, and without a priest to expound the truth, and without the law. 2 Chronicles 15:4 But he shall turn them to the Lord God of Israel, and he will be found of them. 2 Chronicles 15:5 And in that time there is no peace to one going out, or to one coming in, for the terror of the Lord is upon all that inhabit the lands. 2 Chronicles 15:6 And nation shall fight against nation, and city against city; for God has confounded them with every kind of affliction. 2 Chronicles 15:7 But be ye strong, and let not your hands be weakened: for there is a reward for your work. 2 Chronicles 15:8 ¶ And when Asa heard these words, and the prophesy of Adad the prophet, then he strengthened himself, and cast out the abominations from all the land of Juda and Benjamin, and from the cities which Jeroboam possessed, in mount Ephraim, and he renewed the altar of the Lord, which was before the temple of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 15:9 And he assembled Juda and Benjamin, and the strangers that dwelt with him, of Ephraim, and of Manasse, and of Symeon: for many of Israel were joined to him, when they saw that the Lord his God was with him. 2 Chronicles 15:10 And they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 2 Chronicles 15:11 And he sacrificed to the Lord in that day of the spoils which they brought, seven hundred calves and seven thousand sheep. 2 Chronicles 15:12 And he entered into a covenant that they should seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul. 2 Chronicles 15:13 And that whoever should not seek the Lord God of Israel, should die, whether young or old, whether man or woman. 2 Chronicles 15:14 And they swore to the Lord with a loud voice, and with trumpets, and with cornets. 2 Chronicles 15:15 And all Juda rejoiced concerning the oath: for they swore with all their heart, and they sought him with all their desires; and he was found of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about. 2 Chronicles 15:16 And he removed Maacha his mother from being priestess to Astarte; and he cut down the idol, and burnt it in the brook of Kedron. 2 Chronicles 15:17 Nevertheless they removed not the high places: they still existed in Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days. 2 Chronicles 15:18 And he brought in the holy things of David his father, and the holy things of the house of God, silver, and gold, and vessels. 2 Chronicles 15:19 And there was no war waged with him until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa. 2 Chronicles 16:1 ¶ And in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Asa, the king of Israel went up against Juda, and built Rama, so as not to allow egress or ingress to Asa king of Juda. 2 Chronicles 16:2 And Asa took silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and sent them to the son of Ader king of Syria, which dwelt in Damascus, saying, 2 Chronicles 16:3 Make a covenant between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee gold and silver: come, and turn away from me Baasa king of Israel, and let him depart from me. 2 Chronicles 16:4 And the son of Ader hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his host against the cities of Israel; and smote Aeon, and Dan, and Abelmain, and all the country round Nephthali. 2 Chronicles 16:5 And it came to pass when Baasa heard it he left off building Rama, and put a stop to his work: 2 Chronicles 16:6 then king Asa took all Juda, and took the stones of Rama, and its timber, with which Baasa had built; and he built with them Gabae and Maspha. 2 Chronicles 16:7 ¶ And at that time came Anani the prophet to Asa king of Juda, and said to him, Because thou didst trust on the king of Syria, and didst not trust on the Lord thy God, therefore the army of Syria is escaped out of thy hand. 2 Chronicles 16:8 Were not the Ethiopians and Libyans a great force, in courage, in horsemen, in great numbers? and did not He deliver them into thy hands, because thou trustedst in the Lord? 2 Chronicles 16:9 For the eyes of the Lord look upon all the earth, to strengthen every heart that is perfect toward him. In this thou hast done foolishly; henceforth there shall be war with thee. 2 Chronicles 16:10 And Asa was angry with the prophet, and put him in prison, for he was angry at this: and Asa vexed some of the people at that time. 2 Chronicles 16:11 And, behold, the acts of Asa, the first and the last, are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel. 2 Chronicles 16:12 And Asa was diseased in his feet in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, until he was very ill: but in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians. 2 Chronicles 16:13 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the fortieth year of his reign. 2 Chronicles 16:14 And they buried him in the sepulchre which he had dug for himself in the city of David, and they laid him on a bed, and filled it with spices and all kinds of perfumes of the apothecaries; and they made for him a very great funeral. 2 Chronicles 17:1 ¶ And Josaphat his son reigned in his stead, Josaphat strengthened himself against Israel. 2 Chronicles 17:2 And he put garrisons in all the strong cities of Juda, and appointed captains in all the cities of Juda, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. 2 Chronicles 17:3 And the Lord was with Josaphat, for he walked in the first ways of his father, and did not seek to idols; 2 Chronicles 17:4 but he sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in the commandments of his father, and not according to the works of Israel. 2 Chronicles 17:5 And the Lord prospered the kingdom in his hand; and all Juda gave gifts to Josaphat; and he had great wealth and glory. 2 Chronicles 17:6 And his heart was exalted in the way of the Lord; and he removed the high places and the groves from the land of Juda. 2 Chronicles 17:7 And in the third year of his reign, he sent his chief men, and his mighty men, Abdias and Zacharias, and Nathanael, and Michaias, to teach in the cities of Juda. 2 Chronicles 17:8 And with them were the Levites, Samaias, and Nathanias, and Zabdias, and Asiel, and Semiramoth, and Jonathan, and Adonias, and Tobias, and Tobadonias, Levites, and with them Elisama and Joram, the priests. 2 Chronicles 17:9 And they taught in Juda, and there was with them the book of the law of the Lord, and they passed through the cities of Juda, and taught the people. 2 Chronicles 17:10 ¶ And a terror of the Lord was upon all the kingdoms of the land round about Juda, and they made no war against Josaphat. 2 Chronicles 17:11 And some of the Philistines brought to Josaphat gifts, and silver, and presents; and the Arabians brought him seven thousand seven hundred rams. 2 Chronicles 17:12 And Josaphat increased in greatness exceedingly, and built in Judea places of abode, and strong cities. 2 Chronicles 17:13 And he had many works in Judea: and the mighty men of war, the men of strength, were in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 17:14 And this is their number according to the houses of their fathers; even the captains of thousands in Juda were, Ednas the chief, and with him mighty men of strength three hundred thousand. 2 Chronicles 17:15 And after him, Joanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand. 2 Chronicles 17:16 And after him Amasias the son of Zari, who was zealous for the Lord; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of strength. 2 Chronicles 17:17 And out of Benjamin there was a mighty man of strength, even Eliada, and with him two hundred thousand archers and targeteers. 2 Chronicles 17:18 And after him Jozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty thousand mighty men of war. 2 Chronicles 17:19 These were the king's servants besides those whom the king put in the strong cities in all Judea. 2 Chronicles 18:1 ¶ And Josaphat had yet great wealth and glory, and he connected himself by marriage with the house of Achaab. 2 Chronicles 18:2 And he went down after a term of years to Achaab to Samaria: and Achaab slew for him sheep and calves, in abundance, and for the people with him, and he much desired him to go up with him to Ramoth of the country of Galaad. 2 Chronicles 18:3 And Achaab king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth of the country of Galaad? And he said to him, As I am, so also art thou, as thy people, so also is my people with thee for the war. 2 Chronicles 18:4 ¶ And Josaphat said to the king of Israel, Seek, I pray thee, the Lord to-day. 2 Chronicles 18:5 And the king of Israel gathered the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, and God shall deliver it into the hands of the king. 2 Chronicles 18:6 And Josaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we may enquire of him? 2 Chronicles 18:7 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, There is yet one man by whom to enquire of the Lord; but I hate him, for he does not prophesy concerning me for good, for all his days are for evil: this is Michaias the son of Jembla. And Josaphat said, Let not the king say so. 2 Chronicles 18:8 And the king called an eunuch, and said, Fetch quickly Michaias the son of Jembla. 2 Chronicles 18:9 And the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda were sitting each on his throne, and clothed in their robes, sitting in the open space at the entrance of the gate of Samaria: and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 2 Chronicles 18:10 And Sedekias son of Chanaan made for himself iron horns, and said, Thus saith the Lord, With these thou shalt thrust Syria until it be consumed. 2 Chronicles 18:11 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Galaad, and thou shalt prosper; and the Lord shall deliver it into the hands of the king. 2 Chronicles 18:12 And the messenger that went to call Michaias spoke to him, saying, Behold, the prophets have spoken favourably concerning the king with one mouth; let now, I pray thee, thy words be as the words of one of them, and do thou speak good things. 2 Chronicles 18:13 And Michaias said, As the Lord lives, whatever God shall say to me, that will I speak. 2 Chronicles 18:14 And he came to the king, and the king said to him, Michaias, shall I go up to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go up, and thou shalt prosper, and they shall be given into your hands. 2 Chronicles 18:15 And the king said to him, How often shall I solemnly charge thee that thou speak to me nothing but truth in the name of the Lord? 2 Chronicles 18:16 And he said, I saw Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep without a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no commander; let each return to his home in peace. 2 Chronicles 18:17 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Said I not to thee, that he would not prophesy concerning me good, but evil? 2 Chronicles 18:18 But he said, Not so. Hear ye the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven stood by on his right hand and on his left. 2 Chronicles 18:19 And the Lord said, Who will deceive Achaab king of Israel, that he may go up, and fall in Ramoth Galaad? And one spoke this way, and another spoke that way. 2 Chronicles 18:20 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will deceive him. And the Lord said, Whereby? 2 Chronicles 18:21 And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt deceive him, and shalt prevail: go forth, and do so. 2 Chronicles 18:22 And now, behold, the Lord has put a false spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil against thee. 2 Chronicles 18:23 Then Sedekias the son of Chanaan drew near, and smote Michaias on the cheek, and said to him, By what way passed the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak to thee? 2 Chronicles 18:24 And Michaias said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hide thyself. 2 Chronicles 18:25 And the king of Israel said, Take Michaias, and carry him back to Emer the governor of the city, and to Joas the captain, the king's son; 2 Chronicles 18:26 and ye shall say, Thus said the king, Put this fellow into the prison house, and let him eat the bread of affliction, and drink the water of affliction, until I return in peace. 2 Chronicles 18:27 And Michaias said, If thou do at all return in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, all ye people. 2 Chronicles 18:28 ¶ So the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, went up to Ramoth Galaad. 2 Chronicles 18:29 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Disguise me, and I will enter into the battle: and do thou put on my raiment. so the king of Israel disguised himself, and entered into the battle. 2 Chronicles 18:30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight neither against small nor great, but only against the king of Israel. 2 Chronicles 18:31 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel: and they compassed him about to fight against him: and Josaphat cried out, and the Lord delivered him; and God turned them away from him. 2 Chronicles 18:32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned away from him. 2 Chronicles 18:33 And a man drew a bow with a good aim, and smote the king of Israel between the lungs and the breast-plate: and he said to the charioteer, Turn thine hand, drive me out of the battle, for I am wounded. 2 Chronicles 18:34 And the battle turned in that day; and the king of Israel remained on the chariot against Syria until evening, and died at sunset. 2 Chronicles 19:1 ¶ And Josaphat king of Juda returned to his house at Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 19:2 And there went out to meet him Jeu the prophet the son of Anani, and said to him, King Josaphat, doest thou help a sinner, or act friendly towards one hated of the Lord? Therefore has wrath come upon thee from the Lord. 2 Chronicles 19:3 Nevertheless some good things have been found in thee, forasmuch as thou didst remove the groves from the land of Juda, and didst direct thine heart to seek after the Lord. 2 Chronicles 19:4 And Josaphat dwelt in Jerusalem: and he again went out among the people from Bersabee to the mount of Ephraim, and turned them back to the Lord God of their fathers. 2 Chronicles 19:5 ¶ And he appointed judges in all the strong cities of Juda, city by city. 2 Chronicles 19:6 And he said to the judges, Take good heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, and with you are matters of judgment. 2 Chronicles 19:7 And now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, and be wary, and do your duty: for there is no unrighteousness with the Lord our God, neither is it for him to respect persons, nor take bribes. 2 Chronicles 19:8 Moreover Josaphat appointed in Jerusalem some of the priests, and Levites, and heads of houses of Israel, for the judgment of the Lord, and to judge the dwellers in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 19:9 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord, in truth and with a perfect heart. 2 Chronicles 19:10 Whatsoever man of your brethren that dwell in their cities shall bring the cause that comes before you, between blood and blood, and between precept and commandment, and ordinances and judgments, ye shall even decide for them; so they shall not sin against the Lord, and there shall not be wrath upon you, and upon your brethren: thus ye shall do, and ye shall not sin. 2 Chronicles 19:11 And, behold, Amarias the priest is head over you in every matter of the Lord; and Zabdias the son of Ismael is head over the house of Juda in every matter of the king; and the scribes and Levites are before you: be strong and active, and the Lord shall be with the good. 2 Chronicles 20:1 ¶ And after this came the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Minaeans, against Josaphat to battle. 2 Chronicles 20:2 And they came and told Josaphat, saying, There is come against thee a great multitude from Syria, from beyond the sea; and, behold, they are in Asasan Thamar, this is Engadi. 2 Chronicles 20:3 And Josaphat was alarmed, and set his face to seek the Lord earnestly, and he proclaimed a fast in all Juda. 2 Chronicles 20:4 And Juda gathered themselves together to seek after the Lord: even from all the cities of Juda they came to seek the Lord. 2 Chronicles 20:5 And Josaphat stood up in the assembly of Juda in Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, in front of the new court. 2 Chronicles 20:6 And he said, O Lord God of my fathers, art not thou God in heaven above, and art not thou Lord of all the kingdoms of the nations? and is there not in thy hand the might of dominion, and there is no one who can resist thee? 2 Chronicles 20:7 Art not thou the Lord that didst destroy the inhabitants of this land before the face of thy people Israel, and didst give it to thy beloved seed of Abraham for ever? 2 Chronicles 20:8 And they dwelt in it, and built in it a sanctuary to thy name, saying, 2 Chronicles 20:9 If there should come upon us evils, sword, judgment, pestilence, famine, we will stand before this house, and before thee, (for thy name is upon this house,) and we will cry to thee because of the affliction, and thou shalt hear, and deliver. 2 Chronicles 20:10 And now, behold, the children of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, with regard to whom thou didst not permit Israel to pass through their border, when they had come out of the land of Egypt, (for they turned away from them, and did not destroy them;)- 2 Chronicles 20:11 yet now, behold, they make attempts against us, to come forth to cast us out from our inheritance which thou gavest us. 2 Chronicles 20:12 O Lord our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no strength to resist this great multitude that is come against us; and we know not what we shall do to them: but our eyes are toward thee. 2 Chronicles 20:13 And all Juda was standing before the Lord, and their children, and their wives. 2 Chronicles 20:14 ¶ And Oziel the son of Zacharias, of the children of Banaias, of the sons of Eleiel, the sons of Matthanias the Levite, of the sons of Asaph,-upon him came the Spirit of the Lord in the assembly: 2 Chronicles 20:15 and he said, Hear ye, all Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem, and king Josaphat: Thus saith the Lord to you, even you, Fear not, neither be alarmed, before all this great multitude; for the battle is not years, but God's. 2 Chronicles 20:16 To-morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Assis, and ye shall find them at the extremity of the river of the wilderness of Jeriel. 2 Chronicles 20:17 It is not for you to fight: understand these things, and see the deliverance of the Lord with you, Juda and Jerusalem: fear not, neither be afraid to go forth to-morrow to meet them; and the Lord shall be with you. 2 Chronicles 20:18 And Josaphat bowed with his face to the ground with all Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem, and they fell before the Lord to worship the Lord. 2 Chronicles 20:19 And the Levites of the children of Caath, and they of the sons of Core, rose up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high. 2 Chronicles 20:20 ¶ And they rose early in the morning and went out to the wilderness of Thecoe: and as they went out, Josaphat stood and cried, and said, Hear me, Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem; put your trust in the Lord God, and your trust shall be honored; trust in his prophet, and ye shall prosper. 2 Chronicles 20:21 And he took counsel with the people, and set appointed men to sing psalms and praises, to give thanks, and sing the holy songs of praise in going forth before the host: and they said, Give thanks to the Lord, for his mercy endures for ever. 2 Chronicles 20:22 And when they began the praise and thanksgiving, the Lord caused the children of Ammon to fight against Moab, and the inhabitants of mount Seir that came out against Juda; and they were routed. 2 Chronicles 20:23 Then the children of Ammon and Moab rose up against the dwellers in mount Seir, to destroy and consume them; and when they had made an end of destroying the inhabitants of Seir, they rose up against one another so that they were utterly destroyed. 2 Chronicles 20:24 And Juda came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, and looked, and saw the multitude, and, behold, they were all fallen dead upon the earth, not one escaped. 2 Chronicles 20:25 And Josaphat and his people went out to spoil them, and they found much cattle, and furniture, and spoils, and precious things: and they spoiled them, and they were three days gathering the spoil, for it was abundant. 2 Chronicles 20:26 And it came to pass on the fourth day they were gathered to the Valley of Blessing; for there they blessed the Lord: therefore they called the name of the place the Valley of Blessing, until this day. 2 Chronicles 20:27 And all the men of Juda returned to Jerusalem, and Josaphat led them with great joy; for the Lord gave them joy over their enemies. 2 Chronicles 20:28 And they entered into Jerusalem with lutes and harps and trumpets, going into the house of the lord. 2 Chronicles 20:29 And there was a terror of the Lord upon all the kingdoms of the land, when they heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel. 2 Chronicles 20:30 And the kingdom of Josaphat was at peace; and his God gave him rest round about. 2 Chronicles 20:31 ¶ And Josaphat reigned over Juda, being thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Azuba, daughter of Sali. 2 Chronicles 20:32 And he walked in the ways of his father Asa, and turned not aside from doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 20:33 nevertheless the high places yet remained; and as yet the people did not direct their heart to the Lord God of their fathers. 2 Chronicles 20:34 And the rest of the acts of Josaphat, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the history of Jeu the son of Anani, who wrote the book of the kings of Israel. 2 Chronicles 20:35 And afterwards Josaphat king of Juda entered into an alliance with Ochozias king of Israel, (now this was an unrighteous man,) 2 Chronicles 20:36 by acting with and going to him, to build ships to go to Tharsis: and he built ships in Gasion Gaber. 2 Chronicles 20:37 And Eliezer thee son of Dodia of Marisa prophesied against Josaphat, saying, Forasmuch as thou hast allied thyself with Ochozias, the Lord has broken thy work, and thy vessels have been wrecked. And they could not go to Tharsis. 2 Chronicles 21:1 ¶ And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Joran his son reigned in his stead. 2 Chronicles 21:2 And he had brothers, the six sons of Josaphat, Azarias, and Jeiel, and Zacharias, and Azarias, and Michael, and Zaphatias: all these were the sons of Josaphat king of Juda. 2 Chronicles 21:3 And their father gave them many gifts, silver, and gold, and arms, together with fortified cities in Juda: but he gave the kingdom to Joram, for he was the first-born. 2 Chronicles 21:4 And Joram entered upon his kingdom, and strengthened himself, and slew all his brothers with the sword, and some of the princes of Israel. 2 Chronicles 21:5 When he was thirty and two years old, Joram succeeded to his kingdom, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 21:6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Achaab; for a daughter of Achaab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: 2 Chronicles 21:7 nevertheless the Lord would not utterly destroy the house of David, because of the covenant which he made with David, and as he said to him that he would give a light to him and his sons for ever. 2 Chronicles 21:8 In those days Edom revolted from Juda, and they made a king over themselves. 2 Chronicles 21:9 And Joram went with the princes, and all the cavalry with him: and it came to pass that he arose by night, and smote Edom that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots, and the people fled to their tents. 2 Chronicles 21:10 And Edom revolted from Juda until this day. Then Lomna at that time revolted from under his hand, because he forsook the Lord God of his fathers. 2 Chronicles 21:11 For he built high places in the cities of Juda, and caused the dwellers in Jerusalem to go a-whoring, and led Juda astray. 2 Chronicles 21:12 ¶ And there came to him a message in writing from Eliu the prophet, saying, Thus saith the Lord God of thy father David, Because thou hast not walked in the way of thy father Josaphat, nor in the ways of Asa king of Juda, 2 Chronicles 21:13 but hast walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and hast caused Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem to go a-whoring, as the house of Achaab caused Israel to go a-whoring, and thou hast slain thy brethren, the sons of thy father, who were better than thyself; 2 Chronicles 21:14 behold, the Lord shall smite thee with a great plague among thy people, and thy sons, and thy wives, and all thy store: 2 Chronicles 21:15 and thou shalt be afflicted with a grievous disease, with a disease of the bowels, until thy bowels shall fall out day by day with the sickness. 2 Chronicles 21:16 So the Lord stirred up the Philistines against Joram, and the Arabians, and those who bordered on the Aethiopians: 2 Chronicles 21:17 and they went up against Juda, and prevailed against them, and took away all the store which they found in the house of the king, and his sons, and his daughters; and there was no son left to him but Ochozias the youngest of his sons. 2 Chronicles 21:18 And after all these things the Lord smote him in the bowels with an incurable disease. 2 Chronicles 21:19 And it continued from day to day: and when the time of the days came to two years, his bowels fell out with the disease, and he died by a grievous distemper: and his people performed no funeral, like the funeral of his fathers. 2 Chronicles 21:20 He was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he departed without honour, and was buried in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. 2 Chronicles 22:1 ¶ And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ochozias his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of robbers that came against them, even the Arabians and the Alimazonians, had slain all the elder ones. So Ochozias son of Joram king of Juda reigned. 2 Chronicles 22:2 Ochozias began to reign when he was twenty years old, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Gotholia, the daughter of Ambri. 2 Chronicles 22:3 And he walked in the way of the house of Achaab; for his mother was his counsellor to do evil. 2 Chronicles 22:4 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord as the house of Achaab had done: for they were his counselors after the death of his father to his destruction. 2 Chronicles 22:5 And he walked in their counsels, and he went with Joram son of Achaab king of Israel to war against Azael king of Syria to Ramoth Galaad: and the archers smote Joram. 2 Chronicles 22:6 And Joram returned to Jezrael to be healed of the wounds wherewith the Syrians smote him in Ramoth, when he fought against Azael king of Syria. And Ochozias son of Joram, king of Juda, went down to see Joram the son of Achaab at Jezrael because he was sick. 2 Chronicles 22:7 And destruction from God came upon Ochozias in his coming to Joram; for when he had come, Joram went out with him against Jeu the son of Namessei, the anointed of the Lord against the house of Achaab. 2 Chronicles 22:8 And it came to pass, when Jeu was taking vengeance on the house of Achaab, that he found the princes of Juda and the brethren of Ochozias ministering to Ochozias, and he slew them. 2 Chronicles 22:9 And he gave orders to seek Ochozias: and they took him while he was healing his wounds in Samaria, and they brought him to Jeu, and he slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Josaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart. So there was none in the house of Ochozias to secure their power in the kingdom. 2 Chronicles 22:10 ¶ And Gotholia the mother of Ochozias saw that her son was dead, and she arose and destroyed all the seed royal in the house of Juda. 2 Chronicles 22:11 But Josabeeth, the daughter of the king, took Joas the son of Ochozias and rescued him secretly out of the midst of the sons of the king that were put to death, and she placed him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Josabeeth daughter of king Joram, sister of Ochozias, wife of Jodae the priest, hid him, and she even hid him from Gotholia, and she did not slay him. 2 Chronicles 22:12 And he was with him hid in the house of God six years; and Gotholia reigned over the land. 2 Chronicles 23:1 ¶ And in the eighth year Jodae strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azarias the son of Joram, and Ismael the son of Joanan, and Azarias the son of Obed, and Maasaeas the son of Adia, and Elisaphan the son of Zacharias, with him unto the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 23:2 And they went round about Juda, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Juda, and heads of the families of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 23:3 and all the congregation of Juda made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he shewed them the king's son, and said to them, Lo, let the king's son reign, as the Lord said concerning the house of David. 2 Chronicles 23:4 Now this is the thing which ye shall do. Let a third part of you, even of the priests and of the Levites, enter in on the sabbath, even into the gates of the entrances; 2 Chronicles 23:5 and let a third part be in the house of the king; and another third at the middle gate: and all the people in the courts of the Lord's house. 2 Chronicles 23:6 And let not any one enter into the house of the Lord, except the priests and the Levites, and the servants of the Levites; they shall enter in, because they are holy: and let all the people keep the watch of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 23:7 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man's weapon in his hand; and whoever else goes into the house shall die: but they shall be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in. 2 Chronicles 23:8 And the Levites and all Juda did according to all that the priest Jodae commanded them, and they took each his men from the beginning of the sabbath to the end of the sabbath, for Jodae the priest did not dismiss the courses. 2 Chronicles 23:9 And Jodae gave to the men the swords, and the shields, and the arms, which had belonged to King David, in the house of God. 2 Chronicles 23:10 And he set the whole people, every man with his arms, from the right side of the house to the left side of the altar and the house, over against the king round about. 2 Chronicles 23:11 And he brought out the king's son, and put on him the crown and the testimony, and Jodae the priest and his sons proclaimed him king, and anointed him, and said, Long live the king! 2 Chronicles 23:12 ¶ And Gotholia heard the sound of the people running, and acknowledging and praising the king: and she went in to the king into the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 23:13 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood in his place, and the princes and trumpets were at the entrance, and the princes were round the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded the trumpets, and there were the singers singing with instruments, and singing hymns of praise. and Gotholia rent her robe, and cried, ye surely are plotting against me. 2 Chronicles 23:14 And Jodae the priest went forth, and Jodae the priest charged the captains of hundreds, even the captains of the host, and said to them, Thrust her forth outside the house, and follow her, and let her be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 23:15 So they let her go out; and she went through the horsemen's gate of the house of the king, and they slew her there. 2 Chronicles 23:16 And Jodae made a covenant between himself, and the people, and the king, that the people should be the Lord's. 2 Chronicles 23:17 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and tore down it and its altars, and they ground his images to powder, and they slew Matthan the priest of Baal before his altars. 2 Chronicles 23:18 And Jodae the priest committed the works of the house of the Lord into the and of the priests and Levites, and he re-established the courses of the priests and Levites which David appointed over the house of the Lord, and he appointed them to offer whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord, as it is written in the law of Moses, with gladness, and with songs by the hand of David. 2 Chronicles 23:19 And the porters stood at the gates of the house of the Lord, that no one unclean in any respect should enter in. 2 Chronicles 23:20 And he took the heads of families, and the mighty men, and the chiefs of the people, and all the people of the land, and they conducted the king into the house of the Lord; and he went through the inner gate into the king's house, and they seated the king on the throne of the kingdom. 2 Chronicles 23:21 And all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet: and they slew Gotholia. 2 Chronicles 24:1 ¶ Joas was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Sabia of Bersabee. 2 Chronicles 24:2 And Joas did that which right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jodae the priest. 2 Chronicles 24:3 And Jodae took to himself two wives, and they bore sons and daughters. 2 Chronicles 24:4 And it came to pass afterward that it came into the heart of Joas to repair the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 24:5 And he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out into the cities of Juda, and collect money of all Israel to repair the house of the Lord from year to year, and make haste to speak of it. But the Levites hasted not. 2 Chronicles 24:6 And king Joas called Jodae the chief, and said to him, Why hast thou not looked after the Levites, so that they should bring from Juda and Jerusalem that which was prescribed by Moses the man of God, when he assembled Israel at the tabernacle of witness? 2 Chronicles 24:7 For Gotholia was a transgressor, and her sons tore down the house of God; for they offered the holy things of the house of the Lord to Baalim. 2 Chronicles 24:8 And the king said, Let a box be made, and let it be put at the gate of the house of the Lord without. 2 Chronicles 24:9 And let men proclaim in Juda an in Jerusalem, that the people should bring to the Lord, as Moses the servant of God spoke concerning Israel in the wilderness. 2 Chronicles 24:10 And all the princes and all the people gave, and brought in, and cast into the box until it was filled. 2 Chronicles 24:11 And it came to pass, when they brought in the box to the officers of the king by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that the money was more than sufficient, then came the king's scribe, and the officer of the high priest, and emptied the box, and restored it to its place. Thus they did day by day, and collected much money. 2 Chronicles 24:12 And the king and Jodae the priest gave it to the workmen employed in the service of the house of the Lord, and they hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord, also smiths and braziers to repair the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 24:13 And the workmen wrought, and the works prospered in their hands, and they established the house of the Lord on its foundation, and strengthened it. 2 Chronicles 24:14 And when they had finished it, they brought to the king and to Jodae the remainder of the money, and they made vessels for the house of the Lord, vessels of service for whole-burnt-offerings, and gold and silver censers: and they offered up whole-burnt-offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Jodae. 2 Chronicles 24:15 ¶ And Jodae grew old, being full of days, and he died, being a hundred and thirty years old at his death. 2 Chronicles 24:16 And they buried him with the kings in the city of David, because he had dealt well with Israel, and with God and his house. 2 Chronicles 24:17 And it came to pass after the death of Jodae, that the princes of Juda went in, and did obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened to them. 2 Chronicles 24:18 And they forsook the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and served the Astartes and idols: and there was wrath upon Juda and Jerusalem in that day. 2 Chronicles 24:19 yet he sent prophets to them, to turn them to the Lord; but they hearkened not: and he testified to them, but they obeyed not. 2 Chronicles 24:20 And the Spirit of God came upon Azarias the son of Jodae the priest, and he stood up above the people, and said, Thus saith the Lord, Why do ye transgress the commandments of the Lord? so shall ye not prosper; for ye have forsaken the Lord, and he will forsake you. 2 Chronicles 24:21 And they conspired against him, and stone him by command of king Joas in the court of the Lord's house. 2 Chronicles 24:22 So Joas remembered not the kindness which his father Jodae had exercised towards him, but slew his son. And as he died, he said, The Lord look upon it, and judge. 2 Chronicles 24:23 And it came to pass after the end of the year, that the host of Syria went up against him, and came against Juda and Jerusalem: and they slew all the chiefs of the people among the people, and all their spoils they sent to the king of Damascus. 2 Chronicles 24:24 For the army of Syria came with few men, yet God gave into their hands a very large army, because they had forsaken the God of their fathers; and he brought judgments on Joas. 2 Chronicles 24:25 And after they had departed from him, when they had left him in sore diseases, then his servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jodae the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchre of the kings. 2 Chronicles 24:26 And they that conspired against him were Zabed the son of Samaath the Ammanite, and Jozabed the son of Samareth the Moabite. 2 Chronicles 24:27 And all his sons, and the five came to him: and the other matters, behold, they are written in the book of the kings. And Amasias his son reigned in his stead. 2 Chronicles 25:1 ¶ Amasias began to reign when he was twenty and five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Joadaen of Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 25:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart. 2 Chronicles 25:3 And it came to pass, when the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father. 2 Chronicles 25:4 But he slew not their sons, according to the covenant of the law of the Lord, as it is written, and as the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, and the sons shall not die for the fathers, but they shall die each for his own sin. 2 Chronicles 25:5 And Amasias assembled the house of Juda, and appointed them according to the houses of their families for captains of thousands and captains of hundreds in all Juda and Jerusalem: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upwards, and found them three hundred thousand able to go out to war, holding spear and shield. 2 Chronicles 25:6 Also he hired of Israel a hundred thousand mighty men for a hundred talents of silver. 2 Chronicles 25:7 And there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the host of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, even all the sons of Ephraim. 2 Chronicles 25:8 For if thou shalt undertake to strengthen thyself with these, then the lord shall put thee to flight before the enemies: for it is of the Lord both to strengthen and to put to flight. 2 Chronicles 25:9 And Amasias said to the man of God, But what shall I do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God said, The Lord can give thee much more than these. 2 Chronicles 25:10 And Amasias separated from the army that came to him from Ephraim, that they might go away to their place; and they were very angry with Juda, and they returned to their place with great wrath. 2 Chronicles 25:11 And Amasias strengthened himself, and took his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote there the children of Seir ten thousand. 2 Chronicles 25:12 And the children of Juda took ten thousand prisoners, and they carried them to the top of the precipice, and cast them headlong from the top of the precipice, and they were all dashed to pieces. 2 Chronicles 25:13 And the men of the host whom Amasias sent back so that they should not go with him to battle, went and attacked the cities of Juda, from Samaria to Baethoron; and they smote three thousand among them, and took much spoil. 2 Chronicles 25:14 ¶ And it came to pass, after Amasias had returned from smiting Idumea, that he brought home the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up for himself as gods, and bowed down before them, and he sacrificed to them. 2 Chronicles 25:15 And the anger of the Lord came upon Amasias, and he sent him a prophet, and he said to him, Why hast thou sought the gods of the people, which have not rescued their own people out of thine hand? 2 Chronicles 25:16 And it came to pass when the prophet was speaking to him, that he said to him, have I made thee king's counsellor? take heed lest thou be scourged: and the prophet forebore, and said, I know that God is disposed against thee to destroy thee, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not hearkened to my counsel. 2 Chronicles 25:17 ¶ And Amasias king of Juda took counsel, and sent to Joas, son of Joachaz, son of Jeu, king of Israel, saying, Come, and let us look one another in the face. 2 Chronicles 25:18 And Joas king of Israel sent to Amasias king of Juda, saying, The thistle that was in Libanus sent to the cedar that was in Libanus, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife; but, behold, thy wild beasts of the field that are in Libanus shall come: and the wild beasts did come, and trod down the thistle. 2 Chronicles 25:19 Thou hast said, Behold, I have smitten Idumea, and thy stout heart exalts thee: now stay at home; for why dost thou implicate thyself in mischief, that thou shouldest fall, and Juda with thee. 2 Chronicles 25:20 Nevertheless Amasias hearkened not, for it was of the Lord to deliver him into the enemy's hands, because he sought after the gods of the Idumeans. 2 Chronicles 25:21 So Joas king of Israel went up; and they saw one another, he and Amasias king of Juda, in Baethsamys, which is of Juda. 2 Chronicles 25:22 And Juda was put to flight before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent. 2 Chronicles 25:23 And Joas king of Israel took prisoner Amasias king of Juda, son of Joas, son of Joachaz, in Baethsamys, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he pulled down part of the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 2 Chronicles 25:24 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord and with Abdedom, and the treasures of the king's house, and the hostages, and he returned to Samaria. 2 Chronicles 25:25 And Amasias the son of Joas king of Juda lived after the death of Joas the son of Joachaz king of Israel fifteen years. 2 Chronicles 25:26 And the rest of the acts of Amasias, the first and the last, Lo! are they not written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel? 2 Chronicles 25:27 And at the time when Amasias departed from the Lord, then they formed a conspiracy against him; and he fled from Jerusalem to Lachis: and they sent after him to Lachis, and slew him there. 2 Chronicles 25:28 And they took him up on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of David. 2 Chronicles 26:1 ¶ Then all the people of the land took Ozias, and he was sixteen years old, and they made him king in the room of his father Amasias. 2 Chronicles 26:2 He built Aelath, he recovered it to Juda, after the king slept with his fathers. 2 Chronicles 26:3 Ozias began to reign at the age of sixteen years, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechelia of Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 26:4 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Amasias his father did. 2 Chronicles 26:5 And he sought the Lord in the days of Zacharias, who understood the fear of the Lord; and in his days he sought the Lord, and the Lord prospered him. 2 Chronicles 26:6 And he went out and fought against the Philistines, and pulled down the walls of Geth, and the walls of Jabner, and the walls of Azotus, and he built cities near Azotus, and among the Philistines. 2 Chronicles 26:7 And the Lord strengthened him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt on the rock, and against the Minaeans. 2 Chronicles 26:8 And the Minaeans gave gifts to Ozias; and his fame spread as far as the entering in of Egypt, for he strengthened himself exceedingly. 2 Chronicles 26:9 And Ozias built towers in Jerusalem, both at the gate of the corners, and at the valley gate, and at the corners and he fortified them. 2 Chronicles 26:10 And he built towers in the wilderness, and dug many wells, for he had many cattle in the low country and in the plain; and vinedressers in the mountain country and in Carmel: for he was a husbandman. 2 Chronicles 26:11 And Ozias had a host of warriors, and that went out orderly to war, and returned orderly in number; and their number was made by the hand of Jeiel the scribe, and Maasias the judge, by the hand of Ananias the king's deputy. 2 Chronicles 26:12 The whole number of the chiefs of families of the mighty men of war was two thousand six hundred; 2 Chronicles 26:13 and with them was a warrior force, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred: these waged war mightily to help the king against his enemies. 2 Chronicles 26:14 And Ozias prepared for them, even for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and breastplates, and bows, and slings for stones. 2 Chronicles 26:15 And he made in Jerusalem machines invented by a wise contriver, to be upon the towers and upon the corners, to cast darts and great stones: and the fame of their preparation was heard at a distance; for he was wonderfully helped, till he was strong. 2 Chronicles 26:16 ¶ And when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction; and he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple of the Lord to turn incense on the altar of incense. 2 Chronicles 26:17 And there went in after him Azarias the priest, and with him eighty priests of the Lord, mighty men. 2 Chronicles 26:18 And they withstood Ozias the king, and said to him, It is not for thee, Ozias, to burn incense to the Lord, but only for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to sacrifice: go forth of the sanctuary, for thou hast departed from the Lord; and this shall not be for glory to thee from the Lord god. 2 Chronicles 26:19 And Ozias was angry, and in his hand was the censer to burn incense in the temple: and when he was angry with the priests, then the leprosy rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord, over the altar of incense. 2 Chronicles 26:20 And Azarias the chief priest, and the other priests, turned to look at him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead; and they got him hastily out thence, for he also hasted to go out, because the Lord had rebuked him. 2 Chronicles 26:21 And Ozias the king was a leper to the day of his death, and he dwelt as a leper in a separate house; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord: and Joathan his son was set over his kingdom, judging the people of the land. 2 Chronicles 26:22 And the rest of the acts of Ozias, the first and the last, are written by Jessias the prophet. 2 Chronicles 26:23 And Ozias slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial place of the kings, for they said, He is a leper; and Joatham his son reigned in his stead. 2 Chronicles 27:1 ¶ Joatham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jerusa, daughter of Sadoc. 2 Chronicles 27:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Ozias did: but he went not into the temple of the Lord. And still the people corrupted themselves. 2 Chronicles 27:3 He built the high gate of the house of the Lord, and he built much in the wall of Opel. 2 Chronicles 27:4 In the mountain of Juda, and in the woods, he built both dwelling-places and towers. 2 Chronicles 27:5 He fought against the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against him: and the children of Ammon gave him even annually a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. These the king of the children of Ammon brought to him annually in the first and second and third years. 2 Chronicles 27:6 Joatham grew strong, because he prepared his ways before the Lord his God. 2 Chronicles 27:7 And the rest of the acts of Joatham, and his war, and his deeds, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel. 2 Chronicles 27:8 2 Chronicles 27:9 And Joatham slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Achaz his son reigned in his stead. 2 Chronicles 28:1 ¶ Achaz was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord, as David his father. 2 Chronicles 28:2 But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, for he made graven images. 2 Chronicles 28:3 And he sacrificed to their idols in the valley of Benennom, and passed his children through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel. 2 Chronicles 28:4 And he burnt incense upon the high places, and upon the roofs, and under every shady tree. 2 Chronicles 28:5 And the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and he smote him, and took captive of them a great band of prisoners, and carried him to Damascus. Also God delivered him into the hands of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter. 2 Chronicles 28:6 ¶ And Phakee the son of Romelias king of Israel, slew in Juda in one day a hundred and twenty thousand mighty men; because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers. 2 Chronicles 28:7 And Zechri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maasias the king's son, and Ezrican the chief of his house, and Elcana the king's deputy. 2 Chronicles 28:8 And the children of Israel took captive of their brethren three hundred thousand, women, and sons, and daughters, and they spoiled them of much property, and brought the spoils to Samaria. 2 Chronicles 28:9 And there was there a prophet of the Lord, his name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that were coming to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, the wrath of the Lord God of your fathers is upon Juda, and he has delivered them into your hands, and ye have slain them in wrath, and it has reached even to heaven. 2 Chronicles 28:10 And now ye talk of keeping the children of Juda and Jerusalem for servants and handmaidens. Lo, am I not with you to testify for the Lord your God? 2 Chronicles 28:11 And now hearken to me, and restore the prisoners of your brethren whom ye have taken: for the fierce anger of the Lord is upon you. 2 Chronicles 28:12 And the chiefs of the sons of Ephraim rose up, Udias the son of Joanas, and Barachias the son of Mosolamoth, and Ezekias the son of Sellem, and Amasias the son of Eldai, against those that came from the war, 2 Chronicles 28:13 and said to them, Ye shall not bring in hither the prisoners to us, for whereas sin against the Lord is upon us, ye mean to add to our sins, and to our trespass: for our sin is great, and the fierce anger of the Lord is upon Israel. 2 Chronicles 28:14 So the warriors left the prisoners and the spoils before the princes and all the congregation. 2 Chronicles 28:15 And the men who were called by name rose up, and took hold of the prisoners, and clothed all the naked from the spoils, and gave them garments and shoes, and gave them food to eat, and oil to anoint themselves with, and they helped also every one that was weak with asses, and placed them in Jericho, the city of palm-trees, with their brethren; and they returned to Samaria. 2 Chronicles 28:16 ¶ At that time king Achaz sent to the king of Assyria to help him, and on this occasion, 2 Chronicles 28:17 because the Idumeans had attacked him, and smitten Juda, and taken a number of prisoners. 2 Chronicles 28:18 Also the Philistines had made an attack on the cities of the plain country, and the cities of the south of Juda, and taken Baethsamys, and [[the things in the house of the Lord, and the things in the house of the king, and of the princes: and they gave to the king]] Aelon, and Galero, and Socho and her villages, and Thamna and her villages, and Gamzo and her villages: and they dwelt there. 2 Chronicles 28:19 For the Lord humbled Juda because of Achaz king of Juda, because he grievously departed from the Lord. 2 Chronicles 28:20 And there came against him Thalgaphellasar king of Assyria, and he afflicted him. 2 Chronicles 28:21 And Achaz took the things that were in the house of the Lord, and the things in the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave them to the king of Assyria: but he was no help to him, 2 Chronicles 28:22 but only troubled him in his affliction: and he departed yet more from the Lord, and king Achaz said, 2 Chronicles 28:23 I will seek after the gods of Damascus that smite me. And he said, Forasmuch as the gods of the king of Syria themselves strengthen them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, and they will help me. But they became a stumbling-block to him, and to all Israel. 2 Chronicles 28:24 And Achaz removed the vessels of the house of the Lord, and cut them in pieces, and shut the doors of the house of the Lord, and made to himself altars in every corner in Jerusalem: 2 Chronicles 28:25 and in each several city in Juda he made high places to burn incense to strange gods: and they provoked the Lord God of their fathers. 2 Chronicles 28:26 And the rest of his acts, and his deeds, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel. 2 Chronicles 28:27 And Achaz slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David; for they did not bring him into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Ezekias his son reigned in his stead. 2 Chronicles 29:1 ¶ And Ezekias began to reign at the age of twenty-five years, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abia, daughter of Zacharias. 2 Chronicles 29:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father David had done. 2 Chronicles 29:3 And it came to pass, when he was established over his kingdom, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the Lord, and repaired them. 2 Chronicles 29:4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and put them on the east side, 2 Chronicles 29:5 and said to them, Hear, ye Levites: now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and cast out the impurity from the holy places. 2 Chronicles 29:6 For our fathers have revolted, and done that which was evil before the Lord our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their face from the tabernacle of the Lord, and have turned their back. 2 Chronicles 29:7 And they have shut up the doors of the temple, and put out the lamps, and have not burnt incense, and have not offered whole-burnt-offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel. 2 Chronicles 29:8 And the Lord was very angry with Juda and Jerusalem, and made them an astonishment, and a desolation, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes. 2 Chronicles 29:9 And, behold, your fathers have been smitten with the sword, and your sons and your daughters and your wives are in captivity in a land not their own, as it is even now. 2 Chronicles 29:10 Therefore it is now in my heart to make a covenant, a covenant with the Lord God of Israel, that he may turn away his fierce wrath from us. 2 Chronicles 29:11 And now be not wanting to your duty, for the Lord has chosen you to stand before him to minister, and to be ministers and burners of incense to him. 2 Chronicles 29:12 ¶ Then the Levites rose up, Maath the son of Amasi, and Joel the son of Azarias, of the sons of Caath: and of the sons of Merari, Kis the son of Abdi, and Azarias the son of Haelel: and of the sons of Gedsoni, Jodaad the son of Zemmath, and Joadam: these were the sons of Joacha. 2 Chronicles 29:13 And of the sons of Elisaphan; Zambri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zacharias, and Matthanias: 2 Chronicles 29:14 and of the sons of Aeman; Jeiel, and Semei: and of the sons of Idithun; Samaisa, and Oziel. 2 Chronicles 29:15 And they gathered their brethren, and they purified themselves according to the king's command by the order of the Lord, to purify the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 29:16 And the priests entered into the house of the Lord, to purify it, and they cast out all the uncleanness that was found in the house of the Lord, even into the court of the house of the Lord: and the Levites received it to cast into the brook of Kedron without. 2 Chronicles 29:17 And Ezekias began on the first day, even on the new moon of the first month, to purify, and on the eighth day of the month they entered into the temple of the Lord: and they purified the house of the Lord in eight days; and on the thirteenth day of the first month they finished the work. 2 Chronicles 29:18 And they went in to king Ezekias, and said, We have purified all the things in the house of the Lord, the altar of whole-burnt-offering, and its vessels, and the table of shew-bread, and its vessels; 2 Chronicles 29:19 and all the vessels which king Achaz polluted in his reign, in his apostasy, we have prepared and purified: behold, they are before the altar of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 29:20 ¶ And kin Ezekias rose early in the morning, and gathered the chief men of the city, and went up to the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 29:21 And he brought seven calves, seven rams, seven lambs, seven kids of goats for a sin-offering, for the kingdom, and for the holy things, and for Israel: and he told the priests the sons of Aaron to go up to the altar of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 29:22 And they slew the calves, and the priests received the blood, and poured it on the altar: and they slew the rams, and poured the blood upon the altar: also they slew the lambs, and poured the blood round the altar. 2 Chronicles 29:23 And they brought the goats for a sin-offering before the king and the congregation; and laid their hands upon them. 2 Chronicles 29:24 And the priests slew them, and offered their blood as a propitiation on the altar; and they made atonement for all Israel: for the king said, The whole-burnt-offering, and the sin-offering are for all Israel. 2 Chronicles 29:25 And he stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, and lutes, and harps, according to the commandment of king David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for by the commandment of the Lord the order was in the hand of the prophets. 2 Chronicles 29:26 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. 2 Chronicles 29:27 And Ezekias told them to offer up the whole-burnt-offering on the altar: and when they began to offer the whole-burnt-offering, they began to sing to the Lord, and the trumpets accompanied the instruments of David king of Israel. 2 Chronicles 29:28 And all the congregation worshipped, and the psalm-singers were singing, and the trumpets sounding, until the whole-burnt-sacrifice had been completely offered. 2 Chronicles 29:29 And when they had done offering it, the king and all that were present bowed, and worshipped. 2 Chronicles 29:30 And king Ezekias and the princes told the Levites to sing hymns to the Lord in the words of David, and of Asaph the prophet: and they sang hymns with gladness, and fell down and worshipped. 2 Chronicles 29:31 Then Ezekias answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves to the Lord, bring near and offer sacrifices of praise in the house of the Lord. And the congregation brought sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the Lord; and every one who was ready in his heart brought whole-burnt-offerings. 2 Chronicles 29:32 And the number of the whole-burnt-offerings which the congregation brought, was seventy calves, a hundred rams, two hundred lambs: all these were for a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord. 2 Chronicles 29:33 And the consecrated calves were six hundred, and the sheep three thousand. 2 Chronicles 29:34 But the priests were few, and could not flay the whole-burnt-offering, so their brethren the Levites helped them, until the work was finished, and until the priests had purified themselves: for the Levites more zealously purified themselves than the priests. 2 Chronicles 29:35 And the whole-burnt-offering was abundant, with the fat of the complete peace-offering, and the drink-offerings of the whole-burnt-sacrifice. So the service was established in the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 29:36 And Ezekias and all the people rejoiced, because God has prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly. 2 Chronicles 30:1 ¶ And Ezekias sent to all Israel and Juda, and wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasse, that they should come into the house of the Lord to Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the Lord God of Israel. 2 Chronicles 30:2 For the king, and the princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, designed to keep the passover in the second month. 2 Chronicles 30:3 For they could not keep it at that time, because a sufficient number of priest had not purified themselves, and the people was not gathered to Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 30:4 And the proposal pleased the king and the congregation. 2 Chronicles 30:5 And they established a decree that a proclamation should go through all Israel, from Bersabee to Dan, that they should come and keep the passover to the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem: for the multitude had not done it lately according to the scripture. 2 Chronicles 30:6 And the posts went with the letters from the king and the princes to all Israel and Juda, according to the command of the king, saying, Children of Israel, return to the Lord God of Abraam, and Isaac, and Israel, and bring back them that have escaped even those that were left of the hand of the king of Assyria. 2 Chronicles 30:7 And be not as your fathers, and your brethren, who revolted from the Lord God of their fathers, and he gave them up to desolation, as ye see. 2 Chronicles 30:8 And now harden not your hearts, as your fathers did: give glory to the Lord God, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord your God, and he shall turn away his fierce anger from you. 2 Chronicles 30:9 For when ye turn to the Lord, your brethren and your children shall be pitied before all that have carried them captives, and he will restore you to this land: for the Lord our God is merciful and pitiful, and will not turn away his face from you, if we return to him. 2 Chronicles 30:10 So the posts went through from city to city in mount Ephraim, and Manasse, and as far as Zabulon: and they as it were laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. 2 Chronicles 30:11 But the men of Aser, and some of Manasses and of Zabulon, were ashamed, and came to Jerusalem and Juda. 2 Chronicles 30:12 And the hand of the Lord was present to give them one heart to come, to do according to the commands of the king and of the princes, by the word of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 30:13 ¶ And a great multitude were gathered to Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. 2 Chronicles 30:14 And they arose, and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all on which they burnt incense to false gods they tore down and cast into the brook Kedron. 2 Chronicles 30:15 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites repented, and purified themselves, and brought whole-burnt-offerings into the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 30:16 And they stood at their post, according to their ordinance, according to the commandment of Moses the man of God: and the priests received the blood from the hand of the Levites. 2 Chronicles 30:17 For a great part of the congregation was not sanctified; and the Levites were ready to kill the passover for every one who could not sanctify himself to the Lord. 2 Chronicles 30:18 For the greatest part of the people of Ephraim, and Manasse, and Issachar, and Zabulon, had not purified themselves, but ate the passover contrary to the scripture. On this account also Ezekias prayed concerning them, saying, 2 Chronicles 30:19 The good Lord be merciful with regard to every heart that sincerely seeks the Lord God of their fathers, and is not purified according to the purification of the sanctuary. 2 Chronicles 30:20 And the Lord hearkened to Ezekias, and healed the people. 2 Chronicles 30:21 ¶ And the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great joy; and they continued to sing hymns to the Lord daily, and the priests and the Levites played on instruments to the Lord. 2 Chronicles 30:22 And Ezekias encouraged all the Levites, and those that had good understanding of the Lord: and they completely kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days, offering peace-offerings, and confessing to the Lord God of their fathers. 2 Chronicles 30:23 And the congregation purposed together to keep other seven days: and they kept seven days with gladness. 2 Chronicles 30:24 For Ezekias set apart for Juda, even for the congregation, a thousand calves and seven thousand sheep; and the princes set apart for the people a thousand calves and ten thousand sheep: and the holy things of the priests abundantly. 2 Chronicles 30:25 And all the congregation, the priests and the Levites, rejoiced, and all the congregation of Juda, and they that were present of Jerusalem, and the strangers that came from the land of Israel, and the dwellers in Juda. 2 Chronicles 30:26 And there was great joy in Jerusalem: from the days of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not such a feast in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 30:27 Then the priests the Levites rose up and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came into his holy dwelling-place, even into heaven. 2 Chronicles 31:1 ¶ And when all these things were finished, all Israel that were found in the cities of Juda went out, and broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the groves, and tore down the high places and the altars out of all Judea and Benjamin, also of Ephraim and Manasse, till they made an end: and all Israel returned, every one to his inheritance, and to their cities. 2 Chronicles 31:2 And Ezekias appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, and the courses of each one according to his ministry, to the priests and to the Levites, for the whole-burnt-offering, and for the peace-offering, and to praise, and to give thanks, and to minister in the gates, and in the courts of the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 31:3 And the king's proportion out of his substance was appointed for the whole-burnt-offerings, the morning and the evening one, and the whole-burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the feasts that were ordered in the law of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 31:4 And they told the people who dwelt in Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be strong in the ministry of the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 31:5 And as he gave the command, Israel brought abundantly first-fruits of corn, and wine, and oil, and honey, and every fruit of the field: and the children of Israel and Juda brought tithes of everything abundantly. 2 Chronicles 31:6 And they that dwelt in the cities of Juda themselves also brought tithes of calves and sheep, and tithes of goats, and consecrated them to the Lord their God, and they brought them and laid them in heaps. 2 Chronicles 31:7 In the third month the heaps began to be piled, and in the seventh month they were finished. 2 Chronicles 31:8 And Ezekias and the princes came and saw the heaps, and blessed the Lord, and his people Israel. 2 Chronicles 31:9 Then Ezekias enquired of the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. 2 Chronicles 31:10 And Azarias the priest, the chief over the house of Sadoc, spoke to him, and said, From the time that the first-fruits began to be brought into the house of the Lord, we have eaten and drunk, and left even abundantly; for the Lord has blessed his people, and we have left to this amount. 2 Chronicles 31:11 ¶ And Ezekias told them yet farther to prepare chambers for the house of the Lord; and they prepared them, 2 Chronicles 31:12 and they brought thither the first-fruits and the tithes faithfully: and Chonenias the Levite was superintendent over them, and Semei his brother was next. 2 Chronicles 31:13 and Jeiel, and Ozias, and Naeth, and Asael, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Samachia, and Maath, and Banaias, and his sons, were appointed by Chonenias and Semei his brother, as Ezekias the king, and Azarias who was over the house of the Lord commanded. 2 Chronicles 31:14 And Core, the son of Jemna the Levite, the porter eastward, was over the gifts, to distribute the first-fruits of the Lord, and the most holy things, 2 Chronicles 31:15 by the hand of Odom, and Benjamin, and Jesus, and Semei, and Amarias, and Sechonias, by the hand of the priests faithfully, to give to their brethren according to the courses, as well to great as small; 2 Chronicles 31:16 besides the increase of males from three years old and upward, to every one entering into the house of the Lord, a portion according to a daily rate, for service in the daily courses of their order. 2 Chronicles 31:17 This is the distribution of the priests according to the houses of their families; and the Levites in their daily courses from twenty years old and upward were in their order, 2 Chronicles 31:18 to assign stations for all the increase of their sons and their daughters, for the whole number: for they faithfully sanctified the holy place. 2 Chronicles 31:19 As for the sons of Aaron that executed the priests' office,-even those from their cities the men in each several city who were named expressly,-were appointed to give a portion to every male among the priests, and to every one reckoned among the Levites. 2 Chronicles 31:20 And Ezekias did so through all Juda, and did that which was good and right before the Lord his God. 2 Chronicles 31:21 And in every work which he began in service in the house of the Lord, and in the law, and in the ordinances, he sought his God with all his soul, and wrought, and prospered. 2 Chronicles 32:1 ¶ And after these things and this faithful dealing, came Sennacherim king of the Assyrians, and he came to Juda, and encamped against the fortified cities, and intended to take them for himself. 2 Chronicles 32:2 And Ezekias saw that Sennacherim was come, and that his face was set to fight against Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 32:3 And he took counsel with his elders and his mighty men to stop the wells of water which were without the city: and they helped him. 2 Chronicles 32:4 And he collected many people, and stopped the wells of water, and the river that flowed through the city, saying, Lest the king of Assyria come, and find much water, and strengthen himself. 2 Chronicles 32:5 And Ezekias strengthened himself, and built all the wall that had been pulled down, and the towers, and another wall in front without, and fortified the strong place of the city of David, and prepared arms in abundance. 2 Chronicles 32:6 And he appointed captains of war over the people, and they were gathered to meet him to the open place of the gate of the valley, and he encouraged them, saying, 2 Chronicles 32:7 Be strong and courageous, and fear not, neither be dismayed before the King of Assyria, and before all the nation that is with him: for there are more with us than with him. 2 Chronicles 32:8 With him are arms of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to save us, and to fight our battle. And the people were encouraged at the words of Ezekias king of Juda. 2 Chronicles 32:9 ¶ And afterward Sennacherim king of the Assyrians sent his servants to Jerusalem; and he went himself against Lachis, and all his army with him, and sent to Ezekias king of Juda, and to all Juda that was in Jerusalem, saying, 2 Chronicles 32:10 Thus says Sennacherim king of the Assyrians, On what do ye trust, that ye will remain in the siege in Jerusalem? 2 Chronicles 32:11 Does not Ezekias deceive you, to deliver you to death and famine and thirst, saying, The Lord our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 2 Chronicles 32:12 Is not this Ezekias who has taken down his altars and his high places and has spoken to Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before this altar and burn incense upon it? 2 Chronicles 32:13 Know ye not what I and my fathers have done to all the nations of the countries? Could the gods of the nations of all the earth at all rescue their people out of my hand? 2 Chronicles 32:14 Who is there among all the gods of those nations whom my fathers utterly destroyed, worthy of trust? Could they deliver their people out of my hand, that your God should deliver you out of my hand? 2 Chronicles 32:15 Now then, let not Ezekias deceive you, and let him not make you thus confident, and believe him not: for no god of any kingdom or nation is at all able to deliver his people out of my hand, or the hand of my fathers: therefore your God shall not deliver you out of my hand. 2 Chronicles 32:16 And his servants continued to speak against the Lord God, and against his servant Ezekias. 2 Chronicles 32:17 And he wrote a letter to reproach the Lord God of Israel, and spoke concerning him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the earth have not delivered their people out of my hand, so the God of Ezekias shall by no means deliver his people out of my hand. 2 Chronicles 32:18 And he cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem on the wall, calling them to assist them, and pull down the walls, that they might take the city. 2 Chronicles 32:19 And he spoke against the God of Jerusalem, even as against the gods of the nations of the earth, the works of the hands of men. 2 Chronicles 32:20 And king Ezekias and Esaias the prophet the son of Amos prayed concerning these things, and they cried to heaven. 2 Chronicles 32:21 And the Lord sent an angel, and he destroyed every mighty man and warrior, and leader and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria: and he returned with shame of face to his own land and came into the house of his god: and some of them that came out of his bowels slew him with the sword. 2 Chronicles 32:22 So the Lord delivered Ezekias and the dwellers in Jerusalem out of the hand of Sennacherim King of Assyria, and out of the hand of all his enemies, and gave them rest round about. 2 Chronicles 32:23 And many brought gifts to the Lord to Jerusalem, and presents to Ezekias king of Juda; and he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations after these things. 2 Chronicles 32:24 ¶ In those days Ezekias was sick even to death, and prayed to the Lord: and he hearkened to him, and gave him a sign. 2 Chronicles 32:25 But Ezekias did not recompense the Lord according to the return which he made him, but his heart was lifted up: and wrath came upon him, and upon Juda and Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 32:26 And Ezekias humbled himself after the exaltation of his heart, he and the dwellers in Jerusalem; and the wrath of the Lord did not come upon them in the days of Ezekias. 2 Chronicles 32:27 And Ezekias had wealth and very great glory: and he made for himself treasuries of gold, and silver, and precious stones, also for spices, and stores for arms, and for precious vessels; 2 Chronicles 32:28 and cities for the produce of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls and mangers for every kind of cattle, and folds for flocks; 2 Chronicles 32:29 and cities which he built for himself, and store of sheep and oxen in abundance, for the Lord gave him a very great store. 2 Chronicles 32:30 The same Ezekias stopped up the course of the water of Gion above, and brought the water down straight south of the city of David. And Ezekias prospered in all his works. 2 Chronicles 32:31 Notwithstanding, in regard to the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who were sent to him to enquire of him concerning the prodigy which came upon the land, the Lord left him, to try him, to know what was in his heart. 2 Chronicles 32:32 And the rest of the acts of Ezekias, and his kindness, behold, they are written in the prophecy of Esaias the son of Amos the prophet, and in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel. 2 Chronicles 32:33 And Ezekias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in a high place among the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem gave him glory and honour at his death. And Manasses his son reigned in his stead. 2 Chronicles 33:1 ¶ Manasses was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 33:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord destroyed from before the face of the children of Israel. 2 Chronicles 33:3 And he returned and built the high places, which his father Ezekias had pulled down, and set up images to Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 2 Chronicles 33:4 And he built altars in the house of the Lord, concerning which the Lord said, In Jerusalem shall be my name for ever. 2 Chronicles 33:5 And he built altars to all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 33:6 He also passed his children through the fire in the valley of Benennom; and he divined, and used auspices, and sorceries, and appointed those who had divining spirits, and enchanters, and wrought abundant wickedness before the Lord, to provoke him. 2 Chronicles 33:7 And he set the graven image, the molten statue, the idol which he made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name for ever; 2 Chronicles 33:8 and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I gave to their fathers, if only they will take heed to do all things which I have commanded them, according to all the law and the ordinances and the judgments given by the hand of Moses. 2 Chronicles 33:9 So Manasses led astray Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to do evil beyond all the nations which the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel. 2 Chronicles 33:10 And the Lord spoke to Manasses, and to his people: but they hearkened not. 2 Chronicles 33:11 ¶ And the Lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, and they took Manasses in bonds, and bound him in fetters, and brought him to Babylon. 2 Chronicles 33:12 And when he was afflicted, he sought the face of the Lord his God, and was greatly humbled before the face of the God of his fathers; 2 Chronicles 33:13 and he prayed to him: and he hearkened to him, and listened to his cry, and brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom: and Manasses knew that the Lord he is God. 2 Chronicles 33:14 And afterward he built a wall without the city of David, from the southwest southward in the valleys and at the entrance through the fish-gate, as men go out by the gate round about, even as far as Opel: and he raised it much, and set captains of the host in all the fortified cities in Juda. 2 Chronicles 33:15 And he removed the strange gods, and the graven image out of the house of the Lord, and all the altars which he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord, and in Jerusalem, and without the city. 2 Chronicles 33:16 And he repaired the altar of the Lord, and offered upon it a sacrifice of peace-offering and thank- offering, and he told Juda to serve the Lord God of Israel. 2 Chronicles 33:17 Nevertheless the people still sacrificed on the high places, only to the Lord their God. 2 Chronicles 33:18 And the rest of the acts of Manasses, and his prayer to God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the God of Israel, 2 Chronicles 33:19 behold, they are in the account of his prayer; and God hearkened to him. And all his sins, and his backslidings, and the spots on which he built the high places, and set there groves and graven images, before he repented, behold, they are written in the books of the seers. 2 Chronicles 33:20 And Manasses slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the garden of his house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. 2 Chronicles 33:21 ¶ Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 33:22 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasses did: and Amon sacrificed to all the idols which his father Manasses had made, and served them. 2 Chronicles 33:23 And he was not humbled before the Lord as his father Manasses was humbled; for his son Amon abounded in transgression. 2 Chronicles 33:24 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his house. 2 Chronicles 33:25 And the people of the land slew the men who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josias his son king in his stead. 2 Chronicles 34:1 ¶ Josias was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 34:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of his father David, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. 2 Chronicles 34:3 And in the eighth year of his reign, and he being yet a youth, he began to seek the Lord God of his father David: and in the twelfth year of his reign he began to purge Juda and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the ornaments for the altars, and the molten images. 2 Chronicles 34:4 And he pulled down the altars of Baalim that were before his face, and the high places that were above them; and he cut down the groves, and the graven images, and broke in pieces the molten images, and reduced them to powder, and cast it upon the surface of the tombs of those who had sacrificed to them. 2 Chronicles 34:5 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon the altars, and purged Juda and Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 34:6 And he did so in the cities of Manasse, and Ephraim, and Symeon, and Nephthali, and the places round about them. 2 Chronicles 34:7 And he pulled down the altars and the groves, and he cut the idols in small pieces, and cut off all the high places from all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 34:8 ¶ And in the eighteenth year of his reign, after having cleansed the land, and the house, he sent Saphan the son of Ezelias, and Maasa prefect of the city, and Juach son of Joachaz his recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his God. 2 Chronicles 34:9 And they came to Chelcias the high priest, and gave the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites who kept the gate collected of the hand of Manasse and Ephraim, and of the princes, and of every one that was left in Israel, and of the children of Juda and Benjamin, and of the dwellers in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 34:10 And they gave it into the hand of the workmen, who were appointed in the house of the Lord, and they gave it to the workmen who wrought in the house of the Lord, to repair and strengthen the house. 2 Chronicles 34:11 They gave it also to the carpenters and builders, to buy squared stones, and timber for beams to cover the houses which the kings of Juda had destroyed. 2 Chronicles 34:12 And the men were faithfully engaged in the works: and over them were superintendents, Jeth and Abdias, Levites of the sons of Merari, and Zacharias and Mosollam, of the sons of Caath, appointed to oversee; and every Levite, and every one that understood how to play on musical instruments. 2 Chronicles 34:13 And overseers were over the burden-bearers, and over all the workmen in the respective works; and of the Levites were appointed scribes, and judges, and porters. 2 Chronicles 34:14 ¶ And when they brought forth the money that had been brought into the house of the Lord, Chelcias the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by the hand of Moses. 2 Chronicles 34:15 And Chelcias answered and said to Saphan the scribe, I have found a book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Chelcias gave the book to Saphan. 2 Chronicles 34:16 And Saphan brought in the book to the king, and moreover gave an account to the king, saying, This is all the money given into the hand of thy servants that work. 2 Chronicles 34:17 And they have collected the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and given it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of them that do the work. 2 Chronicles 34:18 And Saphan the scribe brought word to the king, saying, Chelcias the priest has given me a book. And Saphan read it before the king. 2 Chronicles 34:19 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the law, that he rent his garments. 2 Chronicles 34:20 And the king commanded Chelcias, and Achicam the son of Saphan, and Abdom the son of Michaias, and Saphan the scribe, and Asia the servant of the king, saying, 2 Chronicles 34:21 Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for every one that is left in Israel and Juda, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord which has been kindled amongst us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of the Lord, to do according to all the things written in this book. 2 Chronicles 34:22 And Chelcias went, and the others whom the king told, to Olda the prophetess, the wife of Sellem son of Thecoe, son of Aras, who kept the commandments; and she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter: and they spoke to her accordingly. 2 Chronicles 34:23 And she said to them, Thus has the Lord God of Israel said, Tell the man who sent you to me, 2 Chronicles 34:24 Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I bring evil upon this place, even all the words that are written in the book that was read before the king of Juda: 2 Chronicles 34:25 because they have forsaken me, and burnt incense to strange gods, that they might provoke me by all the works of their hands; and my wrath is kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched. 2 Chronicles 34:26 And concerning the king of Juda, who sent you to seek the Lord,-thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, As for the words which thou has heard, 2 Chronicles 34:27 forasmuch as thy heart was ashamed, and thou was humbled before me when thou heardest my words against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, and thou wast humbled before me, and didst rend thy garments, and didst weep before me; I also have heard, saith the Lord. 2 Chronicles 34:28 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, and thine eyes shall not look upon all the evils which I am bringing upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of it. And they brought back word to the king. 2 Chronicles 34:29 ¶ And the king sent and gathered the elders of Juda and Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 34:30 And the king went up to the house of the Lord, he and all Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that were found in the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 34:31 And the king stood at a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk before the Lord, to keep his commandments and testimonies, and his ordinances, with all his heart and with all his soul, so as to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book. 2 Chronicles 34:32 And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand; and the inhabitants of Jerusalem made a covenant in the house of the Lord God of their fathers. 2 Chronicles 34:33 And Josias removed all the abominations out of the whole land which belonged to the children of Israel, and caused all that were found in Jerusalem and in Israel, to serve the Lord their God all his days: he departed not from following the Lord God of his fathers. 2 Chronicles 35:1 ¶ And Josias kept a passover to the Lord his God; and sacrificed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. 2 Chronicles 35:2 And he appointed the priests at their charges, and encouraged them for the services of the house of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 35:3 And he told the Levites that were able to act in all Israel, that they should consecrate themselves to the Lord: and they put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built: and the king said, Ye must not carry anything on your shoulders: now then minister to the Lord your God, and to his people Israel. 2 Chronicles 35:4 And prepare yourselves according to the houses of your families, and according to your daily courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and the order by the hand of his son Solomon. 2 Chronicles 35:5 And stand ye in the house according to the divisions of the houses of your families for your brethren the sons of the people; so also let there be for the Levites a division of the house of their family. 2 Chronicles 35:6 And kill ye the passover, and prepare it for your brethren, to do according to the word of the Lord, by the hand of Moses. 2 Chronicles 35:7 And Josias gave as an offering to the children of the people, sheep, and lambs, and kids of the young of the goats, all for the passover, even for all that were found, in number amounting to thirty thousand, and three thousand calves, these were of the substance of the king. 2 Chronicles 35:8 And his princes gave an offering to the people, and to the priests, and to the Levites: and Chelcias and Zacharias and Jeiel the chief men gave to the priests of the house of God, they even gave for the passover sheep, and lambs, and kids, two thousand six hundred, and three hundred calves. 2 Chronicles 35:9 And Chonenias, and Banaeas, and Samaeas, and Nathanael his brother, and Asabias, and Jeiel, and Jozabad, heads of the Levites, gave an offering to the Levites for the passover, of five thousand sheep and five hundred calves. 2 Chronicles 35:10 And the service was duly ordered, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the command of the king. 2 Chronicles 35:11 And they slew the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hand, and the Levites flayed the victims. 2 Chronicles 35:12 And they prepared the whole-burnt-offering to give to them, according to the division by the houses of families, even to the sons of the people, to offer to the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses. 2 Chronicles 35:13 And thus they did till the morning. And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance; and boiled the holy pieces in copper vessels and caldrons, and the feast went on well, and they quickly served all the children of the people. 2 Chronicles 35:14 And after they had prepared for themselves and for the priests, for the priests were engaged in offering the whole-burnt-offerings and the fat until night, then the Levites prepared for themselves, and for their brethren the sons of Aaron. 2 Chronicles 35:15 And the sons of Asaph the psalm-singers were at their post according to the commands of David, and Asaph, and Aeman, and Idithom, the prophets of the king: also, the chiefs and the porters of the several gates;-it was not for them to stir from the service of the holy things, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them. 2 Chronicles 35:16 So all the service of the Lord was duly ordered and prepared in that day, for keeping the passover, and offering the whole-burnt-sacrifices on the altar of the Lord, according to the command of kin Josias. 2 Chronicles 35:17 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. 2 Chronicles 35:18 And there was no passover like it in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, or any king of Israel: they kept not such a passover as Josias, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Juda and Israel that were present, and the dwellers in Jerusalem, kept to the Lord. 2 Chronicles 35:19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias this passover was kept, after all these things that Josias"

I am not come to-day to war against thee; and God has told me to hasten: beware of the God that is with me, lest he destroy thee. 2 Chronicles 35:22 However, Josias turned not his face from him, but strengthened himself to fight against him, and hearkened not to the words of Nechao by the mouth of God, and he came to fight in the plain of Mageddo. 2 Chronicles 35:23 And the archers shot at king Josias; and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am severely wounded. 2 Chronicles 35:24 And his servants lifted him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot which he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried with his fathers: and all Juda and Jerusalem lamented over Josias. 2 Chronicles 35:25 And Jeremias mourned over Josias, and all the chief men and chief women uttered a lamentation over Josias until this day: and they made it an ordinance for Israel, and, behold, it is written in the lamentations. 2 Chronicles 35:26 And the rest of the acts of Josias, and his hope, are written in the law of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 35:27 And his acts, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 2 Chronicles 36:1 ¶ And the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias, and anointed him, and made him king over Jerusalem in the room of his father. 2 Chronicles 36:2 Joachaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in"

And Joakim slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in Ganozae: and Jechonias his son reigned in his stead. 2 Chronicles 36:9 Jechonias was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord. 2 Chronicles 36:10 And at the turn of the year, king Nabuchodonosor sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of the Lord, and made Sedekias his father's brother king over Juda and Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 36:11 ¶ Sedekias was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and be reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 36:12 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God: he was not ashamed before the prophet Jeremias, nor because of the word of the Lord; 2 Chronicles 36:13 in that he rebelled against king Nabuchodonosor, which he adjured him by God not to do: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart, so as not to return to the Lord God of Israel. 2 Chronicles 36:14 And all the great men of Juda, and the priests, and the people of the land transgressed abundantly in the abominations of the heathen, and polluted the house of the Lord which was in Jerusalem. 2 Chronicles 36:15 And the Lord God of their fathers sent by the hand of his prophets; rising early and sending his messengers, for he spared his people, and his sanctuary. 2 Chronicles 36:16 Nevertheless they sneered at his messengers, and set at nought his words, and mocked his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose up against his people, till there was no remedy. 2 Chronicles 36:17 And he brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, and slew their young men with the sword in the house of his sanctuary, and did not spare Sedekias, and had no mercy upon their virgins, and they led away their old men: he delivered all things into their hands. 2 Chronicles 36:18 And all the vessels of the house of God, the great and the small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord, and all the treasures of the king and the great men; he brought all to Babylon. 2 Chronicles 36:19 And he burnt the house of the Lord, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt its palaces with fire, and utterly destroyed every beautiful vessel. 2 Chronicles 36:20 And he carried away the remnant to Babylon; and they were servants to him and to his sons until the establishment of the kingdom of the Medes. 2 Chronicles 36:21 That the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias might be fulfilled, until the land should enjoy its sabbaths in resting and sabbath keeping all the days of its desolation, till the accomplishment of seventy years. 2 Chronicles 36:22 ¶ In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, after the fulfillment of the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians, and told him to make proclamation in writing throughout all his kingdom, saying, 2 Chronicles 36:23 Thus says Cyrus king of the Persians to all the kingdoms of the earth, The Lord God of heaven has given me power, and he has commanded me to build a house to him in Jerusalem, in Judea. Who is there of you of all his people? his God shall be with him, and let him go up. Ezra 1:1 ¶ Now in the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians, and he issued a proclamation through all his kingdom, and that in writing, saying, Ezra 1:2 Thus said Cyrus king of the Persians, The Lord God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has given me a charge to build him a house in Jerusalem that is in Judea. Ezra 1:3 Who is there among you of all his people? for his God shall be with him, and he shall go up to Jerusalem that is in Judea, and let him build the house of the God of Israel: he is the God that is in Jerusalem. Ezra 1:4 And let every Jew that is left go from every place where he sojourns, and the men of his place shall help him with silver, and gold, and goods, and cattle, together with the voluntary offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem. Ezra 1:5 ¶ Then the chiefs of the families of Juda and Benjamin arose, and the priests, and the Levites, all whose spirit the Lord stirred up to go up to build the house of the Lord that is in Jerusalem. Ezra 1:6 And all that were round about strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with cattle, and with presents, besides the voluntary offerings. Ezra 1:7 And king Cyrus brought out the vessels of the house of the Lord, which Nabuchodonosor had brought from Jerusalem, and put in the house of his god. Ezra 1:8 And Cyrus king of the Persians brought them out by the hand of Mithradates the treasurer, and he numbered them to Sasabasar, the chief man of Juda. Ezra 1:9 And this is their number: thirty gold basons, and a thousand silver basons, nine and twenty changes, thirty golden goblets, Ezra 1:10 and four hundred and ten double silver vessels, and a thousand other vessels. Ezra 1:11 All the gold and silver vessels were five thousand four hundred, even all that went up with Sasabasar from the place of transportation, from Babylon to Jerusalem."

Nehemiah 12:22 The Levites in the days of Eliasib, Joada, and Joa, and Joanan, and Idua, were recorded heads of families: also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian. Nehemiah 12:23 And the sons of Levi, heads of families, were written in the book of the chronicles, even to the days of Joanan son of Elisue. Nehemiah 12:24 And the heads of the Levites were Asabia, and Sarabia, and Jesu: and the sons of Cadmiel, and their brethren over against them, were to sing hymns of praise, according to the commandment of David the man of God, course by course. Nehemiah 12:25 When I gathered the porters, Nehemiah 12:26 it was in the days of Joakim son of Jesus, son of Josedec, and in the days of Neemia: and Esdras the priest was scribe. Nehemiah 12:27 ¶ And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites in their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep a feast of dedication and gladness with thanksgiving, and they sounded cymbals with songs, and had psalteries and harps. Nehemiah 12:28 And the sons of the singers were assembled both from the neighbourhood round about to Jerusalem, and from the villages, Nehemiah 12:29 and from the country: for the singers built themselves villages by Jerusalem. Nehemiah 12:30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people, and the porters, and the wall. Nehemiah 12:31 And they brought up the princes of Juda on the wall, and they appointed two great companies for thanksgiving, and they passed on the right hand on the wall of the dung-gate. Nehemiah 12:32 And after them went Osaia, and half the princes of Juda, Nehemiah 12:33 and Azarias, and Esdras, and Mesollam, Nehemiah 12:34 and Juda, and Benjamin, and Samaias and Jeremia. Nehemiah 12:35 And some of the sons of the priest with trumpets, Zacharias son of Jonathan, son of Samaias, son of Matthania, son of Michaia, son of Zacchur, son of Asaph: Nehemiah 12:36 and his brethren, Samaia, and Oziel, Gelol, Jama, Aia, Nathanael, and Juda, Anani, to praise with the hymns of David the man of God; (12:37) and Esdras the scribe was before them, Nehemiah 12:37 at the gate, to praise before them, and they went up by the steps of the city of David, in the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate Nehemiah 12:38 Nehemiah 12:39 of Ephraim, and to the fish-gate, and by the tower of Anameel, and as far as the sheep-gate. Nehemiah 12:40 Nehemiah 12:41 Nehemiah 12:42 And the singers were heard, and were numbered. Nehemiah 12:43 And in that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced; for God had made them very joyful: and their wives and their children rejoiced: and the joy in Jerusalem was heard from afar off. Nehemiah 12:44 ¶ And in that day they appointed men over the treasuries, for the treasures, the first-fruits, and the tithes, and for the chiefs of the cities who were assembled among them, to furnish portions for the priests and Levites: for there was joy in Juda over the priests and over the Levites that waited. Nehemiah 12:45 And they kept the charges of their God, and the charges of the purification, and ordered the singers and the porters, according to the commandments of David and his son Solomon. Nehemiah 12:46 For in the days of David Asaph was originally first of the singers, and they sang hymns and praise to God. Nehemiah 12:47 And all Israel in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of Neemias, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, a daily rate: and consecrated them to the Levites: and the Levites consecrated them to the sons of Aaron."

Esther 5:4 And Esther said, To-day is my great day: if then it seem good to the king, let both him and Aman come to the feast which I will prepare this day. Esther 5:5 And the king said, Hasten Aman hither, that we may perform the word of Esther. So they both come to the feast of which Esther had spoken. Esther 5:6 And at the banquet the king said to Esther, What is thy request, queen Esther? speak, and thou shalt have all that thou requirest. Esther 5:7 And she said, My request and my petition are: Esther 5:8 if I have found favour in the sight of the king, let the king and Aman come again to-morrow to the feast which I shall prepare for them, and to-morrow I will do the same. Esther 5:9 ¶ So Aman went out from the king very glad and merry: but when Aman saw Mardochaeus the Jew in the court, he was greatly enraged. Esther 5:10 And having gone into his own house, he called his friends, and his wife Zosara. Esther 5:11 And he shewed them his wealth, and the glory with which the king had invested him, and how he had caused him to take precedence and bear chief rule in the kingdom. Esther 5:12 And Aman said, The queen has called no one to the feast with the king but me, and I am invited to- morrow. Esther 5:13 But these things please me not, while I see Mardochaeus the Jew in the court.

And the saying pleased Aman, and the gallows was prepared."

If we have received good things of the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure evil things? In all these things that happened to him, Job sinned not at all with his lips before God. Job 2:11 ¶ Now his three friends having heard of all the evil that was come upon him, came to him each from his own country: Eliphaz the king of the Thaemans, Baldad sovereign of the Saucheans, Sophar king of he Minaeans: and they came to him with one accord, to comfort and to visit him. Job 2:12 And when they saw him from a distance they did not know him; and they cried with a loud voice, and wept, and rent every one his garment, and sprinkled dust upon their heads, Job 2:13 and they sat down beside him seven days and seven nights, and no one of them spoke; for they saw that his affliction was dreadful and very great."

Job 19:7 Behold, I laugh at reproach; I will not speak: or I will cry out, but there is nowhere judgment. Job 19:8 ¶ I am fenced round about, and can by no means escape: he has set darkness before my face. Job 19:9 And he has stripped me of my glory, and has taken the crown from my head. Job 19:10 He has torn me around about, and I am gone: and he has cut off my hope like a tree. Job 19:11 And he has dreadfully handled me in anger, and has counted me for an enemy. Job 19:12 His troops also came upon me with one accord, liars in wait compassed my ways. Job 19:13 My brethren have stood aloof from me; they have recognized strangers rather than me: and my friends have become pitiless. Job 19:14 My nearest of kin have not acknowledged me, and they that knew my name, have forgotten me. Job 19:15 As for my household, and my maid-servants, I was a stranger before them. Job 19:16 I called my servant, and he hearkened not; and my mouth intreated him. Job 19:17 And I besought my wife, and earnestly intreated the sons of my concubines.

Proverbs,8,21,"A) If I declare to you the things that daily happen, I will remember also to recount the things of old. Proverbs 8:22 ¶ The Lord made me the beginning of his ways for his works.

Proverbs 8:26 The Lord made countries and uninhabited tracks, and the highest inhabited parts of the world. Proverbs 8:27 When he prepared the heaven, I was present with him; and when he prepared his throne upon the winds: Proverbs 8:28 and when he strengthened the clouds above; and when he secured the fountains of the earth: Proverbs 8:29 and when he strengthened the foundations of the earth: Proverbs 8:30 I was by him, suiting myself to him, I was that wherein he took delight; and daily I rejoiced in his presence continually. Proverbs 8:31 For he rejoiced when he had completed the world, and rejoiced among the children of men. Proverbs 8:32 ¶ Now then, my son, hear me: blessed is the man who shall hearken to me, and the mortal who shall keep my ways; Proverbs 8:33 Proverbs 8:34 watching daily at my doors, waiting at the posts of my entrances.

Proverbs 28:23 ¶ He that reproves a man's ways shall have more favour than he that flatters with the tongue. Proverbs 28:24 ¶ He that casts off father or mother, and thinks he sins not; the same is partaker with an ungodly man. Proverbs 28:25 ¶ An unbelieving man judges rashly: but he that trusts in the Lord will act carefully. Proverbs 28:26 ¶ He that trusts to a bold heart, such an one is a fool: but he that walks in wisdom shall be safe. Proverbs 28:27 ¶ He that gives to the poor shall not be in want: but he that turns away his eye from him shall be in great distress. Proverbs 28:28 ¶ In the places of ungodly men the righteous mourn: but in their destruction the righteous shall be multiplied."
Ecclesiastes,6,1,"A) for who knows what is good for a man in his life, during the number of the life of the days of his vanity? and he has spent them as a shadow; for who shall tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?"
Isaiah,3,21,"A) and the garments with purple grounds, and the shawls to be worn in the house, and the Spartan transparent dresses, Isaiah 3:23"
Isaiah,3,21,"B) and those made of fine linen, and the purple ones, and the scarlet ones, and the fine linen, interwoven with gold and purple, and the light coverings for couches. Isaiah 3:24 And there shall be instead of a sweet smell, dust; and instead of a girdle, thou shalt gird thyself with a rope; and instead of a golden ornament for the head, thou shalt have baldness on account of thy works; and instead of a tunic with a scarlet ground, thou shalt gird thyself with sackcloth. Isaiah 3:25 And thy most beautiful son whom thou lovest shall fall by the sword; and your mighty men shall fall by the sword, and shall be brought low. Isaiah 3:26 And the stores of your ornaments shall mourn, and thou shalt be left alone, and shalt be levelled with the ground."
Isaiah,9,22,"A) and he that is in anguish shall not be distressed only for a time. (9:1) Drink this first. Act quickly, O land of Zabulon, land of Nephthalim, and the rest inhabiting the sea-coast, and the land beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles. Isaiah 9:2 O people walking in darkness, behold a great light: ye that dwell in the region and shadow of death, a light shall shine upon you. Isaiah 9:3 The multitude of the people which thou hast brought down in thy joy, they shall even rejoice before thee as they that rejoice in harvest, and as they that divide the spoil. Isaiah 9:4 Because the yoke that was laid upon them has been taken away, and the rod that was on their neck: for he has broken the rod of the exactors, as in the day of Madiam. Isaiah 9:5 For they shall compensate for every garment that has been acquired by deceit, and all raiment with restitution; and they shall be willing, even if they were burnt with fire. Isaiah 9:6 For a child is born to us, and a son is given to us, whose government is upon his shoulder: and his name is called the Messenger of great counsel: for I will bring peace upon the princes, and health to him. Isaiah 9:7 His government shall be great, and of his peace there is no end: it shall be upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to support it with judgement and with righteousness, from henceforth and forever. The seal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this. Isaiah 9:8 ¶ The Lord has sent death upon Jacob, and it has come upon Israel. Isaiah 9:9 And all the people of Ephraim, and they that dwelt in Samaria shall know, who say in their pride and lofty heart, Isaiah 9:10 The bricks are fallen down, but come, let us hew stones, and cut down sycamores and cedars, and let us build for ourselves a tower. Isaiah 9:11 And God shall dash down them that rise up against him on mount Sion, and shall scatter his enemies; Isaiah 9:12 even Syria from the rising of the sun, and the Greeks from the setting of the sun, who devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but still his hand is exalted. Isaiah 9:13 But the people turned not until they were smitten, and they sought not the Lord. Isaiah 9:14 So the Lord took away from Israel the head and tail, great and small, in one day: Isaiah 9:15 the old man, and them that respect persons, this is the head; and the prophet teaching unlawful things, he is the tail. Isaiah 9:16 And they that pronounce this people blessed shall mislead them; and they mislead them that they may devour them. Isaiah 9:17 Therefore the Lord shall not take pleasure in their young men, neither shall he have pity on their orphans or on their widows: for they are all transgressors and wicked, and every mouth speaks unjustly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is yet exalted. Isaiah 9:18 And iniquity shall burn as fire, and shall be devoured by fire as dry grass: and it shall burn in the thickets of the wood, and shall devour all that is round about the hills. Isaiah 9:19 The whole earth is set on fire because of the fierce anger of the Lord, and the people shall be as men burnt by fire: no man shall pity his brother. Isaiah 9:20 But one shall turn aside to the right hand, for he shall be hungry; and shall eat on the left, and a man shall by no means be satisfied with eating the flesh of his own arm. Isaiah 9:21 For Manasses shall eat the flesh of Ephraim, and Ephraim the flesh of Manasses; for they shall besiege Juda together. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is yet exalted."
Isaiah,35,9,"B) and shall return, and come to Sion with joy, and everlasting joy shall be over their head; for on their head shall be praise and exultation, and joy shall take possession of them: sorrow and pain, and groaning have fled away."
Isaiah,38,14,"A) and removed the sorrow of my soul. Isaiah 38:16 Yea, O Lord, for it was told thee concerning this; and thou hast revived my breath; and I am comforted, and live. Isaiah 38:17 For thou hast chosen my soul, that it should not perish: and thou hast cast all my sins behind me. Isaiah 38:18 For they that are in the grave shall not praise thee, neither shall the dead bless thee, neither shall they that are in Hades hope for thy mercy. Isaiah 38:19 The living shall bless thee, as I also do: for from this day shall I beget children, who shall declare thy righteousness, Isaiah 38:20 O God of my salvation; and I will not cease blessing thee with the psaltery all the days of my life before the house of God. Isaiah 38:21 Now Esaias had said to Ezekias; Take a cake of figs, and mash them, and apply them as a plaster, and thou shalt be well. Isaiah 38:22 And Ezekias said, This is a sign to Ezekias, that I shall go up to the house of God."
Jeremiah,27,14,"A) for I sent them not, saith the Lord; and they prophesy in my name unjustly, that I might destroy you, and ye should perish, and your prophets, who unrighteously prophesy lies to you. Jeremiah 27:16 (34:16) I spoke to you, and to all this people, and to the priests, saying, Thus said the Lord; Hearken not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the Lord's house shall return from Babylon: for they prophesy to you unrighteous words. Jeremiah 27:17 (34:17) I sent them not. Jeremiah 27:18 (34:18) If they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is in them, let them meet me, for thus has the Lord said. Jeremiah 27:19 (34:19) And as for the remaining vessels, Jeremiah 27:20 (34:20) which the king of Babylon took not, when he carried Jechonias prisoner out of Jerusalem, Jeremiah 27:21 Jeremiah 27:22 (34:22) they shall go into Babylon, saith the Lord."
Zephaniah,3,1,"A) Alas the glorious and ransomed city. Zephaniah 3:2 The dove hearkened not to the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the Lord, and she drew not near to her God. Zephaniah 3:3 Her princes within her were as roaring lions, her judges as the wolves of Arabia; they remained not till the morrow. Zephaniah 3:4 Her prophets are light and scornful men: her priests profane the holy things, and sinfully transgress the law. Zephaniah 3:5 But the just Lord is in the midst of her, and he will never do an unjust thing: morning by morning he will bring out his judgment to the light, and it is not hidden, and he knows not injustice by extortion, nor injustice in strife. Zephaniah 3:6 I have brought down the proud with destruction; their corners are destroyed: I will make their ways completely waste, so that none shall go through: their cities are come to an end, by reason of no man living or dwelling in them. Zephaniah 3:7 I said, But do ye fear me, and receive instruction, and ye shall not be cut off from the face of the land for all the vengeance I have brought upon her: prepare thou, rise early: all their produce is spoilt. Zephaniah 3:8 ¶ Therefore wait upon me, saith the Lord, until the day when I rise up for a witness: because my judgment shall be on the gatherings of the nations, to draw to me kings, to pour out upon them all my fierce anger: for the whole earth shall be consumed with the fire of my jealousy. Zephaniah 3:9 For then will I turn to the peoples a tongue for her generation, that all may call on the name of the Lord, to serve him under one yoke. Zephaniah 3:10 From the boundaries of the rivers of Ethiopia will I receive my dispersed ones; they shall offer sacrifices to me. Zephaniah 3:11 In that day thou shalt not be ashamed of all thy practices, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then will I take away from thee thy disdainful pride, and thou shalt no more magnify thyself upon my holy mountain. Zephaniah 3:12 And I will leave in thee a meek and lowly people; Zephaniah 3:13 and the remnant of Israel shall fear the name of the Lord, and shall do no iniquity, neither shall they speak vanity; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed, and lie down, and there shall be none to terrify them. Zephaniah 3:14 ¶ Rejoice, O daughter of Sion; cry aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem; rejoice and delight thyself with all thine heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. Zephaniah 3:15 The Lord has taken away thine iniquities, he has ransomed thee from the hand of thine enemies: the Lord, the King of Israel, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more. Zephaniah 3:16 At that time the Lord shall say to Jerusalem, Be of good courage, Sion; let not thine hands be slack. Zephaniah 3:17 The Lord thy God is in thee; the Mighty One shall save thee: he shall bring joy upon thee, and shall refresh thee with his love; and he shall rejoice over thee with delight as in a day of feasting. Zephaniah 3:18 And I will gather thine afflicted ones. Alas! who has taken up a reproach against her? Zephaniah 3:19 Behold, I will work in thee for thy sake at that time, saith the Lord: and I will save her that was oppressed, and receive her that was rejected; and I will make them a praise, and honoured in all the earth. Zephaniah 3:20 And their enemies shall be ashamed at that time, when I shall deal well with you, and at the time when I shall receive you: for I will make you honoured and a praise among all the nations of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before you, saith the Lord. Haggai 1:1 ¶ In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the firs day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of the prophet Aggaeus, saying, Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec, the high priest, saying, Haggai 1:2 Thus saith the Lord Almighty, saying, This people say, The time is not come to build the house of the Lord. Haggai 1:3 And the word of the Lord came by the hand of the prophet Aggaeus, saying, Haggai 1:4 Is it time for you to dwell in your ceiled houses, whereas our house is desolate? Haggai 1:5 And now thus saith the Lord Almighty; Consider your ways, I pray you. Haggai 1:6 Ye have sown much, but brought in little; ye have eaten, and are not satisfied; ye have drunk, and are not satisfied with drink, ye have clothed yourselves, and have not become warm thereby: and he that earns wages has gathered them into a bag full of holes. Haggai 1:7 Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Consider your ways. Haggai 1:8 Go up to the mountain, and cut timber; build the house, and I will take pleasure in it, and be glorified, saith the Lord. Haggai 1:9 Ye looked for much, and there came little; and it was brought into the house, and I blew it away. Therefore thus saith the Lord Almighty, Because my house is desolate, and ye run everyone into his own house; Haggai 1:10 therefore shall the sky withhold dew, and the earth shall keep back her produce. Haggai 1:11 And I will bring a sword upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and all that the earth produces, and upon the men, and upon the cattle, and upon all the labours of their hands. Haggai 1:12 ¶ And Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and Jesus the son of Josedec, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people, hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of the prophet Aggaeus, according as the Lord their God had sent him to them, and the people feared before the Lord. Haggai 1:13 And Aggaeus the Lord's messenger spoke among the messengers of the Lord to the people, saying, I am with you, saith the Lord. Haggai 1:14 And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus the son of Josedec, the high priest, and the spirit of the remnant of all the people; and they went in, and wrought in the house of the Lord Almighty their God, Haggai 1:15"
Zephaniah,3,14,"A) on the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king."
