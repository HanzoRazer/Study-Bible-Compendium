Genesis,20,18,"For the Lord had closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech on ac- count of Sara, Abraham’s wife."
Genesis,21,1,"And the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised: and fulfilled what he had spoken."
Genesis,21,2,And she conceived

Genesis,21,6,And
Genesis,21,7,"And again she said: Who would believe that Abraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a son, whom she bore to him in his old age."
Genesis,21,8,And the child grew and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaning. Sarah Turns against Hagar (Galatians 4:21–30)
Genesis,21,9,"And when Sara had seen the son of Agar the Egyptian playing with Isaac her son, she said to Abraham:"
Genesis,21,10,"Cast out this bondwoman, and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son"
Genesis,21,11,Abraham took this grievously for his son.
Genesis,21,12,"And God said to him: Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bondwoman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for"
Genesis,21,13,"But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great nation,"
Genesis,21,14,"So Abraham rose up in the morning, and taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee."
Genesis,21,15,"And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there."
Genesis,21,16,"And she went her way, and sat over against him a great way off as far as a bow can carry, for she"
Genesis,21,17,"And God heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, saying: What art thou"
Genesis,21,18,"Arise,"
Genesis,21,19,"And God opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink."

Genesis,21,23,"Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land"
Genesis,21,24,And Abraham said: I will swear.
Genesis,21,25,And he reproved Abimelech
Genesis,21,26,"And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till to day."
Genesis,21,27,And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league.
Genesis,21,28,And Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock.
Genesis,21,29,And Abimelech said to him: What mean

Genesis,22,9,"And they came to the place which God had shown him, where he built an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it: and when he had bound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood."
Genesis,22,10,"And he put forth his hand and took the sword, to sacrifice his son. The LORD Provides the Sacrifice"
Genesis,22,11,"And behold an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abraham. And he"
Genesis,22,12,"And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake."
Genesis,22,13,"Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a ram amongst the briers sticking fast by the"
Genesis,22,14,"And he called the name of that place, The Lord seeth. Whereupon even to this day it is said: In the mountain the Lord will see."

Genesis,23,7,"Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the people of the land, to wit the children of Heth:"
Genesis,23,8,"And said to them: If it please your soul that I should bury my dead, hear me, and intercede for me to Ephron"
Genesis,23,9,"That he may give me the double cave, which he hath in the end of his field: for as"
Genesis,23,10,Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the children of Heth. And Ephron made answer to Abraham in the hearing

Genesis,23,12,"Abraham bowed down before the people of the land,"
Genesis,23,13,"And he spoke to Ephron, in the presence of the people: I beseech thee to hear me: I will give money for the field:"
Genesis,23,14,And Ephron answered:
Genesis,23,15,"My lord, hear me. The ground which thou desirest, is worth four hundred sicles of silver: this is the price between me and thee: but"
Genesis,23,16,"And when Abraham had heard this, he weighed out the money that Ephron had asked, in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred sicles of silver of common current money."
Genesis,23,17,"And the field that before was Ephron’s, wherein was the double cave, looking towards Mambre, both"

Judges,20,32,"For they thought to cut them off, as they did before. But they artfully feigning a flight, designed to draw them away from the city, and by their seeming to flee to bring them to the highways aforesaid."
Judges,20,33,"Then all the children of Israel rising up out of the places where they were, set their army in battle array, in the place which is called Baalthamar. The ambushes also which were about the city, began"

Judges,20,35,"And the Lord defeated them before the children of Israel, and they slew of them in that day five and twenty thousand, and one hundred, all fighting men and that drew the sword."

Judges,21,19,"So they took counsel, and said: Behold there is a yearly solemnity of the Lord in Silo, which is situate on the north of the city of Bethel, and on the east side of the way, that goeth from Bethel to Sichem,"
Judges,21,20,"And they commanded the children of Benjamin, and said:"
Judges,21,21,"And when you shall see the daughters of Silo come out, as the custom is, to dance, come ye on a sudden out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife"

Judges,21,25,In those days there was no king in Israel: but every one did that which seemed right to himself.
Ruth,1,1,"In the days of one of the judges, when the judges ruled, there came a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem Juda, went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons."
Ruth,1,2,"He was named Elimelech, and his wife, Noemi: and his two sons, the one Mahalon, and the other"
Ruth,1,3,And
Ruth,1,4,"And they took wives of the women of Moab, of which one was called Orpha, and the other Ruth. And they dwelt there ten years."
Ruth,1,5,"And they both died, to wit, Mahalon and Chelion: and the woman was left alone, having lost both her sons and her husband. Ruth’s Loyalty to Naomi"
Ruth,1,6,And she arose to go from the land of Moab to her own country with both her daughters in law: for
Ruth,1,7,"Wherefore she went forth out of the place of her sojournment, with both her daughters in law: and being now in the"
Ruth,1,8,She said to them: Go ye home to your mothers: the Lord deal
Ruth,1,9,May he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands which you shall take. And she kissed them. And they lifted up their voice
Ruth,1,10,And to say: We will go on with thee to thy people.
Ruth,1,11,"But she answered them: Return, my daughters: why come ye with me? have I any more sons in my womb, that you may hope"
Ruth,1,12,"Return again, my daughters, and go your ways: for I am now spent with age,"
Ruth,1,13,"If you would wait till they were grown up, and come to man’s estate, you would be old women before you marry. Do not so, my daughters, I beseech you: for I am grieved the more for your distress, and the hand of the Lord is gone out against me."
Ruth,1,14,"And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep again: Orpha kissed her mother in law and returned: Ruth stuck close to her mother in law."
Ruth,1,15,"And Noemi said to her: Behold thy kinswoman is returned to her people, and to her gods, go thou"

Ruth,1,18,"Then Noemi, seeing that Ruth was steadfastly determined to go with her, would not be against it, nor persuade her any more to return to her friends: The Return to Bethlehem"
Ruth,1,19,"So they went together and came to Bethlehem. And when they were come into the city, the report"
Ruth,1,20,"But she said to them: Call me not Noemi, (that is, beautiful,) but call me Mara, (that is, bitter,) for the Almighty hath quite filled"
Ruth,1,21,"I went out full, and the Lord hath brought me back empty. Why then do you call me Noemi, whom the Lord hath humbled and the Almighty hath afflicted?"
Ruth,1,22,"So Noemi came with Ruth the Moabitess her daughter in law, from the land of her sojournment: and returned into Bethlehem, in the beginning of the barley harvest."
Ruth,2,1,"Now her husband Elimelech had a kinsman, a powerful man, and very rich, whose name was Booz."
Ruth,2,2,"And Ruth the Moabitess said to her mother in law: If thou wilt, I will go into the field, and glean the ears of corn that escape the hands of the reapers, wheresoever I shall find grace with a householder"
Ruth,2,3,"She went therefore and gleaned the ears of corn after the reapers. And it happened that the owner of that field was Booz, who"
Ruth,2,4,"And behold, he came out of Bethlehem, and said to the reapers: The"
Ruth,2,5,And Booz said to the young man that

Ruth,2,7,"And she desired leave to glean the ears of corn that remain, following the steps of the reapers: and she hath been in the field from morning till now, and hath not gone home for one moment."
Ruth,2,8,"And Booz said to Ruth: Hear me, daughter, do not go to glean in any other field, and do not depart"
Ruth,2,9,"And follow where they reap. For I have charged my young men, not to molest thee: and if thou art thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of the waters whereof the"
Ruth,2,10,"She fell on her face and worshipping upon the ground, said to him: Whence cometh this to me, that I should find grace before thy eyes, and that thou shouldst vouchsafe to take notice"
Ruth,2,11,"And he answered her: All hath been told me, that thou hast done to thy mother in law after the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left thy parents, and the"
Ruth,2,12,"The Lord render unto thee for thy work, and mayest thou receive a full reward of the Lord the God of Israel, to"
Ruth,2,13,"And she said: I have found grace in thy eyes, my lord, who hast comforted me and hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, who am not like to one of thy maids."
Ruth,2,14,"And Booz said to her: At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. So she sat at the side of the reapers, and she heaped to herself frumenty, and ate and was"
Ruth,2,15,"And she arose from thence, to glean the ears of corn as before. And"
Ruth,2,16,"And let fall some of your handfuls of purpose, and leave them, that she may gather them without shame, and let no man rebuke her when she gathereth them."
Ruth,2,17,She gleaned therefore in the field till evening: and beating out with a rod and threshing what she
Ruth,2,18,"Which she took up and returned into the city, and shewed it to her mother in law: moreover she brought out, and"
Ruth,2,19,"And her mother in law said to her: Where hast thou gleaned to day, and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that hath had pity on thee. And she told her with whom she had wrought: and she told the man’s name, that he was"
Ruth,2,20,"And Noemi answered her: Blessed be he of the Lord: because the same kindness which he shewed to the living, he hath kept also to the dead. And again she said: The man is our kinsman."
Ruth,2,21,"And Ruth said, He also charged me, that I should keep close to his reapers, till all the corn should"
Ruth,2,22,"And her mother in law said to her: It is better for thee, my daughter, to go out to reap"
Ruth,2,23,"So she kept close to the maids of Booz: and continued to glean with them, till all the barley and the wheat were laid up in the barns."
Ruth,3,1,"After she was returned to her mother in law, Noemi said to her: My daughter, I will seek rest for thee,"
Ruth,3,2,"This Booz, with whose maids thou wast joined in the"
Ruth,3,3,"Wash thyself therefore and anoint thee, and put on thy best garments, and go down to the barnfloor: but let"
Ruth,3,4,"And when he shall go to sleep, mark the place wherein he sleepeth: and thou shalt go in, and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered"
Ruth,3,5,"She answered: Whatsoever thou shalt command, I will do."
Ruth,3,6,"And she went down to the barnfloor, and did all that her mother in law had bid her."
Ruth,3,7,"And when Booz had eaten, and drunk, and was merry, he went to sleep by the heap of sheaves, and she came softly and uncovering his feet, laid herself down."
Ruth,3,8,"And behold, when it was now midnight the man was afraid, and troubled: and he saw a woman lying"
Ruth,3,9,And he said to her: Who art thou? And she answered: I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread
Ruth,3,10,"And he said: Blessed art thou of the Lord, my daughter, and thy latter kindness has surpassed the former: because thou hast not followed young"
Ruth,3,11,"Fear not therefore, but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do to thee."
Ruth,3,12,Neither
Ruth,3,13,"Rest thou this night: and when morning is come, if he will take thee by the right of kindred, all is well: but if he will not, I will undoubtedly take thee, as the Lord liveth: sleep till the morning."
Ruth,3,14,So she slept at his feet till the night was going off. And she arose before men could know one
Ruth,3,15,"And again he said: Spread thy mantle, wherewith thou art covered, and hold it with both hands. And when she spread it and held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it upon her. And she carried it and went into"
Ruth,3,16,"And came to her mother in law; who said to her: What hast thou done, daughter? And she"
Ruth,3,17,And she said: Behold he hath given me six measures of
Ruth,3,18,"And Noemi said: Wait my daughter, till we see what end the thing will have. For the man will not rest until he have accomplished what he hath said."
Ruth,4,1,"Then Booz went up to the gate, and sat there. And when he had seen the kinsman going by, of whom he had spoken before, he said to him, calling him by his name: Turn aside for a little while, and sit"
Ruth,4,2,"And Booz taking ten men of the ancients of the city, said"
Ruth,4,3,"They sat down, and he spoke to the kinsman: Noemi, who is returned"
Ruth,4,4,"I would have thee to understand this, and would tell thee before all that sit here, and before the ancients of my people. If thou wilt take possession of it by the right of kindred: buy it and possess it: but if it please thee not, tell me so, that I may know what I have to do. For there is no near kinsman besides"
Ruth,4,5,"And Booz said to him: When thou shalt buy the field at the woman’s hand, thou must take also Ruth the Moabitess, who"
Ruth,4,6,"He answered: I yield up my right of next akin: for I must not cut off the posterity of my own family. Do thou make use of my privilege, which I profess I do willingly forego."
Ruth,4,7,"Now this in former times was the manner in Israel between kinsmen, that if at any time one yielded his right to another: that the grant might be sure, the man put off his shoe, and gave it to his neighhour;"
Ruth,4,8,So Booz said to his kinsman: Put off thy shoe. And
Ruth,4,9,"And he said to the ancients and to all the people: You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and Chelion’s, and Mahalon’s, of the"
Ruth,4,10,"And have taken to wife Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahalon, to raise up the name of the deceased in his inheritance lest his name be cut off, from among his family and his brethren"
Ruth,4,11,"Then all the people that were in the gate, and the ancients answered: We are witnesses: The Lord make this woman who cometh into thy house, like Rachel, and Lia, who built up the house of Israel: that she may be an example of virtue in Ephrata,"
Ruth,4,12,"And that the house may be, as the house of Phares, whom Thamar bore unto Juda, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman. Boaz Marries Ruth"
Ruth,4,13,"Booz therefore took Ruth, and married her: and went in unto her, and the Lord gave her to conceive"
Ruth,4,14,"And the women said to Noemi: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not suffered thy"
Ruth,4,15,"And thou shouldst have one to comfort thy soul, and cherish thy old age. For he is born of thy daughter in law: who loveth thee: and is much better to thee, than if thou hadst seven sons."
Ruth,4,16,"And Noemi taking the child laid it in her bosom, and she carried it, and was a nurse unto it."
Ruth,4,17,"And the women her neighbours, congratulating with her and saying: There is a son born to Noemi: called his name Obed: he is the father of Isai, the father of David. The Line of David (Matthew 1:1–17; Luke 3:23–38)"

1 Samuel,1,11,"And she made a vow, saying: O Lord, of hosts, if thou wilt look down on the affliction of thy servant, and wilt be mindful of me, and not forget thy handmaid, and wilt give to thy servant a man child: I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head."
1 Samuel,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she multiplied prayers before the Lord, that Heli observed her mouth."
1 Samuel,1,13,"Now Anna spoke in her heart, and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard at all. Heli therefore"
1 Samuel,1,14,"And said to her: How long wilt thou, be drunk? digest a little the wine, of"

1 Samuel,2,11,"And Elcana went to Ramatha, to his house: but the child ministered in the sight of the Lord before the face of Heli the priest. Eli’s Wicked Sons"
1 Samuel,2,12,"Now the sons of Heli were children of Belial, not knowing the Lord,"
1 Samuel,2,13,"Nor the office of the priests to the people: but whosoever had offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest came, while the flesh was"
1 Samuel,2,14,"And thrust it into the kettle, or into the caldron, or into the pot, or into the pan: and all that the fleshhook brought up, the priest took to himself. Thus"
1 Samuel,2,15,"Also before they burnt the fat, the servant of the priest came, and said to the man that sacrificed: Give me flesh to boil for the priest: for I will not take of thee"
1 Samuel,2,16,"And he that sacrificed said to him: Let the fat first be burnt to day according to the custom, and then take as much as thy soul desireth. But he answered and said to him: Not so:"
1 Samuel,2,17,Wherefore the sin of the young men was exceeding great before the Lord: because they withdrew men from the sacrifice of the Lord.
1 Samuel,2,18,But Samuel ministered before the face of the Lord: being a child girded with a linen ephod.
1 Samuel,2,19,"And his mother made him a little coat, which she brought to him on the appointed days, when she went up"
1 Samuel,2,20,"And Heli blessed Elcana and his wife: and he said to him: The Lord give thee seed of this woman, for the loan thou hast lent to the Lord. And they went to their own home."
1 Samuel,2,21,"And the Lord visited Anna, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters: and the child Samuel became great before the Lord."
1 Samuel,2,22,"Now Heli was very old, and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel: and how they lay with the"

1 Samuel,2,26,"But the child Samuel advanced, and grew on, and pleased both the Lord and men. A Prophecy against the House of Eli"
1 Samuel,2,27,"And there came a man of God to Heli, and said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Did I not plainly appear"
1 Samuel,2,28,"And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my sitar, and burn incense to me, and to wear the"
1 Samuel,2,29,"Why have you kicked away my victims, and my gifts which I commanded to be offered in the temple: and thou hast rather honoured thy sons than me, to eat the firstfruits of every sacrifice of my people Israel?"
1 Samuel,2,30,"Wherefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father should minister in my sight, for ever. But now saith the Lord: Far be this from me: but whosoever"

1 Samuel,2,33,However I will not altogether take away a man of thee from my altar: but that thy eyes may faint and thy soul be spent: and a great part of thy house shall die

1 Samuel,2,35,"And I will raise me up a faithful priest, who shall do according to my heart, and my soul, and I will build him a faithful house, and he shall"
1 Samuel,2,36,"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall remain in thy house, shall come that he may be prayed for, and shall offer a piece of silver, and a roll of bread, and shall say: Put me, I beseech thee, to somewhat of the priestly office, that I may eat a morsel of bread."
1 Samuel,3,1,"Now the child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Heli, and the word of the Lord was precious in those days, there was no manifest vision."
1 Samuel,3,2,"And it came to pass one day when Heli lay in his place, and his eyes were grown dim, that he could"

1 Samuel,3,5,And he ran to Heli and said: Here am I: for thou didst call me. He said: I did not call: go back and sleep. And he went and slept.
1 Samuel,3,6,"And the Lord called Samuel again. And Samuel arose and went to Heli, and said: Here am I: for thou"
1 Samuel,3,7,Now Samuel did not yet know
1 Samuel,3,8,And the Lord called Samuel again
1 Samuel,3,9,"And said: Here am I: for thou didst call me. Then Heli understood that the Lord called the child, and he said to Samuel: Go, and sleep: and if he shall call thee any more, thou shalt say: Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and slept in his place."
1 Samuel,3,10,"And the Lord came and stood: and he called, as he had called the other times: Samuel, Samuel. And"

1 Samuel,4,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight: and Israel went out to war against the Philistines, and camped by the Stone of help. And the Philistines"
1 Samuel,4,2,"And put their army in array against Israel. And when they had joined battle, Israel turned their backs to the Philistines, and there was slain in that fight here and there in the fields about"
1 Samuel,4,3,"And the people returned to the camp: and the ancients of Israel said: Why hath the Lord defeated us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch unto us the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Silo, and let it come in the midst of us, that it may save us from the hand of our enemies."
1 Samuel,4,4,"So the people sent to Silo, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts sitting upon the cherubims: and the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were with the ark of the covenant of God."
1 Samuel,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord was come into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great"

1 Samuel,4,8,Woe to us: for there was no such great joy yesterday and the day before: Woe to us. Who shall deliver us from the hand of these high gods? these are the gods that struck Egypt

1 Samuel,4,10,"So the Philistines fought, and Israel was overthrown, and every man fled to his own dwelling: and"
1 Samuel,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken: and the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were slain. The Death of Eli"
1 Samuel,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Silo the same day, with his clothes"
1 Samuel,4,13,"And when he was come, Heli sat upon a stool over against the way watching. For his heart was fearful for the ark of God. And when the man was come into the city,"
1 Samuel,4,14,"And Heli heard the noise of the cry, and he said: What meaneth"
1 Samuel,4,15,Now Heli was ninety and eight
1 Samuel,4,16,"And he said to Heli: I am he that came from the battle, and have fled out of the field this day. And he said to him: What is there done, my son?"
1 Samuel,4,17,"And he that brought the news answered, and said: Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter of the people: moreover thy two sons, Ophni and Phinees, are dead: and"
1 Samuel,4,18,"And when he had named the ark of God, he fell from his stool backwards by the door, and broke his neck, and died. For he was an old man, and far advanced in years: and he judged Israel forty years."
1 Samuel,4,19,"And his daughter in law the wife of Phinees, was big with child, and near her time: and hearing the news that the ark of God was taken, and her father in law, and her husband, were dead, she bowed"
1 Samuel,4,20,"And when she was upon the point of death, they that stood about her said to her: Fear not, for thou hast borne a son. She answered"
1 Samuel,4,21,"And she called the child Ichabod, saying: The glory is gone from"
1 Samuel,4,22,"And she said: The glory is departed from Israel, because the ark of God was taken."
1 Samuel,5,1,"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and carried it from the Stone of help into Azotus."

1 Samuel,5,5,"And only the stump of Dagon remained in its place. For this cause neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that go into the temple tread on the threshold of Dagon in Azotus unto this day."
1 Samuel,5,6,"And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Azotians, and he destroyed them, and afflicted Azotus and the coasts thereof with emerods. And in the villages and fields in the midst of that country, there"
1 Samuel,5,7,"And the men of Azotus seeing this kind of plague, said: The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us: for"
1 Samuel,5,8,"And sending, they gathered together all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said: What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And the Gethrites answered: Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about. And they carried the ark of the"
1 Samuel,5,9,"And while they were carrying it about, the band of the Lord came upon every city with an exceeding great slaughter: and he smote the men of every city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts. And the Gethrites consulted together, and made themselves"
1 Samuel,5,10,"Therefore they sent the ark of God into Accaron. And when the ark of God was come into Accaron, the Accaronites cried out, saying: They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us,"
1 Samuel,5,11,"They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines: and they said: Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return into its own place, and not kill"
1 Samuel,5,12,"For there was the fear of death in every city, and the hand of God was exceeding heavy. The men also that did not die, were afflicted with the emerods: and the cry of every city went up to heaven."
1 Samuel,6,1,Now the ark of God was in the land of the Philistines seven months.
1 Samuel,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying: What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? tell us how we are to send"

1 Samuel,6,10,"They did therefore in this manner: and taking two kine, that had suckling calves, they yoked them"
1 Samuel,6,11,"And they laid the ark of God upon the cart, and the"

1 Samuel,6,13,"Now the Bethsamites were reaping wheat in the valley: and lifting up their eyes they saw the ark,"
1 Samuel,6,14,"And the cart came into the field of Josue a Bethsamite, and stood there. And there was a great stone, and they cut in pieces the wood of the cart, and laid the kine upon it a"

1 Samuel,6,19,"But he slew of the men of Bethsames, because they had seen the ark of the Lord: and he slew of the people seventy men, and fifty thousand of the common people. And the people lamented, because"

1 Samuel,7,2,"And it came to pass, that from the day the ark of the Lord abode in Cariathiarim days were multiplied, (for it was now the twentieth year,) and all the house of Israel rested following the Lord."
1 Samuel,7,3,"And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying: If you turn to the Lord with all your heart, put away the strange gods from among you, Baalim and Astaroth: and prepare your hearts unto the Lord,"
1 Samuel,7,4,"Then the children of Israel put away Baalim and Astaroth, and served the Lord only."
1 Samuel,7,5,"And Samuel said: Gather all Israel to Masphath, that I may pray to the Lord for you."
1 Samuel,7,6,"And they gathered together to Masphath: and they drew water, and poured it out before the Lord, and they fasted on that day, and they said there: We have sinned against the Lord. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Masphath."

1 Samuel,7,14,"And the cities, which the Philistines had taken from Israel, were restored to Israel, from Accaron to Geth, and their borders: and he delivered Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and there was peace between Israel and the Amorrhites."
1 Samuel,7,15,And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life:
1 Samuel,7,16,And he went every year about to Bethel and to

1 Samuel,8,1,"And it came to pass when Samuel was old, that he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel."
1 Samuel,8,2,"Now the name of his firstborn son was Joel: and the name of the second was Abia, judges in Bersabee."
1 Samuel,8,3,"And his sons walked not in his ways: but they turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment."
1 Samuel,8,4,"Then all the ancients of Israel being assembled, came to Samuel to Ramatha."
1 Samuel,8,5,"And they said to him: Behold thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: make us a king, to judge us, as all nations"

1 Samuel,9,20,"And as for the asses, which were lost three days ago, be not solicitous, because they are found. And for whom shall be all the best things of Israel? Shall they not be for thee and for all thy father’s house?"
1 Samuel,9,21,"And Saul answering, said: Am not I a son of Jemini of the least tribe of Israel, and my kindred the last among all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then hast thou spoken this word to me?"
1 Samuel,9,22,"Then Samuel taking Saul and his servant, brought them into the parlour, and gave them a place at"
1 Samuel,9,23,And Samuel said to the cook:
1 Samuel,9,24,"And the cook took up the shoulder, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said: Behold what is left, set it before thee, and eat: because it was kept of purpose for thee, when I invited the people. And Saul ate with Samuel that day."

1 Samuel,10,1,"And Samuel took a little vial of oil and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said: Behold, the Lord hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance, and thou shalt deliver his people out of the hands of their enemies, that are round about them.

1 Samuel,10,20,"And Samuel brought to him all the tribes of Israel, and the lot fell on the tribe of Benjamin."
1 Samuel,10,21,"And he brought the tribe of Benjamin and the kindreds thereof, and the lot fell Upon the kindred of Metri,"

1 Samuel,17,25,"And some one of Israel said: Have you seen this man that is come up, for he is come up to defy Israel. And the man that shall slay him, the king will enrich with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and will make his father’s house free from tribute in Israel."
1 Samuel,17,26,"And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying: What shall be given to the man that shall kill this Philistine, and shall take away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine,"
1 Samuel,17,27,And the people answered him the same words saying: These things shall be given to the man that shall slay him.

1 Samuel,18,6,"Now when David returned, after be slew the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels of joy, and cornets."
1 Samuel,18,7,"And the women sung as they played, and they said: Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands."

1 Samuel,18,28,"And Saul saw, and understood that the Lord was with David. And Michol the daughter of Saul loved him."
1 Samuel,18,29,And Saul began to fear David more: and Saul became David’s enemy continually.
1 Samuel,18,30,"And the princes of the Philistines went forth: and from the beginning of their going forth, David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul, and his name became very famous."
1 Samuel,19,1,"And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan"
1 Samuel,19,2,"And Jonathan told David, saying: Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: wherefore look to thyself, I beseech thee, in the morning, and thou shalt abide in a secret"
1 Samuel,19,3,And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art: and
1 Samuel,19,4,"And Jonathan spoke good things of David to Saul his father: and said to him: Sin not, O king, against thy servant, David, because"
1 Samuel,19,5,"And he put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the Lord wrought great salvation for all Israel. Thou sawest it and didst rejoice. Why therefore wilt thou sin against innocent blood by killing David, who is without fault?"
1 Samuel,19,6,"And when Saul heard this he was appeased with the words of Jonathan, and swore: As the Lord liveth"
1 Samuel,19,7,"Then Jonathan called David and told him all these words: and Jonathan brought in David to Saul, and he was before him, as he had been yesterday and the day before."
1 Samuel,19,8,"And the war began again, and David went out and fought against the Philistines, and defeated them"
1 Samuel,19,9,"And the evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul,"
1 Samuel,19,10,"And Saul endeavoured to nail David to the wall with his spear. And David slipt away out of the presence of Saul: and the spear missed him, and was fastened in the wall, and David fled and escaped that night."
1 Samuel,19,11,"Saul therefore sent his guards to David’s house to watch him, that he might be killed in the morning. And when Michol David’s wife had told him this, saying: Unless thou save thyself this night, to morrow"
1 Samuel,19,12,She let him down through a window. And he went and fled away and escaped.
1 Samuel,19,13,"And Michol took an image and laid it on the bed, and put a goat’s skin with the hair at the head of it, and"
1 Samuel,19,14,And Saul sent officers to seize David: and it was answered that he was sick.
1 Samuel,19,15,"And again Saul sent to see David, saying: Bring him to me in the bed, that he may be slain."
1 Samuel,19,16,"And when the messengers were come in, they found an image upon the bed, and a goat’s skin at its head."
1 Samuel,19,17,"And Saul said to Michol: Why hast thou deceived me so, and let my enemy go and flee away? And Michol answered Saul: Because he said to me: Let me go, or else I will kill thee."
1 Samuel,19,18,"But David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel in Ramatha, and told him all that Saul had done to"
1 Samuel,19,19,"And it was told Saul by some, saying: Behold"
1 Samuel,19,20,"So Saul sent officers to take David: and when they saw a company of prophets prophesying, and Samuel presiding over them, the spirit of the Lord came also upon them,"
1 Samuel,19,21,"And when this was told Saul, he sent other messengers: but they also prophesied. And again Saul sent messengers the third time: and they prophesied also. And"
1 Samuel,19,22,"Went also himself to Ramatha, and came as far as the great cistern, which is in Socho, and he asked, and said: In what place are Samuel and David? And it was told him:"
1 Samuel,19,23,"And he went to Najoth in Ramatha, and the spirit of the Lord"
1 Samuel,19,24,"And he stripped himself also of his garments, and prophesied with the rest before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and night. This gave occasion to a proverb: What! is Saul too among the prophets?"
1 Samuel,20,1,"But David fled from Najoth, which is in Ramatha, and came and said to Jonathan: What have I done?"
1 Samuel,20,2,"And he said to him: God forbid, thou shalt not die: for my father will do nothing great or little, without first telling me:"
1 Samuel,20,3,"And he swore again to David. And David said: Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, and he will say: Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved. But truly as the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, there is but"

1 Samuel,20,8,"Deal mercifully then with thy servant: for thou hast brought me thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee. But if there be any iniquity in me, do thou kill me, and"
1 Samuel,20,9,"And Jonathan said: Far be this from thee: for if I should certainly know that evil is determined by my father against thee, I could do no otherwise than tell thee. Jonathan and David Renew Their Covenant"
1 Samuel,20,10,"And David answered Jonathan: Who shall bring me word, if thy father should answer thee harshly concerning me?"
1 Samuel,20,11,"And Jonathan said to David: Come and let us go out into the field. And when they were both of them gone out into the field,"
1 Samuel,20,12,"Jonathan said to David: O Lord God of Israel, if I shall discover my father’s mind, to morrow or the day after, and there be any thing good for David, and I send not immediately to thee, and make it"
1 Samuel,20,13,"May the Lord do so and so to Jonathan and add still more. But if my father shall continue in malice against thee, I will discover it to thy ear, and will send thee away, that thou mayest"
1 Samuel,20,14,"And if I live, thou shalt shew"
1 Samuel,20,15,"Thou shalt not take away thy kindness from my house for ever, when the Lord shall have rooted out the enemies of David, every one of them from the earth, may he take away Jonathan from his house, and may the Lord require it at the hands of David’s"
1 Samuel,20,16,Jonathan therefore made a covenant with the house of David: and the Lord required it at

1 Samuel,20,18,"And Jonathan said to him: To morrow is the new moon, and thou wilt be missed:"
1 Samuel,20,19,"For thy seat will be empty till after to morrow. So thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place, where thou must be hid on the day when it is lawful to work, and thou shalt remain beside the stone, which is called"
1 Samuel,20,20,"And I will shoot three arrows near it, and will shoot as if I were exercising myself at a mark."
1 Samuel,20,21,"And I will send a boy, saying to him: Go and fetch me the arrows."
1 Samuel,20,22,"If I shall say to the boy: Behold the arrows are on this side of thee, take them up: come thou to me, because, there is peace to thee, and there is no evil, as the Lord liveth. But if I shall speak thus to the boy: Behold the arrows are"
1 Samuel,20,23,"And concerning the word which I and thou have spoken, the Lord be between thee and me for ever."
1 Samuel,20,24,"So David was hid in the field, and the new moon came, and the king sat down to eat bread."
1 Samuel,20,25,"And when the king sat down upon his chair (according to custom) which was beside the wall, Jonathan"
1 Samuel,20,26,And Saul said nothing that

1 Samuel,20,32,And
1 Samuel,20,33,And Saul caught up
1 Samuel,20,34,"So Jonathan rose from the table in great anger, and did not eat bread on the second day after the new moon. For he was grieved for David, because his father had put him to confusion."
1 Samuel,20,35,"And when the morning came, Jonathan went into the field, according to the appointment with David,"
1 Samuel,20,36,"And he said to his boy: Go, and fetch me the arrows which I shoot. And"
1 Samuel,20,37,"The boy therefore came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot: and Jonathan cried after the boy, and said: Behold the arrow is"

1 Samuel,20,42,"And Jonathan said to David: Go in peace: and let all stand that we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying: The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And David arose, and departed: and Jonathan went into the city."
1 Samuel,21,1,And David came to Nobe to Achimelech the priest: and Achimelech was astonished at David’s coming.
1 Samuel,21,2,"And David said to Achimelech the priest: The king hath commanded me a business, and said: Let no man know the thing for which thou art sent by me, and what manner of commands I have given thee: and I have appointed my servants"
1 Samuel,21,3,"Now therefore if thou have any thing at hand, though it were but five loaves,"
1 Samuel,21,4,"And the priest answered David, saying: I have no common"
1 Samuel,21,5,"And David answered the priest, and said to him: Truly, as to what concerneth women, we have refrained ourselves from yesterday and the day before, when we came out, and the vessels of the young men were holy."
1 Samuel,21,6,"The priest therefore gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there, but only the loaves of proposition, which had been taken away from before the face of the Lord, that hot loaves might be set up."
1 Samuel,21,7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, within the tabernacle of the Lord: and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of Saul’s herdsmen. David Flees to Gath (Psalm 34:1–22; Psalm 56:1–13)"
1 Samuel,21,8,"And David said to Achimelech: Hast thou here at hand a spear, or a sword? for I brought not my own"
1 Samuel,21,9,"And the priest said: Lo, here is the sword of Goliath the Philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of Terebinth, wrapped up in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take this, take it, for here is no other but this. And David said: There is none like that, give it me."
1 Samuel,21,10,And David arose and fled that day from the face of Saul: and came to Achis the king of Geth:
1 Samuel,21,11,"And the servants of Achis, when they saw David, said to him: Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to him in their dances, saying: Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?"
1 Samuel,21,12,"But David laid up these words in his heart, and was exceedingly afraid at the face of Achis the king"
1 Samuel,21,13,"And he changed his countenance before them, and slipt down between their hands: and he"
1 Samuel,21,14,And Achis said to
1 Samuel,21,15,"Have we need of madmen, that you have brought in this fellow, to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?"
1 Samuel,22,1,"David therefore went from thence and fled to the cave of Odollam. And when his brethren, and all his"
1 Samuel,22,2,"And all that were in distress and oppressed with debt, and under affliction of mind gathered themselves unto him: and he became their prince, and there were with him about four hundred men."

1 Samuel,22,14,"And Achimelech answering the king, said: And who amongst all thy servants is so faithful as David,"
1 Samuel,22,15,"Did I begin to day to consult the Lord for him? far be this from me: let not the king suspect such a thing against his servant, or any one in all my father’s house: for thy servant knew nothing of this matter,"

2 Samuel,17,21,"And when they were gone, they came up out of the well, and going on told king David, and said: Arise, and pass quickly over the river: for this manner of counsel has Achitophel given against you."

2 Samuel,18,23,He answered: But what if I run? And he said to him: Run. Then Achimaas running by a nearer way passed Chusai.

2 Samuel,18,27,And the watchman said: The running of the foremost seemeth to me like the running of Achimaas the son of Sadoc. And the king said: He is a good man: and cometh with good news.

1 Kings,2,24,"And now as the Lord liveth, who hath established me, and placed me upon the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised,"
1 Kings,2,25,"And king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaias the son of Joiada, who slew him, and he died."
1 Kings,2,26,"And the king said also to Abiathar the priest: Go to Anathoth to thy lands, for indeed thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst carry the ark of the Lord God"
1 Kings,2,27,"So Solomon cast out Abiathar, from being the priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Deli in Silo. The Execution of Joab"
1 Kings,2,28,"And the news came to Joab, because Joab had turned after Adonias, and had not turned after"

1 Kings,2,38,"And Semei said to the king: The saying is good : as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem, many days."
1 Kings,2,39,"And it came to pass after three years, that the servants of Semei ran away to Achis the son of Maacha"
1 Kings,2,40,"And Semei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Achis to Geth to seek his servants, and he brought them out of Geth."
1 Kings,2,41,"And it was told Solomon that Semei had gone from Jerusalem to Geth, and was come back."

1 Kings,3,1,"And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon, and he made affinity with Pharao the king of Egypt: for he took his daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end"
1 Kings,3,2,But yet the people sacrificed in the high places: far there was no temple built to the name of the Lord until that day.
1 Kings,3,3,"And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the precepts of David his father, only he sacrificed in the high"

1 Kings,3,22,"And the other woman answered: It is not so as thou sayest, but thy child is dead, and mine is alive. On the contrary she said: Thou liest: for my child liveth, and thy child is dead. And in this manner they strove before the king."
1 Kings,3,23,"Then said the king: The one saith, My child is alive, and thy child is dead. And the other answereth:"

1 Kings,4,21,"And Solomon had under him all the kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines,. even to the border of Egypt: and they brought him presents, and served him, all the days of his life."
1 Kings,4,22,"And the provision of Solomon for each day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures"
1 Kings,4,23,"Ten fat oxen and twenty out of the pastures, and a hundred rams, besides venison of harts,"

1 Kings,6,6,"The floor that was underneath, was five cubits in breadth, and the middle floor was six cubits in breadth, and the third door was seven cubits in breadth. And he put beams in the house round about on the outside, that they might not be fastened in the walls of the temple."
1 Kings,6,7,"And the house, when it was in building, was built of stones hewed and made ready: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house when it was in building."
1 Kings,6,8,The door for the middle side was on the right hand of the house : and by winding stairs they went up

1 Kings,6,14,So Solomon built the house and finished it.

1 Kings,6,29,"And all the walls of the temple round about he carved with divers figures and carvings: and he made in them cherubims and palm trees, and divers representations, as it were standing out, and coming"
1 Kings,6,30,And the floor of the house he also overlaid with gold within and without. The Doors

1 Kings,7,1,"And Solomon built his own house in thirteen years, and brought it to perfection."
1 Kings,7,2,"He built also the house of the forest of Libanus, the length of it was a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits, and the height thirty cubits: and four galleries between pillars of cedar: for he had cut cedar trees into"

1 Kings,7,7,"He made also the porch of the throne, wherein is the seat of judgment: and covered it with cedar wood from the floor to the top."
1 Kings,7,8,"And in the midst of the porch, was a small house where he sat in judgment, of the like work. He made also a house for the daughter of Pharao (whom Solomon had taken to wife) of the same work, as this porch,"
1 Kings,7,9,"All of costly stones, which were sawed by a certain rule and measure both within and without: from the foundation to the top of the walls, and without unto the great court."

Nehemiah,9,25,"And they took strong cities and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods: cisterns made by others, vine- yards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: and they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and abounded with de- light in thy great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"But they provoked thee to wrath, and departed from thee, and threw thy law behind their backs: and they killed thy prophets, who admonished them earnestly to return to thee : and they were guilty of great blasphemies."
Nehemiah,9,27,"And thou gavest them into the hands of their enemies, and they afflicted them. And in the time of their tribulation they cried to thee, and thou heardest from heaven, and according to the multitude of thy tender mercies thou gavest them saviours, to save them from the hands of their enemies."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But after they had rest, they returned to do evil in thy sight : and thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, and they had dominion over them. Then they returned, and cried to thee: and thou heardest from heaven, and deliveredst them many times in thy mercies."
Nehemiah,9,29,"And thou didst admonish them to re turn to thy law. But they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them: and they withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."
Nehemiah,9,30,"And thou didst forbear with them for many years, and didst testify against them by thy spirit by the hand of thy prophets: and they heard not, and thou didst deliver them into the hand of the people of the lands."

Nehemiah,9,32,"Now therefore our God, great, strong and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy, turn not away from thy face all the labour which hath come upon us, upon our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our prophets, and our fathers, and all the people from the days of the king of Assur, until this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"And thou art just in all things that have come upon us: because thou hast done truth, but we have done wickedly."
Nehemiah,9,34,"Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept thy law, and have not minded thy commandments, and thy testimonies which thou hast testified among them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"And they have not served thee in their kingdoms, and in thy manifold goodness, which thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land, which thou deliveredst before them, nor did they return from their most wicked devices."
Nehemiah,9,36,"Behold we ourselves this day are bondmen: and the land, which thou gavest our fathers, to eat the bread thereof, and the good things thereof, and we ourselves are servants in it."
Nehemiah,9,37,"And the fruits thereof grow up for the kings, whom thou hast set over us for our sins, and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our beasts, according to their will, and we are in great tribulation. 38and because of all this we ourselves make a covenant, and write it, and our princes, our Levites, and our priests sign it."

Esther,5,2,"And when he saw Esther the queen standing, she pleased his eyes, and he held out toward her the golden sceptre, which he held in his hand: and she drew near, and kissed the top of"
Esther,5,3,"And the king said to her: What wilt then, queen Esther? what is thy request? if thou"
Esther,5,4,"But she answered: If it please the king. I beseech thee to come to me this day, and Aman with thee to the banquet which I have prepared."
Esther,5,5,"And the king said forthwith: Call ye Aman quickly, that he may obey Esther’s will. So the king and"
Esther,5,6,"And the king said to her, after he had drunk wine plentifully: What dost thou desire should be given thee? and for what thing askest"
Esther,5,7,And Esther answered:
Esther,5,8,"If I have found favour in the king’s sight, and if it please the king to give me what I ask, and to fulfil my petition: let the king and Aman come to the banquet which I have prepared them, and to morrow I will open my mind to the king. Haman’s Plot against Mordecai"
Esther,5,9,"So Aman went out that day joyful and merry. And when he saw Mardochai sitting before the gate of the palace, and that he not only did not rise up to honour him, but did not so much as move from the"

Esther,5,14,"Then Zares his wife, and the rest of his friends answered him: Order a great beam to be prepared, fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king, that Mardochai may be hanged upon it, and so thou shalt go full of joy with the king to the banquet. The counsel pleased him, and he commanded a high gibbet to be prepared."
Esther,6,1,"That night the king passed without sleep, and he commanded the histories and chronicles of former"
Esther,6,2,"They came to that place where it was written, how Mardochai had discovered the treason of Bagathan and Thares the eunuchs,"
Esther,6,3,"And when the king heard this, he said: What honour and reward hath Mardochai received for this fidelity? His servants and ministers said to him: He hath received no"
Esther,6,4,"And the king said immediately: Who is in the court? for Aman was coming in to the inner court of the king’s house, to speak to the king, that he might order Mardochai to be hanged upon"
Esther,6,5,"The servants answered: Aman standeth in the court, and the"
Esther,6,6,"And when he was come in, he said to him: What ought to be done to the man whom the king is desirous to honour? But Aman thinking in his heart, and supposing that the king"
Esther,6,7,"Answered: The man whom the king desireth to honour,"
Esther,6,8,"Ought to be clothed with the king’s apparel, and to be set upon the horse that the king rideth upon, and to"
Esther,6,9,"And let the first of the king’s princes and nobles hold his horse, and going through the street of the city, proclaim before him and say: Thus shall he be honoured, whom the king hath a mind to honour."
Esther,6,10,"And the king said to him: Make haste and take the robe and the horse, and do as thou hast spoken to Mardochai the Jew, who sitteth before the gates of the palace. Beware thou pass over any of those"
Esther,6,11,"So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arraying Mardochai in the street of the city, and setting him on the horse, went before him, and proclaimed: This honour is he worthy of, whom the king hath a mind to honour."
Esther,6,12,"But Mardochai returned to the palace gate: and Aman made haste to go to his house, mourning and"
Esther,6,13,"And he told Zares his wife, and his friends, all that had befallen him. And the wise men whom he had in counsel, and his wife answered him: If Mardochai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou canst not resist him, but thou shalt fall in his sight."
Esther,6,14,"As they were yet speaking, the king’s eunuchs came, and compelled him to go quickly to the banquet which the queen had prepared."
Esther,7,1,"So the king and Aman went in, to drink with the queen."
Esther,7,2,"And the king said to her again the second day, after he was warm with wine: What is thy petition, Esther, that it may be granted thee? and what"
Esther,7,3,"Then she answered: If I have found Favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please thee, give me my life for which I ask, and"
Esther,7,4,"For we are given up, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. And would God we were sold for bondmen and bondwomen: the evil might be borne with, and I would have mourned in silence: but now we have an enemy, whose cruelty redoundeth"
Esther,7,5,"And king Assuerus answered and said: Who is this, and of what power, that he should"
Esther,7,6,"And Esther said: It is this Aman that is our adversary and most wicked enemy. Aman hearing this was forthwith astonished, not being able to bear the countenance of the king and of the queen. The Hanging of Haman"
Esther,7,7,"But the king being angry rose up, and went from the place of the banquet into the garden set with trees. Aman also rose up to entreat Esther the queen for his life, for he understood that evil was"
Esther,7,8,"And when the king came back out of the garden set with trees, and entered into the place of the banquet, he found Aman was fallen upon the bed on which Esther lay, and he said: He will force the queen also in my presence, in my own house. The word was not yet"
Esther,7,9,"And Harbona, one of the eunuchs that stood waiting on the king, said: Behold the gibbet which he hath prepared for Mardochai, who spoke for the king, standeth in Aman’s house, being fifty cubits high. And the king said to him:"
Esther,7,10,"So Aman was hanged on the gibbet, which he had prepared for Mardochai: and the king’s wrath ceased."
Esther,8,1,"On that day king Assuerus gave the house of Aman, the Jews’ enemy, to queen Esther, and Mardochai"
Esther,8,2,"And the king took the ring which he had commanded to be taken again from Aman, and gave it to Mardochai. And Esther set Mardochai over her house."
Esther,8,3,"And not content with these things, she fell down at the king’s feet and wept, and speaking to him besought him, that he would give orders that the malice of Aman the Agagite, and his most wicked"
Esther,8,4,"But he, as the manner was, held out the golden sceptre with his hand, which was the sign of clemency: and she arose up and stood"
Esther,8,5,"And said: If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and my request be not disagreeable to him, I beseech thee, that the former letters of Aman the traitor and enemy of the Jews, by which he commanded that they should be destroyed in all the king’s provinces, may be"
Esther,8,6,For how call I endure the murdering and slaughter of my people? The Decree of Xerxes
Esther,8,7,"And king Assuerus answered Esther the queen, and Mardochai the Jew: I have given Aman’s house to Esther, and I have commanded him to be hanged on a gibbet, because he durst lay hands on the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"Write ye therefore to the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king’s name, and seal the letters with my ring. For this was the custom, that no man durst gainsay the letters which were sent in the king’s name, and were sealed with his ring."
Esther,8,9,"Then the king’s scribes and secretaries were called for (now it was the time of the third month which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day of the month, and letters were written, as Mardochai had a mind, to the Jews, and to the governors, and to the deputies, and to the judges, who were rulers over the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia: to province and province, to people and people, according to their languages and characters, and to the Jews, according as they"
Esther,8,10,"And these letters which were sent in the king’s name, were sealed with his ring, and sent by posts: who were to run through all the provinces, to prevent the former letters with new"
Esther,8,11,"And the king gave orders to them, to speak to the Jews in every city, and to command them to gather themselves together, and to stand for their lives, and to kill and destroy all their enemies"
Esther,8,12,And one day of revenge
Esther,8,13,"And this was the content of the letter, that it should be notified in all lands and peoples that were subject to"
Esther,8,14,"So the swift posts went out carrying the messages, and the king’s edict was hung up in Susan."
Esther,8,15,"And Mardochai going forth out of the palace, and from the king’s presence, shone in royal apparel, to wit, of violet and sky colour, wearing a golden crown on his head, and clothed with a cloak of silk"
Esther,8,16,"But to the Jews a new light seemed to rise, joy,"
Esther,8,17,"And in all peoples, cities, and provinces, whithersoever the king’s commandments came, there was wonderful rejoicing, feasts and banquets, and keeping holy day: insomuch that many of other nations and religion, joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies. For a great dread of the name of the Jews had fallen upon all."
Esther,9,1,"So on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which as we have said above is called Adar, when all the Jews were designed to be massacred, and their enemies were greedy after their blood, the case being altered, the Jews began to have the upper hand, and to revenge themselves of their adversaries."
Esther,9,2,"And they gathered themselves together in every city, and town, and place, to lay their hands on their enemies, and their persecutors. And no one durst withstand them, for the fear of their power had gone"
Esther,9,3,"And the judges of the provinces, and the governors, and lieutenants, and every"
Esther,9,4,"For they knew him to be prince of the palace, and to have great power: and the fame of his name increased"
Esther,9,5,So the Jews made a great slaughter of their

Esther,9,7,"Pharsandatha, and Delphon, and Esphatha,"
Esther,9,8,"And Phoratha, and"
Esther,9,9,"And Phermesta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Jezatha."
Esther,9,10,"And when they had slain them, they would not touch the spoils of their goods. Haman’s Sons Hanged"
Esther,9,11,And presently the number of them that were killed in Susan was brought to the king.
Esther,9,12,"And he said to the queen: The Jews have killed five hundred men in the city of Susan, besides the ten sons of Aman: how many dost thou think they have slain in all the provinces? What askest thou"
Esther,9,13,"And she answered: If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews, to do to morrow in Susan as they have done to day, and that the ten"
Esther,9,14,And the king commanded that it should be so done. And
Esther,9,1515,"And on the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews gathered themselves together, and they killed in Susan three hundred men: but they took not their substance."
Esther,9,16,"Moreover through all the provinces which were subject to the king’s dominion the Jews stood for their lives, and slew their enemies and persecutors: insomuch that the number of them that were Billed"
Esther,9,17,"Now the thirteenth day of the month Adar was the first day with them all of the slaughter, and on the fourteenth day they left off. Which they ordained to be kept holy day, so that all times hereafter they should celebrate it with feasting, joy, and banquets. The Feast of Purim Instituted"
Esther,9,18,"But they that were killing in the city of Susan, were employed in the slaughter on the thirteenth and fourteenth day of the same month: and on the fifteenth day they rested. And therefore they appointed"
Esther,9,19,"But those Jews that dwelt in towns not walled and in villages, appointed the fourteenth day of the month Adar for banquets and gladness, so as to rejoice on that day, and send one another portions of their banquets and meats."
Esther,9,20,"And Mardochai wrote all these things, and sent them comprised in letters to the Jews that abode in"
Esther,9,2121,"That they should receive the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the month Adar for holy days, and always at the return of the year"
Esther,9,22,"Because on those days the Jews revenged themselves of their enemies, and their mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and joy, and that these should be days of feasting and gladness, in which they should send one to another portions of meats; and should give gifts to the poor."
Esther,9,23,"And the Jews undertook to observe with solemnity all they had begun to do at that time, which"
Esther,9,24,"For Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy and adversary of the Jews, had devised evil against them, to kill them and destroy"
Esther,9,25,"And afterwards Esther went in to the king, beseeching him that his endeavours might be made void by the king’s letters: and the evil that he had intended against the Jews, might return upon his own head. And so both he and his sons were hanged upon gibbets."
Esther,9,26,"And since that time these days are called Phurim, that is, of lots: because Phur, that is, the lot, was cast into the urn. And all things that were done, are contained in the volume of this epistle, that is, of"
Esther,9,27,"And the things that they suffered, and that were afterwards changed, the Jews took upon themselves and their seed, and upon all that had a mind to be joined to their religion, so that it should be lawful for none to pass these days without solemnity: which the writing testifieth, and certain times"
Esther,9,28,"These are the days which shall never be forgot: and which all provinces in the whole world shall celebrate throughout all generations: neither is there any city wherein the days of Phurim, that is, of lots, must not be observed by the Jews, and by their posterity, which is bound to these ceremonies."
Esther,9,29,"And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mardochai the Jew, wrote also a second epistle,"
Esther,9,30,"And they sent to all the Jews that were in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of king Assuerus, that they should"
Esther,9,31,"And observe the days of lots, and celebrate them with joy in their proper time: as Mardochai and Esther had appointed, and they undertook them to be observed by"
Esther,9,32,"And all things which are contained in the history of this book, which is called Esther."
Esther,10,1,"And king Assuerus made all the land, and all the islands of the sea tributary."
Esther,10,2,"And his strength and his empire, and the dignity and greatness wherewith he exalted Mardochai, are written in the books of"
Esther,10,3,"And how Mardochai of the race of the Jews, was next after king Assuerus: and great among the Jews, and acceptable to the people of his brethren, seeking the good of his people, and speaking those things which were for the welfare of his seed."
Job,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple and upright,"

Job,1,15,"And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants"
Job,1,16,"And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed"
Job,1,17,"And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them,"
Job,1,18,"He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking"
Job,1,19,"A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to fell thee."
Job,1,20,"Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped,"
Job,1,21,"And said: Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord."
Job,1,22,"In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God."
Job,2,1,"And it came to pass, when on a certain day the sons of God came, and stood before the Lord, and"
Job,2,2,That the Lord said to Satan: Whence comest thou ?
Job,2,3,"And the Lord said to Satan: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man simple, and upright, and fearing Cod, and avoiding evil, and still keeping his innocence ? But thou hast"
Job,2,4,"And Satan answered, and said: Skin for skin, and all that a man hath he will give for his life: 5gut put forth thy hand, and touch his bone"
Job,2,6,"And the Lord said to Satan: Behold be is in thy hand, but yet save his life."
Job,2,7,"So Satan went forth from the presence Of the Lord, and struck Job with a very grievous ulcer, from"
Job,2,8,"And he took a potsherd and scraped the corrupt matter, sitting on a dunghill."
Job,2,9,And his wife said to him: Dost thou still continue in thy simplicity? bless God and die.
Job,2,10,"And he said to her: Thou hast; spoken like one of the foolish women: if we have received good things at the hand of God, why should we not receive evil? In all these things Job did not sin with his lips. Job’s Three Friends"
Job,2,11,"Now when Job’s three friends heard all the evil that had befallen him, they came every one from his own place, Alphas the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite. For they had"
Job,2,12,"And when they had lifted up their eyes afar off, they knew him not, and crying out they wept, and rending their garments they"
Job,2,13,"And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no man spoke to him a word: for they saw that his grief was very great."
Job,3,1,"After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day, 2and he said:"
Job,3,3,"Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived."
Job,3,4,"Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it."
Job,3,5,"Let darkness, and the shadow of death cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness."
Job,3,6,"Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months."
Job,3,7,"Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise."
Job,3,8,Let them curse it who curse the day. who are ready to raise up a leviathan:
Job,3,9,"Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:"
Job,3,10,"Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils from my eyes."
Job,3,11,"Why did I not die in the womb, why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?"
Job,3,12,Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts ?
Job,3,13,"For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep."
Job,3,14,"With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:"
Job,3,15,"Or with princes, that possess gold, and All their houses with silver:"
Job,3,16,"Or as a hidden untimely birth I should not be, or as they that being conceived have not seen the light."
Job,3,17,"There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied in strength are at rest."
Job,3,18,"And they sometime bound together without disquiet, have not heard the voice of the oppressor."
Job,3,19,"The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master."
Job,3,20,"Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that are in bitterness of soul?"
Job,3,21,"That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig for a treasure:"
Job,3,22,And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave.
Job,3,23,"To a man whose way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him with darkness?"
Job,3,24,"Before I eat I sigh: and as overflowing waters, so is my roaring:"
Job,3,25,"For the fear which I feared hath come upon me: and that which I was afraid of, hath befallen me."
Job,3,26,Have I not dissembled ? have I not kept silence ? have I not been quiet? and indignation is come upon me.
Job,4,1,"Then Eliphaz the Themanite answered, and said:"
Job,4,2,"If we begin to speak to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it ill, but who can withhold the words he hath conceived?"
Job,4,3,"Behold thou hast taught many, and thou hast strengthened the weary hands:"
Job,4,4,"Thy words have confirmed them that were staggering, and thou hast strengthened the trembling knees:"

Job,4,6,"Where is thy fear, thy fortitude, thy patience, and the perfection of thy ways?"
Job,4,7,"Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent? or when were the just destroyed?"
Job,4,8,"On the contrary I have seen those who work iniquity, and sow sorrows, and reap them,"
Job,4,9,"Perishing by the blast of God, and consumed by the spirit of his wrath."
Job,4,10,"The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the teeth of the whelps of lions are broken:"

Job,4,13,"In the horror of a vision by night, when deep sleep is wont to hold men,"
Job,4,14,"Fear seized upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were affrighted:"
Job,4,15,"And when a spirit passed before me, the hair of my flesh stood up."
Job,4,16,"There stood one whose countenance I knew not, an image before my eyes, and I heard the voice as it were of a gentle wind:"
Job,4,17,"Shall man be justified in comparison of God, or shall a man be more pure than his maker?"
Job,4,18,"Behold they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found wickedness:"
Job,4,19,"How much more shall they that dwell in houses of clay, who have an earthly foundation, be consumed as with the moth?"
Job,4,20,"From morning till evening they shall be cut down: and because no one understandeth, they shall perish for ever."
Job,4,21,"And they that shall be left, shall be taken away from them: they shall die, and not in wisdom."
Job,5,1,"Call now if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the saints."
Job,5,2,"Anger indeed killeth the foolish, and envy slayeth the little one."

Job,5,8,"Wherefore I will pray to the Lord, and address my speech to God:"
Job,5,9,Who doth great things and unsearchable and wonderful things without number:

Job,5,15,"But he shall save the needy from the sword of their mouth, and the poor from the hand of the violent."
Job,5,16,"And to the needy there shall he hope, but iniquity shall draw in her mouth."

Job,5,27,"Behold, this is even so, as we have searched oat: which thou having heard, consider it thoroughly in thy mind."
Job,6,1,"But Job answered, and said:"
Job,6,2,"O that my sins, whereby I have deserved wrath, and the calamity that I suffer, were weighed in a balance."
Job,6,3,As the sand of the sea this would appear heavier: therefore my words are full of sorrow :
Job,6,4,"For the arrows of the Lord are in me, the rage whereof drinketh up my spirit, and the terrors of the Lord war against me."
Job,6,5,Will the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or will the ox low when he standeth before a full manger?
Job,6,6,"Or can an unsavoury thing be eaten, that is not seasoned with salt? or can a man taste that which when tasted bringeth death?"
Job,6,7,"The things which before my soul would not touch, now, through anguish are my meats."
Job,6,8,Who will grant that my request may come: and that God may give me what I look for?
Job,6,9,"And that he that hath begun may destroy me, that he may let loose his hand, and cut me off?"
Job,6,10,"And that this may be my comfort, that afflicting me with sorrow, he spare not, nor I contradict the words of the Holy One."
Job,6,11,"For what is my strength, that I can hold out? or what is my end that I should keep patience?"
Job,6,12,"My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh of brass."

Job,6,21,Now you are come: and now seeing my affliction you are afraid.
Job,6,22,"Did I say: Bring to me, and give me of your substance?"

Job,11,5,"And I wish that God would speak with thee, and would open his lips to thee,"
Job,11,6,"That he might shew thee the secrets of wisdom, and that his law is manifold, and thou mightest understand that he exacteth much less of thee, than thy iniquity deserveth."

Job,17,15,"Where is now then my expectation, and who considereth my patience?"
Job,17,16,All that I have shall go down into the deepest pit: thinkest thou that there at least I shall have rest?
Job,18,1,"Then Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:"
Job,18,2,"How long will you throw out words? understand first, and so let us speak."
Job,18,3,"Why are we reputed as beasts, and counted vile before you?"
Job,18,4,"Thou that destroyest thy soul in thy fury, shall the earth be forsaken for thee, and shall rocks be removed out of their place?"
Job,18,5,"Shall not the light of the wicked be extinguished, and the flame of his fire not shine?"
Job,18,6,"The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and the lamp that is over him, shall be put out."
Job,18,7,"The step of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down headlong."
Job,18,8,"For he hath thrust his feet into a net, and walketh in its meshes."
Job,18,9,"The sole of his foot shall be held in a snare, and thirst shall burn against him."
Job,18,10,"A gin is hidden for him in the earth, and his trap upon the path."
Job,18,11,"Fears shall terrify him on every side, and shall entangle his feet."
Job,18,12,"Let his strength be wasted with famine, and let hunger invade his ribs."
Job,18,13,"Let it devour the beauty of his skin, let the firstborn death consume his arms."
Job,18,14,"Let his confidence be rooted out of his tabernacle, and let destruction tread upon him like a king."
Job,18,15,"Let the companions of him that is not, dwell in his tabernacle, let brimstone be sprinkled in his tent."
Job,18,16,"Let his roots be dried up beneath, and his harvest destroyed above."
Job,18,17,Let the memory of him perish from the earth and let not his name be renowned in the streets.
Job,18,18,"He shall drive him out of light into darkness, and shall remove him out of the world."
Job,18,19,"His seed shall not subsist, nor his offspring among his people, nor any remnants in his country."
Job,18,20,"They that come after him shall be astonished at his day, and horror shall fall upon them that went before."
Job,18,21,"These men are the tabernacles of the wicked, and this the place of him that knoweth not God."
Job,19,1,"Then Job answered , and said:"
Job,19,2,"How long do you afflict my soul, and break me in pieces with words?"
Job,19,3,"Behold, these ten times you confound me, and are not ashamed to oppress me."
Job,19,4,"For if I have been ignorant, my ignorance shall be with me."
Job,19,5,"But you have set yourselves up against me, and reprove me with my reproaches."
Job,19,6,"At least now understand, that God hath not afflicted me with an equal judgment, and compassed me with his scourges."
Job,19,7,"Behold I cry suffering violence, and no one will hear: I shall cry aloud, and there is none to judge."
Job,19,8,"He hath hedged in my path round about, and I cannot pass, and in my way he hath set darkness."
Job,19,9,"He hath stripped me of my glory, and hath taken the crown from my head."
Job,19,10,"He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am lost, and he hath taken away my hope, as from a tree that is plucked up."
Job,19,11,"His wrath is kindled against me, and he hath counted me as his enemy."
Job,19,12,"His troops have come together, and have made themselves a way by me, and have besieged my tabernacle round about."
Job,19,13,"He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance like strangers have departed from me."
Job,19,14,"My kinsmen have forsaken me, and they that knew me, have forgotten me."
Job,19,15,"They that dwelt in my house, and my maidservants have counted me a stranger, and I have been like an alien in their eyes."
Job,19,16,"I called my servant, and he gave me no answer, I entreated him with my own mouth."
Job,19,17,"My wife hath abhorred my breath, and I entreated the children of my womb."
Job,19,18,"Even fools despise me; and when I gone from them, they spoke against me."
Job,19,19,"They that were sometime my counsellors, have abhorred me: and he whom I love most is turned against me."
Job,19,20,"The flesh being consumed. My bone hath cleaved to my skin, and nothing but lips are left about my teeth."
Job,19,21,"Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you my friends, because the hand of the Lord hath touched me."
Job,19,22,"Why do you persecute me as God, and glut yourselves with my flesh?"
Job,19,23,Who will grant me that my words may be written? Who will grant me that they may be marked down in a book?
Job,19,24,"With an iron pen and in a plate of lead, or else be graven with an instrument in flint stone."
Job,19,25,"For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth."
Job,19,26,"And I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh I will see my God."
Job,19,27,"Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another: this my hope is laid up in my bosom."
Job,19,28,"Why then do you say now: Let us persecute him, and let us find occasion of word against him?"
Job,19,29,"Flee then from the face of the sword, for the sword is the revenger of iniquities: and know ye that there is judgment."
Job,20,1,"Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:"
Job,20,2,"Therefore various thoughts succeed one another in me, and my mind is hurried away to different things."
Job,20,3,"The doctrine with which thou reprovest me, I will hear, and the spirit of my understanding shall answer for me."
Job,20,4,"This I know from the beginning, since man was placed upon the earth, 5that the praise of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment."
Job,20,6,"If his pride mount up even to heaven, and his head touch the clouds:"
Job,20,7,"In the end he shall be destroyed like a dunghill, and they that has seen him shall say: Where is he?"
Job,20,8,"As a dream that fleeth away he shall not be found, he shall pass as a vision of the night:"
Job,20,9,"The eyes that had seen him, shall see him no more, neither shall his place any more behold him."
Job,20,10,"His children shall be oppressed with want, and his hands shall render him his sorrow."
Job,20,11,"His bones shall be filled with the vices of his youth, and they shall sleep with him in the dust."
Job,20,12,"For when evil shall be sweet in his mouth, he will hide it under his tongue."
Job,20,13,"He will spare it, and not leave it, and will hide it in his throat."
Job,20,14,His bread in his belly shall be turned into the gall of asps within him.
Job,20,15,"The riches which he hath swallowed; he shall vomit up, and God shall draw them out of his belly."
Job,20,16,"He shall suck the head of asps, and the viper’s tongue shall kill him. 17(Let him not see the streams of the river, the brooks of honey and of butter.)"
Job,20,18,"He shall be punished for all that he did, and yet shall not be consumed: according to the multitude of his devices so also shall he suffer."
Job,20,19,Because he broke in and stripped the poor: he hath violently taken away a house which he did not build.
Job,20,20,"And yet his belly was not filled: and when he hath the things he coveted, he shall not be able to possess them."
Job,20,21,"There was nothing left of his meat, and therefore nothing shall continue of his goods:"
Job,20,22,"When he shall be filled, he shall be straitened, he shall burn, and every sorrow shall fall upon him."
Job,20,23,"May his belly be filled, that God may send forth the wrath of his indignation upon him, and rain down his war upon him."
Job,20,24,"He shall flee from weapons of iron, and shall fall upon a bow of brass."
Job,20,25,"The sword is drawn out, and cometh forth from its scabbard, and glittereth in his bitterness: the terrible ones shall go and come upon him."
Job,20,26,"All darkness is hid in his secret places: a fire that is not kindled shall devour him, he shall be afflicted when left in his tabernacle."
Job,20,27,"The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him."
Job,20,28,"The offspring of his house shall be exposed, he shall be pulled down in the day of God’s wrath."
Job,20,29,"This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the inheritance of his doings from the Lord."
Job,21,1,"Then Job answered, and said:"
Job,21,2,"Hear, I beseech you, my words, and do penance."
Job,21,3,"Suffer me, and I will speak, and after, if you please, laugh at my words."
Job,21,4,"Is my debate against man, that I should not have just reason to be troubled?"
Job,21,5,"Hearken to me and be astonished, and lay your finger on your mouth."
Job,21,6,"As for me, when I remember, I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh."
Job,21,7,"Why then do the wicked live, are they advanced, and strengthened with riches?"
Job,21,8,"Their seed continueth before them, a multitude of kinsmen, and of children’s children in their sight."
Job,21,9,"Their houses are secure and peaceable, and the rod of God is not upon them."
Job,21,10,"Their cattle have conceived, and failed not: their cow has calved, and is not deprived of her fruit."
Job,21,11,"Their little ones go out like a flock, and their children dance and play."
Job,21,12,"They take the timbrel, and the harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ."
Job,21,13,"They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment they go down to hell."
Job,21,14,"Who have said to God: Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways."
Job,21,15,"Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what doth it profit us if we pray to him?"
Job,21,16,"Yet because their good things are not in their hand, may the counsel of the wicked be far from me."
Job,21,17,"How often shall the lamp of the wicked be put out, and a deluge come upon them, and he shall distribute the sorrows of his wrath?"
Job,21,18,"They shall be as chaff before the face of the wind, and as ashes which the whirlwind scattereth."
Job,21,19,"God shall lay up the sorrow of the father for his children: and when he shall repay, then shall he know."
Job,21,20,"His eyes shall see his own destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
Job,21,21,For what is it to him what befalleth his house after him: and if the number of his months be diminished by one half?
Job,21,22,"Shall any one teach God knowledge, who judgeth those that are high?"
Job,21,23,"One man dieth strong, and hale, rich and happy."
Job,21,24,"His bowels are full of fat, and his bones are moistened with marrow."
Job,21,25,But another dieth in bitterness of soul without any riches:
Job,21,26,"And yet they shall sleep together in the dust, and worms shall cover them."
Job,21,27,"Surely I know your thoughts, and your unjust judgments against me."
Job,21,28,For you say: Where is the house of the prince ? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?
Job,21,29,"Ask any one of them that go by the way, and you shall perceive that he knoweth these same things."
Job,21,30,"Because the wicked man is reserved to the day of destruction, and he shall be brought to the day of wrath."
Job,21,31,Who shall reprove his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
Job,21,32,"He shall be brought to the graves, and shall watch in the heap of the dead."
Job,21,33,"He hath been acceptable to the gravel of Cocytus, and he shall draw every man after him, and there are innumerable before him."
Job,21,34,"How then do ye comfort me in vain, whereas your answer is shewn to be repugnant to truth ?"
Job,22,1,"Then Eliphaz the Themanite answered, and said:"
Job,22,2,"Can man be compared with God, even though he were of perfect knowledge?"
Job,22,3,What doth it profit God if thou be just? or what dost thou give him if thy way be unspotted?
Job,22,4,"Shall he reprove thee for fear, and come with thee into judgment:"
Job,22,5,"And not for thy manifold wickedness, and thy infinite iniquities?"
Job,22,6,"For thou hast taken away the pledge of thy brethren without cause, and stripped the naked of their clothing."
Job,22,7,"Thou hast not given water to the weary, thou hast withdrawn bread from the hungry."
Job,22,8,"In the strength of thy arm thou didst possess the land, and being the most mighty thou holdest it."
Job,22,9,"Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless thou hast broken in pieces."
Job,22,10,"Therefore art thou surrounded with snares, and sudden fear troubleth thee."
Job,22,11,"And didst thou think that thou shouldst not see darkness, and that thou shouldst not be covered with the violence of overflowing waters?"
Job,22,12,"Dost not thou think that God is higher than heaven, and is elevated above the height of the stars?"
Job,22,13,And thou sayst: What doth God know? and he judgeth as it were through a mist.
Job,22,14,"The clouds are his covert, and he doth not consider our things, and he walketh about the poles of heaven."
Job,22,15,"Dost thou desire to keep the path of ages, which wicked men have trodden?"
Job,22,16,"Who were taken away before their time, and a flood hath overthrown their foundation."
Job,22,17,Who said to God: Depart from us: and looked upon the Almighty as if he could do nothing:
Job,22,18,Whereas he had filled their houses with good things: whose way of thinking be far from me.
Job,22,19,"The just shall see, and shall rejoice, and the innocent shall laugh them to scorn."
Job,22,20,"Is not their exaltation cut down, and hath not fire devoured the remnants of them?"
Job,22,21,"Submit thyself then to him, and be at peace: and thereby thou shalt have the best fruits."
Job,22,22,"Receive the law of his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart."
Job,22,23,"If thou wilt return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, and shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacle."
Job,22,24,"He shall give for earth flint, and for flint torrents of gold."
Job,22,25,"And the Almighty shall be against thy enemies, and silver shall be heaped together for thee."
Job,22,26,"Then shalt thou abound in delights in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face to God."
Job,22,27,"Thou shalt pray to him, and he will hear thee, and thou shalt pay vows."
Job,22,28,"Thou shalt decree a thing, and it I shall come to thee, and light shall shine in thy ways."
Job,22,29,"For he that hath been humbled, shall be in glory: and he that shall bow down his eyes, he shall be saved."
Job,22,30,"The innocent shall be saved, and he shall be saved by the cleanness of his hands."
Job,23,1,"Then Job answered, and said:"
Job,23,2,"Now also my words are in bitterness, and the hand of my scourge is more grievous than my mourning."
Job,23,3,"Who will grant me that I might know and find him, and come even to his throne?"
Job,23,4,"I would set judgment before him, and would fill my mouth with complaints."
Job,23,5,"That I might know the words that he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me."
Job,23,6,"I would not that he should contend with me with much strength, nor overwhelm me with the weight of his greatness."
Job,23,7,"Let him propose equity against me, and let my judgment come to victory."
Job,23,8,"But if I go to the east, he appeareth not; if to the west, I shall not understand him."
Job,23,9,"If to the left hand, what shall I do? I shall not take hold on him: if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him."
Job,23,10,"But he knoweth my way, and has tried me as gold that passeth through the fire:"
Job,23,11,"My foot hath followed his steps, I have kept his way, and have not declined from it."
Job,23,12,"I have not departed from the commandments of his lips, and the words of his mouth I have hid in my bosom."
Job,23,13,"For he is alone, and no man can turn away his thought: and whatsoever is soul hath desired, that hath he done."
Job,23,14,"And when he shall have fulfilled his will in me, many other like things are also at hand with him."
Job,23,15,"And therefore I am troubled at his presence, and when I consider him I am made pensive with fear."
Job,23,16,"God hath softened my heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me."
Job,23,17,"For I have not perished because of the darkness that hangs over me, neither hath the mist covered my face."
Job,24,1,"Times are not hid from the Almighty: but they that know him, know not his days."
Job,24,2,"Some have removed landmarks, have taken away flocks by force, and fed them."
Job,24,3,"They have driven away the ass of the fatherless, and have taken away the widow’s ox for a pledge."
Job,24,4,"They have overturned the way of the poor, and have oppressed together the meek of the earth."
Job,24,5,Others like wild asses in the desert go forth to their work: by watching for a prey they get bread for their children.
Job,24,6,"They reap the field that is not their own, and gather the vintage of his vineyard whom by violence they have oppressed."
Job,24,7,"They send men away naked, taking away their clothes who have no covering in the cold:"
Job,24,8,"Who are wet, with the showers of the mountains, and having no covering embrace the stones."
Job,24,9,"They have violently robbed the fatherless, and stripped the poor common people."
Job,24,10,"From the naked and them that go without clothing, and from the hungry they have taken away the ears of corn."
Job,24,11,"They have taken their rest at noon among the stores of them, who after having trodden the winepresses suffer thirst."
Job,24,12,"Out of the cities they have made men to groan, and the soul of the wounded hath cried out, and God doth not suffer it to pass unrevenged."
Job,24,13,"They have been rebellious to the light, they have not known his ways, neither have they returned by his paths."
Job,24,14,"The murderer riseth at the very break of day, he killeth the needy, and the poor man: but in the night he will be as a thief."
Job,24,15,"The eye of the adulterer observeth darkness, saying: No eye shall see me: and he will cover his face."
Job,24,16,"He diggeth through houses in the dark, as in the day they had appointed for themselves, and they have not known the light."
Job,24,17,"If the morning suddenly appear, it is to them the shadow of death: and they walk in darkness as if it were in light."
Job,24,18,"He is light upon the face of the water: cursed be his portion on the earth, let him not walk by the way of the vineyards."
Job,24,19,"Let him pass from the snow waters to excessive heat, and his sin even to hell."
Job,24,20,"Let mercy forget him: may worms be his sweetness: let him be remembered no more, but be broken in pieces as an unfruitful tree."
Job,24,21,"For he hath fed the barren that beareth not, and to the widow he hath done no good."
Job,24,22,"He hath pulled down the strong by his might: and when he standeth up, he shall not trust to his life."
Job,24,23,"God hath given him place for penance, and he abuseth it unto pride: but his eyes are upon his ways."
Job,24,24,"They are lifted up for a little while and shall not stand, and shall be brought down as all things, and shall be taken away, and as the tops of the ears of corn they shall be broken."
Job,24,25,"And if it be not so, who can convince me that I have lied, and set my words before God?"
Job,25,1,"Then Baldad the Suhite answered, and I said:"
Job,25,2,"Power and terror are with him, who maketh peace in his high places."
Job,25,3,Is there any numbering of his soldiers? and upon whom shall not his light arise?
Job,25,4,"Can man be justified compared with God, or he that is born of a woman appear clean?"
Job,25,5,"Behold even the moon doth not shine, and the stars are not pure in his sight."
Job,25,6,How much less man that is rottenness and the son of man who is a worm?
Job,26,1,"Then Job answered, and said:"
Job,26,2,Whose helper art thou? is it of him that is weak? and dost thou hold up the arm of him that has no strength?
Job,26,3,"To whom hast thou given counsel? perhaps to him that hath no wisdom, and thou hast shewn thy very great prudence."
Job,26,4,Whom hast thou desired to teach? was it not him that made life?
Job,26,5,"Behold the giants groan under the waters, and they that dwell with them."
Job,26,6,"Hell is naked before him, and there is no covering for destruction."
Job,26,7,"He stretched out the north over the empty space, and hangeth the earth upon nothing."
Job,26,8,"He bindeth up the waters in his clouds, so that they break not out and fall down together."
Job,26,9,"He withholdeth the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud over it."

Job,26,11,"The pillars of heaven tremble, and dread at his beck."
Job,26,12,"By his power the seas are suddenly gathered together, and his wisdom has struck the proud one."
Job,26,13,"His spirit hath adorned the heavens, and his obstetric hand brought forth the winding serpent."
Job,26,14,"Lo, these things are said in part of his ways: and seeing we have heard scarce a little drop of his word, who shall be able to behold the thunder of his greatness?"
Job,27,1,"Job also added, taking up his parable, and said:"
Job,27,2,"As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment, and the Almighty, who hath brought my soul to bitterness,"
Job,27,3,"As long as breath remaineth in me, and the spirit of God in my nostrils,"
Job,27,4,"My lips shall not speak iniquity, neither shall my tongue contrive lying."
Job,27,5,God forbid that I should judge you to be just: till I die I will not depart from my innocence.
Job,27,6,"My justification, which I have begun to hold, I will not forsake: for my heart doth not reprehend me in all my life. The Wicked Man’s Portion"
Job,27,7,"Let my enemy be as the ungodly, and my adversary as the wicked one."
Job,27,8,"For what is the hope of the hypocrite if through covetousness he take by violence, and God deliver not his soul?"
Job,27,9,"Will God hear his cry, when distress shall come upon him?"
Job,27,10,"Or can he delight himself in the Almighty, and call upon God at all times?"
Job,27,11,"I will teach you by the hand of God, what the Almighty hath, and I will not conceal it."
Job,27,12,"Behold you all know it, and why do you speak vain things without cause?"
Job,27,13,"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the inheritance of the violent, which they shall receive of the Almighty."
Job,27,14,"If his sons be multiplied, they shall be for the sword, and his grandsons shall not be filled with bread."
Job,27,15,"They that shall remain of him, shall be buried in death, and his widows shall not weep."
Job,27,16,"If he shall heap together silver as earth, and prepare raiment as clay,"
Job,27,17,"He shall prepare indeed, but the just man shall be clothed with it: and the innocent shall divide the silver."
Job,27,18,"He hath built his house as a moth, and as a keeper he hath made a booth."
Job,27,19,The rich man when he shall sleep shall take away nothing with him: he shall open his eyes and find nothing.
Job,27,20,"Poverty like water shall take hold on him, a tempest shall oppress him in the night."
Job,27,21,"A burning wind shall take him up, and carry him away, and as a whirlwind shall snatch him from his place."
Job,27,22,"And he shall cast upon him, and shall not spare: out of his hand he would willingly flee."
Job,27,23,"He shall clasp his hands upon him, and shall hiss at him, beholding his place."
Job,28,1,"Silver hath beginnings of its veins, and gold hath a place wherein it is melted."
Job,28,2,"Iron is taken out of the earth, and stone melted with heat is turned into brass."
Job,28,3,"He hath set a time for darkness, and the end of all things he considereth, the stone also that is in the dark and the shadow of death."
Job,28,4,"The flood divideth from the people that are on their journey, those whom the food of the needy man hath forgotten, and who cannot be come at."
Job,28,5,"The land, out of which bread grew in its place, hath been overturned with fire."
Job,28,6,"The stones of it are the place of sapphires, and the clods of it are gold."
Job,28,7,"The bird hath not known the path, neither hath the eye of the vulture beheld it."
Job,28,8,"The children of the merchants have not trodden it, neither hath the lioness passed by it."
Job,28,9,"He hath stretched forth his hand to the flint, he hath overturned mountains from the roots."
Job,28,10,"In the rocks he hath cut out rivers, and his eye hath seen every precious thing."
Job,28,11,"The depths also of rivers he hath searched, and hidden things he hath brought forth to light."
Job,28,12,"But where is wisdom to be found, and where is the place of understanding?"
Job,28,13,"Man knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it found in the land of them that live in delights."
Job,28,14,The depth saith: It is not in me: and the sea saith: It is not with me.
Job,28,15,"The finest gold shall not purchase it, neither shall silver be weighed in exchange for it"
Job,28,16,"It shall not be compared with the dyed colours of India, or with the most precious stone sardonyx, or the sapphire."
Job,28,17,"Gold or crystal cannot equal it, neither shall any vessels of gold be changed for it."
Job,28,18,High and eminent things shall not be mentioned in comparison of it: but wisdom is drawn out of secret places.
Job,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be equal to it, neither shall it be compared to the cleanest dyeing."
Job,28,20,Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?
Job,28,21,It is hid from the eyes of all living. and the fowls of the air know it not.
Job,28,22,Destruction and death have said: With our ears we have heard the fame thereof.
Job,28,23,"God understandeth the way of it, and he knoweth the place thereof."
Job,28,24,For he beholdeth the ends of the world: and looketh on all things that are under heaven.
Job,28,25,Who made a weight for the winds and weighed the waters by measure.
Job,28,26,"When he gave a law for the rain, and a way for the sounding storms."
Job,28,27,"Then he saw it, and declared, and prepared, and searched it."
Job,28,28,"And he said to man: Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom: and to depart from evil, is understanding."
Job,29,1,"Job also added, taking up his parable, and said:"
Job,29,2,"Who will grant me, that I might be according to the months past, according to the days in which God kept me?"
Job,29,3,"When his lamp shined over my head, and I walked by his light in darkness?"
Job,29,4,"As I was in the days of my youth, when God was secretly in my tabernacle?"
Job,29,5,When the Almighty was with me: and my servants round about me?
Job,29,6,"When I washed my feet with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil?"
Job,29,7,"When I went out to the gate of the city, and in the street they prepared me a chair?"
Job,29,8,"The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the old men rose up and stood."
Job,29,9,"The princes ceased to speak, and laid the finger on their mouth."
Job,29,10,"The rulers held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to their throat."
Job,29,11,"The ear that heard me blessed me, and the eye that saw me gave witness to me:"
Job,29,12,Because I had delivered the poor man that cried out; and the fatherless that had no helper.
Job,29,13,"The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I comforted the heart of the widow."
Job,29,14,"I was clad with justice: and I clothed myself with my judgment, as with a robe and a diadem."
Job,29,15,"I was an eye to the blind, and a foot to the lame."
Job,29,16,"I was the father of the poor: and the cause which I knew not, I searched out most diligently."
Job,29,17,"I broke the jaws of the wicked man, and out of his teeth I took away the prey."
Job,29,18,"And I said: I shall die in my nest, and as a palm tree shall multiply my days."
Job,29,19,"My root is opened beside the waters, and dew shall continue in my harvest."
Job,29,20,"My glory shall always be renewed, and my bow in my hand shall be repaired."
Job,29,21,"They that heard me, waited for my sentence, and being attentive held their peace at my counsel."
Job,29,22,"To my words they durst add nothing, and my speech dropped upon them."
Job,29,23,"They waited for me as for rain, and they opened their mouth as for a latter shower."
Job,29,24,"If at any time I laughed on them, they believed not, and the light of my countenance fell not on earth."
Job,29,25,"If I had a mind to go to them, I sat first, and when I sat as a king, with his army standing about him, yet I was a comforter of them that mourned."
Job,30,1,"But now the younger in time scorn me, whose fathers I would not have set with the dogs of my flock:"
Job,30,2,"The strength of whose hands was to me as nothing, and they were thought unworthy of life itself."
Job,30,3,"Barren with want and hunger, who gnawed in the wilderness, disfigured with calamity and misery."
Job,30,4,"And they ate grass, and barks of trees, and the root of junipers was their food."
Job,30,5,"Who snatched up these things out of the valleys, and when they had found any of them, they ran to them with a cry."
Job,30,6,"They dwelt in the desert places of torrents, and in caves of earth, or upon the gravel."
Job,30,7,"They pleased themselves among these kind of things, and counted it delightful to be under the briers."
Job,30,8,"The children of foolish and base men, and not appearing at all upon the earth."
Job,30,9,"Now I am turned into their song, and am become their byword."
Job,30,10,"They abhor me, and flee far from me, and are not afraid to spit in my face."
Job,30,11,"For he hath opened his quiver, and hath afflicted me, and hath put a bridle into my mouth."
Job,30,12,"At the right hand of my rising, my calamities forthwith arose: they have overthrown my feet, and have overwhelmed me with their paths as with waves."
Job,30,13,"They have destroyed my ways, they have lain in wait against me, and they have prevailed, and there was none to help."
Job,30,14,"They have rushed in upon me, as when a wall is broken, and a gate opened, and have rolled themselves down to my miseries. Job’s Prosperity Becomes Calamity"
Job,30,15,I am brought to nothing: as a wind thou hast taken away my desire: and my prosperity hath passed away like a cloud.
Job,30,16,"And now my soul fadeth within myself, and the days of affliction possess me."
Job,30,17,"In the night my bone is pierced with sorrows: and they that feed upon me, do not sleep."
Job,30,18,"With the multitude of them my garment is consumed, and they have girded me about, as with the collar of my coat."
Job,30,19,"I am compared to dirt, and am likened to embers and ashes."
Job,30,20,"I cry to thee, and thou hearest me not: I stand up, and thou dost not regard me."
Job,30,21,"Thou art changed to be cruel toward me, and in the hardness of thy hand thou art against me."
Job,30,22,"Thou hast lifted me up, and set me as it were upon the wind, and thou hast mightily dashed me."
Job,30,23,"I know that thou wilt deliver me to death, where a house is appointed for every one that liveth."
Job,30,24,But yet thou stretchest not forth thy hand to their consumption: and if they shall fall down thou wilt save.
Job,30,25,"I wept heretofore for him that was afflicted, and my soul had compassion on the poor."
Job,30,26,"I expected good things, and evils are come upon me: I waited for light, and darkness broke out."
Job,30,27,"My inner parts have boiled without any rest, the days of affliction have prevented me."
Job,30,28,"I went mourning without indignation; I rose up, and cried in the crowd."
Job,30,29,"I was the brother of dragons, and companion of ostriches."
Job,30,30,"My skin is become black upon me, and my bones are dried up with heat."
Job,30,31,"My harp is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of those that weep."
Job,31,1,"I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin."
Job,31,2,"For what part should God from above have in me, and what inheritance the Almighty from on high?"
Job,31,3,"Is not destruction to the wicked, and aversion to them that work iniquity?"
Job,31,4,"Doth not he consider my ways, and number all my steps?"
Job,31,5,"If I have walked in vanity, and my foot hath made haste to deceit:"
Job,31,6,"Let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicity."
Job,31,7,"If my step hath turned out of the way, and if my heart hath followed my eyes, and if a spot hath cleaved to my hands:"
Job,31,8,Then let me sow and let another eat: and let my offspring be rooted out.
Job,31,9,"If my heart hath been deceived upon a woman, and if I have laid wait at my friend’s door:"
Job,31,10,"Let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men lie with her."
Job,31,11,"For this is a heinous crime, and a most grievous iniquity."
Job,31,12,"It is a fire that devoureth even to destruction, and rooteth up all things that spring."
Job,31,13,"If I have despised to abide judgment with my manservant, or my maidservant, when they had any controversy against me:"
Job,31,14,"For what shall I do when God shall rise to judge? and when he shall examine, what shall I answer him?"
Job,31,15,Did not he that made me in the womb make him also: and did not one and the same form me in the womb?
Job,31,16,"If I have denied to the poor what they desired, and have made the eyes of the widow wait:"
Job,31,17,"If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof: 18(For from my infancy mercy grew up with me: and it came out with me from my mother’s womb :)"
Job,31,19,"If I have despised him that was perishing for want of clothing, and the poor man that had no covering:"
Job,31,20,"If his sides have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep:"
Job,31,21,"If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, even when I saw myself superior in the gate:"
Job,31,22,"Let my shoulder fall from its joint, and let my arm with its bones be broken."
Job,31,23,"For I have always feared God as waves swelling over me, and his weight I was not able to bear."
Job,31,24,"If I have thought gold my strength, and have said to fine gold: My confidence:"
Job,31,25,"If I have rejoiced over my great riches, and because my hand had gotten much."
Job,31,26,"If I beheld the sun when it shined, and the moon going in brightness:"
Job,31,27,"And my heart in secret hath rejoiced, and I have kissed my hand with my mouth:"
Job,31,28,"Which is a very great iniquity, and a denial against the most high God."
Job,31,29,"If I have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me, and have rejoiced that evil had found him."
Job,31,30,"For I have not given my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse to his soul."
Job,31,31,If the men of my tabernacle have not said: Who will give us of his flesh that we may be filled?
Job,31,32,"The stranger did not stay without, my door was open to the traveller."
Job,31,33,"If as a man I have hid my sin, and have concealed my iniquity in my bosom."
Job,31,34,"If I have been afraid at a very great multitude, and the contempt of kinsmen hath terrified me: and I have not rather held my peace, and not gone out of the door."
Job,31,35,"Who would grant me a hearer, that the Almighty may hear my desire; and that he himself that judgeth would write a book,"
Job,31,36,"That I may carry it on my shoulder, and put it about me as a crown?"
Job,31,37,"At every step of mine I would pronounce it, and offer it as to a prince."
Job,31,38,"If my land cry against me, and with it the furrows thereof mourn:"
Job,31,39,"If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, and have afflicted the soul of the tillers thereof:"
Job,31,40,"Let thistles grow up to me instead of wheat, and thorns instead of barley."
Job,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he seemed just to himself."
Job,32,2,"And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, was angry and was moved to indignation : now he was"
Job,32,3,And he was angry with his friends because
Job,32,4,So Eliu waited while Job was
Job,32,5,"But when he saw that the three were not able to answer, he was exceedingly angry."
Job,32,6,"Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said : I am younger in days, and you are more ancient; therefore hanging down my head, I was afraid to shew you my opinion."
Job,32,7,"For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom."
Job,32,8,"But, as I see, there is a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding."
Job,32,9,"They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment."
Job,32,10,"Therefore I will speak : Hearken to me, I also will shew you my wisdom."
Job,32,11,"For I have waited for your words, I have given ear to your wisdom, as long as you were disputing in words."
Job,32,12,"And as long as I thought you said some thing, I considered : but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince Job, and answer his words."
Job,32,13,"Lest you should say : We have found wisdom, God hath cast him down, not man."
Job,32,14,"He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your words."
Job,32,15,"They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking."
Job,32,16,"Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken : they stood, and answered no more :"
Job,32,17,"I also will answer my part, and will shew my knowledge. 18"
Job,32,19,"Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which bursteth the new vessels."
Job,32,20,"I will speak and take breath a little : I will open my lips, and will answer."
Job,32,21,"I will not accept the person of man, and I will not level God with man."
Job,32,22,"For I know not how long I shall continue, and whether after a while my Maker may take me away."
Job,33,1,"Hear therefore, O Job, my speeches, and hearken to all my words."
Job,33,2,"Behold now I have opened my mouth, let my tongue speak within my jaws."
Job,33,3,"My words are from my upright heart, and my lips shall speak a pure sentence."
Job,33,4,"The spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life."
Job,33,5,"If thou canst, answer me, and stand up against my face."
Job,33,6,"Behold God hath made me as well as thee, and of the same clay I also was formed."
Job,33,7,"But yet let not my wonder terrify thee, and let not my eloquence be burdensome to thee."
Job,33,8,"Now thou has said in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words :"
Job,33,9,"I am clean, and without sin : I am unspotted, and there is no iniquity in me."
Job,33,10,"Because he hath found complaints against me, therefore he hath counted me for his enemy."
Job,33,11,"He hath put my feet in the stocks, he hath observed all my paths."
Job,33,12,"Now this is the thing in which thou art not justified : I will answer thee, that God is greater than man."
Job,33,13,"Dost thou strive against him, because he hath not answered thee to all words?"
Job,33,14,"God speaketh once, and repeateth not the selfsame thing the second time."
Job,33,15,"By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, and they are sleeping in their beds :"
Job,33,16,"Then he openeth the ears of men, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn."
Job,33,17,"That he may withdraw a man from the things he is doing, and may deliver him from pride."
Job,33,18,Rescuing his soul from corruption : and his life from passing to the sword.
Job,33,19,"He rebuketh also by sorrow in the bed, and he maketh all his bones to wither."
Job,33,20,"Bread becometh abominable to him in his life, and to his soul the meat which before he desired."
Job,33,21,"His flesh shall be consumed away, and his bones that were covered shall be made bare."
Job,33,22,"His soul hath drawn near to corruption, and his life to the destroyers."
Job,33,23,"If there shall be an angel speaking for him, one among thousands, to declare man’s uprightness,"
Job,33,24,"He shall have mercy on him, and shall say : Deliver him, that he may not go down to corruption : I have found wherein I may be merciful to him."
Job,33,25,"His flesh is consumed with punishment, let him return to the days of his youth."
Job,33,26,"He shall pray to God, and he will be gracious to him : and he shall see his face with joy, and he will render to man his justice."
Job,33,27,"He shall look upon men, and shall say : I have sinned, and indeed I have offended, and I have not received what I have deserved."
Job,33,28,"He hath delivered his soul from going into destruction, that it may live and see the light."
Job,33,29,"Behold, all these things God worketh three times within every one."
Job,33,30,"That he may withdraw their souls from corruption, and enlighten them with the light of the living."
Job,33,31,"Attend, Job, and hearken to me : and hold thy peace, whilst I speak."
Job,33,32,"But if thou hast any thing to say, answer me, speak : for I would have thee to appear just."
Job,33,33,"And if thou have not, hear me : hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom."
Job,34,1,"And Eliu continued his discourse, and said :"
Job,34,2,"Hear ye, wise men, my words, and ye learned, hearken to me :"
Job,34,3,"For the ear trieth words, and the mouth discerneth meats by the taste."
Job,34,4,"Let us choose to us judgment, and let us see among ourselves what is the best."
Job,34,5,"For Job hath said : I am just, and God hath overthrown my judgment."
Job,34,6,For in judging me there is a lie : my arrow is violent without any sin.
Job,34,7,"What man is there like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?"
Job,34,8,"Who goeth in company with them that work iniquity, and walketh with wicked men?"
Job,34,9,"For he hath said : Man shall not please God, although he run with him."
Job,34,10,"Therefore, ye men of understanding, hear me : far from god be wickedness, and iniquity from the Almighty."
Job,34,11,"For he will render to a man his work, and according to the ways of every one he will reward them."
Job,34,12,"For in very deed God will not condemn without cause, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment."
Job,34,13,What other hath he appointed over the earth? or whom hath he set over the world which he made?
Job,34,14,"If he turn his heart to him, he shall draw his spirit and breath unto himself."
Job,34,15,"All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return into ashes."
Job,34,16,"If then thou hast understanding, hear what is said, and hearken to the voice of my words."
Job,34,17,Can he be healed that loveth not judgment? and how dost thou so far condemn him that is just?
Job,34,18,Who saith to the king : Thou art an apostate : who calleth rulers ungodly?
Job,34,19,"Who accepteth not the persons of princes : nor hath regarded the tyrant, when he contended against the poor man : for all are the work of his hands."
Job,34,20,"They shall suddenly die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and they shall pass, and take away the violent without hand."
Job,34,21,"For his eyes are upon the ways of men, and he considereth all their steps."
Job,34,22,"There is no darkness, and there is no shadow of death, where they may be hid who work iniquity."
Job,34,23,For it is no longer in the power of man to enter into judgment with God.
Job,34,24,"He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead."
Job,34,25,"For he knoweth their works : and therefore he shall bring night on them, and they shall be destroyed."
Job,34,26,"He hath struck them, as being wicked, in open sight."
Job,34,27,"Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and would not understand all his ways :"
Job,34,28,"So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him, and he heard the voice of the poor."
Job,34,29,"For when he granteth peace, who is there that can condemn? When he hideth his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it regard nations, or all men?"
Job,34,30,Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people?
Job,34,31,"Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee in thy turn."
Job,34,32,"If I have erred, teach thou me : if I have spoken iniquity, I will add no more."
Job,34,33,"Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou begannest to speak, and not I. : but if thou know any thing better, speak."
Job,34,34,"Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hearken to me."
Job,34,35,"But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not discipline."
Job,34,36,"My father, let Job be tried even to the end : cease not from the man of iniquity."
Job,34,37,"Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be tied fast in the mean time amongst us : and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches."
Job,35,1,Moreover Eliu spoke these words :
Job,35,2,"Doth thy thought seem right to thee, that thou shouldst say : I am more just than God?"
Job,35,3,For thou saidst : That which is right doth not please thee : or what will it profit thee if I sin?
Job,35,4,"Therefore I will answer thy words, and thy friends with thee."
Job,35,5,"Look up to heaven and see, and behold the sky, that it is higher than thee."
Job,35,6,"If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt him? and if thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against him?"
Job,35,7,"And if thou do justly, what shalt thou give him, or what shall he receive of thy hand?"
Job,35,8,Thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee : and thy justice may help the son of man.
Job,35,9,By reason of the multitude of oppressions they shall cry out : and shall wail for the violence of the arm of tyrants.
Job,35,10,"And he hath not said : Where is God, who made me, who hath given songs in the night?"
Job,35,11,"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and instructeth us more than the fowls of the air."
Job,35,12,"There shall they cry, and he will not hear, because of the pride of evil men."
Job,35,13,"God therefore will not hear in vain, and the Almighty will look into the causes of every one."
Job,35,14,"Yea when thou shalt say : He considereth not : be judged before him, and expect him."
Job,35,15,"For he doth not now bring on his fury, neither doth he revenge wickedness exceedingly."
Job,35,16,"Therefore Job openeth his mouth in vain, and multiplieth words without knowledge."
Job,36,1,"Eliu also proceeded, and said :"
Job,36,2,"Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee : for I have yet somewhat to speak in God’s behalf."
Job,36,3,"I will repeat my knowledge from the beginning, and I will prove my Maker just."
Job,36,4,"For indeed my words are without a lie, and perfect knowledge shall be proved to thee."
Job,36,5,"God doth not cast away the mighty, whereas he himself also is mighty."
Job,36,6,"But he saveth not the wicked, and he giveth judgment to the poor."
Job,36,7,"He will not take away his eyes from the just, and he placeth kings on the throne for ever, and they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"And if they shall be in chains, and be bound with the cords of poverty :"
Job,36,9,"He shall shew them their works, and their wicked deeds, because they have been violent."
Job,36,10,"He also shall open their ear, to correct them : and shall speak, that they may return from iniquity."
Job,36,11,"If they shall hear and observe, they shall accomplish their days in good, and their years in glory."
Job,36,12,"But if they hear not, they shall pass by the sword, and shall be consumed in folly."
Job,36,13,"Dissemblers and crafty men prove the wrath of God, neither shall they cry when they are bound."
Job,36,14,"Their soul shall die in a storm, and their life among the effeminate."
Job,36,15,"He shall deliver the poor out of his distress, and shall open his ear in affliction."
Job,36,16,"Therefore he shall set thee at large out of the narrow mouth, and which hath no foundation under it : and the rest of thy table shall be full of fatness."
Job,36,17,"Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked, cause and judgment thou shalt recover."
Job,36,18,Therefore let not anger overcome thee to oppress any man : neither let multitude of gifts turn thee aside.
Job,36,19,"Lay down thy greatness without tribulation, and all the mighty of strength."
Job,36,20,Prolong not the night that people may come up for them.
Job,36,21,Beware thou turn not aside to iniquity : for this thou hast begun to follow after misery.
Job,36,22,"Behold, God is high in his strength, and none is like him among the lawgivers."
Job,36,23,Who can search out his ways? or who can say to him : Thou has wrought iniquity?
Job,36,24,"Remember that thou knowest not his work, concerning which men have sung."
Job,36,25,"All men see him, every one beholdeth afar off."
Job,36,26,"Behold, God is great, exceeding our knowledge : the number of his years is inestimable."
Job,36,27,"He lifteth up the drops of rain, and poureth out showers like floods :"
Job,36,28,Which flow from the clouds that cover all above.
Job,36,29,"If he will spread out clouds as his tent,"
Job,36,30,"And lighten with his light from above, he shall cover also the ends of the sea."
Job,36,31,"For by these he judgeth people, and giveth food to many mortals."
Job,36,32,"In his hands he hideth the light, and commandeth it to come again."
Job,36,33,"He sheweth his friend concerning it, that it is his possession, and that he may come up to it."
Job,37,1,"At this my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place."
Job,37,2,"Hear ye attentively the terror of his voice, and the sound that cometh out of his mouth."
Job,37,3,"He beholdeth under all the heavens, and his light is upon the ends of the earth."
Job,37,4,"After it a noise shall roar, he shall thunder with the voice of his majesty, and shall not be found out, when his voice shall be heard."
Job,37,5,"God shall thunder wonderfully with his voice, he that doth great and unsearchable things."
Job,37,6,"He commandeth the snow to go down upon the earth, and the winter rain, and the shower of his strength."
Job,37,7,"He sealeth up the hand of all men, that every one may know his works."
Job,37,8,"Then the beast shall go into his covert, and shall abide in his den."
Job,37,9,"Out of the inner parts shall a tempest come, and cold out of the north."
Job,37,10,"When God bloweth there cometh frost, and again the waters are poured out abundantly."
Job,37,11,"Corn desireth clouds, and the clouds spread their light :"
Job,37,12,"Which go round about, whithersoever the will of him that governeth them shall lead them, to whatsoever he shall command them upon the face of the whole earth :"
Job,37,13,"Whether in one tribe, or in his own land, or in what place soever of his mercy he shall command them to be found."
Job,37,14,"Hearken to these things, Job : Stand, and consider the wondrous works of God."
Job,37,15,"Dost thou know when God commanded the rains, to shew his light of his clouds?"
Job,37,16,"Knowest thou the great paths of the clouds, and the perfect knowledges?"
Job,37,17,"Are not thy garments hot, when the south wind blows upon the earth?"
Job,37,18,"Thou perhaps hast made the heavens with him, which are most strong, as if they were of molten brass."
Job,37,19,Shew us what we may say to him : for we are wrapped up in darkness.
Job,37,20,"Who shall tell him the things I speak? even if a man shall speak, he shall be swallowed up."
Job,37,21,"But now they see not the light : the air on a sudden shall be thickened into clouds, and the wind shall pass and drive them away."
Job,37,22,"Cold cometh out of the north, and to God praise with fear."
Job,37,23,"We cannot find him worthily : he is great in strength, and in judgment, and in justice, and he is ineffable."
Job,37,24,"Therefore men shall fear him, and all that seem to themselves to be wise, shall not dare to behold him."
Job,38,1,"Then the Lord answered Job out of a whirlwind, and said :"
Job,38,2,Who is this that wrappeth up sentences in unskillful words?
Job,38,3,"Gird up thy loins like a man : I will ask thee, and answer thou me."
Job,38,4,Where wast thou when I laid up the foundations of the earth ? tell me if thou hast understanding.
Job,38,5,"Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?"
Job,38,6,"Upon what are its bases grounded? or who laid the corner stone thereof,"
Job,38,7,"When the morning stars praised me together, and all the sons of God made a joyful melody?"
Job,38,8,"Who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth as issuing out of the womb : 9when I made a cloud the garment thereof, and wrapped it in a mist as in swaddling bands?"
Job,38,10,"I set my bounds around it, and made it bars and doors :"
Job,38,11,"And I said : Hitherto thou shalt come, and shalt go no further, and here thou shalt break thy swelling waves."
Job,38,12,"Didst thou since thy birth command the morning, and shew the dawning of the day its place?"
Job,38,13,"And didst thou hold the extremities of the earth shaking them, and hast thou shaken the ungodly out of it?"
Job,38,14,"The seal shall be restored as clay, and shall stand as a garment :"
Job,38,15,"From the wicked their light shall be taken away, and the high arm shall be broken."
Job,38,16,"Hast thou entered into the depths of the sea, and walked in the lowest parts of the deep?"
Job,38,17,"Have the gates of death been opened to thee, and hast thou seen the darksome doors?"
Job,38,18,"Hast thou considered the breadth of the earth? tell me, if thou knowest all things?"
Job,38,19,"Where is the way where light dwelleth, and where is the place of darkness :"
Job,38,20,"That thou mayst bring every thing to its own bounds, and understand the paths of the house thereof."
Job,38,21,Didst thou know then that thou shouldst be born ? and didst thou know the number of thy days?
Job,38,22,"Hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow, or has thou beheld the treasures of the hail :"
Job,38,23,"Which I have prepared for the time of the enemy, against the day of battle and war?"
Job,38,24,"By what way is the light spread, and heat divided upon the earth?"
Job,38,25,"Who gave a course to violent showers, or a way for noisy thunder :"
Job,38,26,"That it should rain on the earth without man in the wilderness, where no mortal dwelleth :"
Job,38,27,"That it should fill the desert and desolate land, and should bring forth green grass?"

Daniel,1,11,"And Daniel said to Malasar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel,"
Daniel,1,12,"Try, I beseech thee, thy servants for ten days, and let pulse be given"
Daniel,1,13,"And look upon our faces, and the faces of the children that eat of the king’s meat: and as thou shalt see, deal with thy servants."
Daniel,1,14,"And when he had heard these words, he tried them for ten days."

Daniel,2,11,"For the thing that thou askest, O king, is difficult; nor can any one be found that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose conversation is not with men."
Daniel,2,12,"Upon hearing this, the king in fury, and in great wrath, commanded that all the wise men of Babylon"
Daniel,2,13,"And the decree being gone forth, the wise men were slain: and Daniel and his companions were sought for, to be put to death. The Dream Revealed to Daniel"
Daniel,2,14,"Then Daniel inquired concerning the law and the sentence, of Arioch the general of the king’s army,"
Daniel,2,15,"And he asked him that had received the orders of the king, why so cruel a sentence was gone forth from the face of the king. And when Arioch had"
Daniel,2,16,"Daniel went in and desired of the king, that he would give him time to resolve the question and declare it to the king."
Daniel,2,17,"And he went into his house, and told the matter to Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias his companions:"
Daniel,2,18,"To the end that they should ask mercy at the face of the God of heaven concerning this secret, and that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,19,"Then was the mystery revealed to Daniel by a vision in the night: and Daniel blessed the God of heaven,"
Daniel,2,20,And speaking he said: Blessed be the name of the Lord from eternity and for evermore: for wisdom and fortitude are his.
Daniel,2,21,"And he changeth times and ages: taketh away kingdoms and establisheth them, giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding."
Daniel,2,22,"He revealeth deep and hidden things, and knoweth what is in darkness: and light is with him."
Daniel,2,23,"To thee, O God of our fathers, I give thanks, and I praise thee: because thou hast given me wisdom and strength: and now thou hast shewn me what we desired of thee, for thou hast made known to us, the king’s discourse. Daniel Interprets the Dream"
Daniel,2,24,"After this Daniel went in to Arioch, to whom the king had given orders to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and he spoke thus to him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will tell the solution to the king."
Daniel,2,25,"Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel to the king, and said to him: I have found a man of the"
Daniel,2,26,"The king answered, and said to Daniel, whose name was Baltassar: Thinkest thou indeed that thou canst tell me the dream that"

Daniel,2,28,"But there is a God in heaven that revealeth mysteries, who hath shewn to thee, O king Nabuchodonosor, what is to come to pass in the latter times. Thy dream, and"
Daniel,2,29,"Thou, O king, didst begin to think in thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth mysteries shewed thee what shall come to pass."
Daniel,2,30,"To me also this secret is revealed, not by any wisdom that I have more than all men alive: but that the interpretation might be made manifest to the king, and thou mightest know the thoughts of thy mind."
Daniel,2,31,"Thou, O king, sawest, and behold there was as it were a great statue: this statue, which was great"
Daniel,2,32,The head of this statue
Daniel,2,33,And
Daniel,2,34,"Thus thou sawest, till a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands: and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron and of clay,"
Daniel,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of a summer’s thrashingfloor, and they were carried away by the wind: and there was no place found for them: but the stone that struck the statue, became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,"This is the dream: we will also tell the interpretation thereof before thee, O king."
Daniel,2,37,Thou art a king
Daniel,2,38,"And all places wherein the children of men, and the beasts of the field do dwell: he hath also given the birds of the air into thy hand, and hath put all things under thy power: thou therefore art the head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"And after thee shall rise up another kingdom, inferior to thee, of silver: and another third kingdom of brass, which shall rule over all the world."
Daniel,2,40,"And the fourth kingdom shall be as iron. As iron breaketh into pieces, and subdueth all things, so"
Daniel,2,41,"Arid whereas thou sawest the feet, and the toes, part of potter’s clay, and part of iron: the kingdom shall be divided, but yet it shall take its origin from the iron,"
Daniel,2,42,And as the toes of the feet were part of
Daniel,2,43,"And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall be mingled indeed together with the seed of man, but they shall not stick fast one to another, as iron cannot be mixed with clay."
Daniel,2,44,"But in the days of those kingdoms the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, and his kingdom shall not be delivered up to another people, and it shall break in pieces,"
Daniel,2,45,"According as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and broke in pieces, the clay, and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the gold, the great God hath shewn the king what shall come to pass hereafter, and the dream is true, and the interpretation thereof is faithful. Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel"
Daniel,2,46,"Then king Nabuchodonosor fell on his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should"

Daniel,2,48,"Then the king advanced Daniel to a high station, and gave him many and great gifts: and he made him governor over all the provinces of Babylon, and chief of the magistrates over all the wise"
Daniel,2,49,"And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago over the works of the province of Babylon: but Daniel himself was in the king’s palace."
Daniel,3,1,"King Nabuchodonosor made a statue of gold, of sixty cubits high, and six cubits broad, and he set it"
Daniel,3,2,"Then Nabuchodonosor the king sent to call together the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the captains, the rulers, and governors, and all the chief men of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up."
Daniel,3,3,"Then the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the captains, and rulers, and the great men that were placed in authority, and all the princes of the provinces, were gathered together to come to the dedication of the statue, which king Nabuchodonosor had set up. And they stood before the statue"
Daniel,3,4,Then a herald cried with a strong voice: To you it is

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Accused"
Daniel,3,8,"And presently at that very time some Chaldeans came and accused the Jews,"
Daniel,3,9,And said to king

Daniel,3,13,"Then Nabuchodonosor in fury, and in wrath, commanded that Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago should"
Daniel,3,14,"And Nabuchodonosor the king spoke to them, and said: Is it true, O Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, that you do not worship my gods, nor"
Daniel,3,15,"Now therefore if you be ready at what hour soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, harp, sackbut, and psaltery, and symphony, and of all kind of music, prostrate yourselves, and adore the statue which I have made: but if you do not adore, you shall be cast the same hour into the furnace of burning fire: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand?"
Daniel,3,16,"Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago answered and said to king Nabuchodonosor: We have no occasion"
Daniel,3,17,"For behold our God, whom we worship, is able to save us"
Daniel,3,18,"But if he will not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not worship thy gods, nor adore the golden statue which thou hast set up. The Fiery Furnace"
Daniel,3,19,"Then was Nabuchodonosor filled with fury: and the countenance of his face was changed against Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times"
Daniel,3,20,"And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army, to bind the feet of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the furnace of"
Daniel,3,21,"And immediately these men were bound and were cast into the furnace of burning fire,"
Daniel,3,22,"For the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace was heated exceedingly. And the flame of the fire slew those men that"
Daniel,3,23,"But these three men, that is, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, fell down bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire."
Daniel,3,24,"Then Nabuchodonosor the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and said to his nobles: Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered the king, and said: True, O king."
Daniel,3,25,"He answered, and said: Behold I see four men loose, and walking in the midst of the fire, and there"
Daniel,3,26,"Then Nabuchodonosor came to the door of the burning fiery furnace, and said: Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, ye servants of the most high God, go ye forth, and come. And immediately Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago went out from"
Daniel,3,27,"And the nobles, and the magistrates, and the judges, and the great men of the king being gathered together, considered these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies, and that not a hair of their head had been singed, nor their garments altered, nor the smell of the fire had passed on them."
Daniel,3,28,"Then Nabuchodonosor breaking forth, said: Blessed be the God of them, to wit, of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that believed in him: and they changed the king’s word, and delivered up their bodies that they might not serve, nor adore any god,"
Daniel,3,29,"By me therefore this decree is made, that every people, tribe, and tongue, which shall speak blasphemy against the God of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, shall be destroyed,"
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king promoted Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,4,1,"Nabuchodonosor the king, to all peoples, nations, and tongues, that dwell in all the earth, peace be"
Daniel,4,2,The most high God hath wrought signs and wonders toward me. It hath seemed good to me therefore to publish

Daniel,4,4,"I Nabuchodonosor was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:"
Daniel,4,5,I saw a dream that
Daniel,4,6,"Then I set forth a decree, that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought in before me, and that they should shew"
Daniel,4,7,"Then came in the diviners, the wise men, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers, and I told the dream before them: but they did not shew me the interpretation thereof:"
Daniel,4,8,"Till their colleague Daniel came in before me, whose name is Baltassar, according to the name of my"
Daniel,4,9,"Baltassar, prince of the diviners, because I know that thou hast in thee the spirit of the holy gods, and that no secret is impossible to thee: tell me the visions of my dreams that I have seen, and the interpretation of them."
Daniel,4,10,"This was the vision of my head in my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was exceeding great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree was great, and strong: and the height thereof reached unto heaven: the sight thereof was even to the ends of all the earth."
Daniel,4,12,"Its leaves were most beautiful, and its fruit exceeding much: and in it was food for all: under it dwelt cattle, and beasts, and in the branches thereof the fowls of the air had their abode: and all flesh did eat of it."
Daniel,4,13,"I saw in the vision of my head upon my bed, and behold a watcher, and a holy one came down from heaven."
Daniel,4,14,"He cried aloud, and said thus: Cut down the tree, and chop off the branches thereof: shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruits: let the beasts fly away that are under it, and the birds from its branches."
Daniel,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and let it be tied with a band of iron, and of brass, among the grass, that is without, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the wild beasts in the grass of the earth."
Daniel,4,16,"Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given him; and let seven times pass over him."
Daniel,4,17,"This is the decree by the sentence of the watchers, and the word And demand of the holy ones; till the living know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men; and he will give it to whomsoever it shall please him, and he will appoint the basest man over it."
Daniel,4,18,"I king Nabuchodonosor saw this dream: thou, therefore, O Baltassar, tell me quickly the interpretation: for all the wise men of my kingdom axe not able to declare the meaning of it to me: but thou art able, because the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. Daniel Interprets the Second Dream"
Daniel,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name was Baltassar, began silently to think within himself for about one hour: and his thoughts troubled him. But the king answering, said: Baltassar, let not the dream and the interpretation thereof trouble thee. Baltassar answered, and said: My lord, the dream be to them that"

Daniel,4,23,"And whereas the king saw a watcher, and a holy one come down from heaven, and say: Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, and let it be bound with iron and brass among the grass without, and let it be sprinkled with the dew of heaven, and let his feeding be with the wild beasts, till seven times pass"
Daniel,4,24,"This is the interpretation of the sentence of the most High, which is come upon my lord"
Daniel,4,25,"They shall cast thee out from among men, and thy dwelling shall be with cattle and with wild beasts, and thou shalt eat grass as an ox, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven: and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and"
Daniel,4,26,"But whereas he commanded, that the stump of the roots thereof, that is, of the tree, should be left: thy kingdom shall remain to thee after thou shalt have known that"
Daniel,4,27,"Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and redeem thou thy sins with alms, and thy iniquities with works of mercy to the poor: perhaps he will forgive thy offences. The Second Dream Fulfilled"
Daniel,4,28,All these things came upon king Nabuchodonosor.
Daniel,4,29,At the end of twelve months he was walking in
Daniel,4,30,"And the king answered, and said: Is not this the great Babylon, which I have built to be the seat of the kingdom, by the strength of my power, and in the glory of my excellence?"
Daniel,4,31,"And while the word was yet in the king’s mouth, a voice came down from heaven: To thee, O king"
Daniel,4,32,"And they shall cast thee out from among men, and thy dwelling shall be with cattle and wild beasts: thou shalt eat grass like an ox, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and"
Daniel,4,33,"The same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nabuchodonosor, and he was driven away from among men, and did eat grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven: till his hairs grew like the feathers of eagles, and his nails like birds’ claws. Nebuchadnezzar Restored"
Daniel,4,34,"Now at the end of the days, I Nabuchodonosor lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my sense was restored to me: and I blessed the most High, and I praised and glorified him that liveth for ever: for his power is an everlasting power, and his kingdom is to all generations."
Daniel,4,35,"And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing before him: for he doth according to his will, as well with the powers of heaven, as among the inhabitants of the earth: and there is none that can resist his hand, and say to him: Why hast thou done it?"
Daniel,4,36,"At the same time my sense returned to me, and I came to the honour and glory of my kingdom: and my shape returned to me: and my nobles, and my magistrates sought for me, and I was restored to"
Daniel,4,37,"Therefore I Nabuchodonosor do now praise, and magnify, and glorify the King of heaven: because all his works are true, and his ways judgments, and them that walk in pride he is able to abase."
Daniel,5,1,Baltasar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his nobles: and every one drank according to
Daniel,5,2,"And being now drunk he commanded that they should bring the vessels of gold and silver which Nabuchodonosor his father had brought away out of the temple, that was in Jerusalem, that the"
Daniel,5,3,"Then were the golden and silver vessels brought, which he had brought away out of the temple that was in Jerusalem: and"
Daniel,5,4,"They drank wine, and praised their gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, and of wood, and of stone. The Handwriting on the Wall"
Daniel,5,5,"In the same hour there appeared fingers, as it were of the hand of a man, writing over against the candlestick upon the surface of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king beheld the joints of the hand"
Daniel,5,6,"Then was the king’s countenance changed, and his thoughts troubled him: and the joints"
Daniel,5,7,"And the king cried out aloud to bring in the wise men, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spoke, and said to the wise men of Babylon: Whosoever shall read this writing, and shall make known to me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and shall have a golden chain on his neck, and shall be the third"
Daniel,5,8,"Then came in all the king’s wise men, but they could neither read the writing,"
Daniel,5,9,"Wherewith king Baltasar was much troubled, and his countenance was changed: and his nobles also were troubled."
Daniel,5,10,"Then the queen, on occasion of what had happened to the king, and his nobles, came into the banquet house: and she spoke and said: O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, neither"
Daniel,5,11,"There is a man in thy kingdom that hath the spirit of the holy gods in him: and in the days of thy father knowledge and wisdom were found in him: for king Nabuchodonosor thy father appointed him prince of the wise men, enchanters, Chaldeans, and"
Daniel,5,12,"Because a greater spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, and interpretation of dreams, and shewing of secrets, and resolving of difficult things, were found in him, that is, in Daniel: whom the king named Baltarsar. Now therefore let Daniel be called for, and he will tell the interpretation. Daniel Interprets the Handwriting"
Daniel,5,13,"Then Daniel was brought in before the king. And the king spoke, and said to him: Art thou Daniel of"
Daniel,5,14,"I have heard of thee, that thou hast the spirit of the gods, and excellent knowledge, and understanding, and wisdom"
Daniel,5,15,"And now the wise men the magicians have come in before me, to read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof: and they could not declare to me the meaning of this writing."
Daniel,5,16,"But I have heard of thee, that thou canst interpret obscure things, and resolve difficult things: now if thou art able to read the writing, and to shew me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and shalt have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third prince in my kingdom."
Daniel,5,17,"To which Daniel made answer, and said before the king: Thy rewards be to thyself, and the gifts of thy house give to another: but the writing I will read to thee, O king, and shew thee the interpretation"
Daniel,5,18,"O king, the most high God gave to Nabuchodonosor thy father a kingdom, and greatness,"
Daniel,5,19,"And for the greatness that he gave to him, all people, tribes, and languages trembled, and were afraid of him: whom he would, he slew: and whom he would, he destroyed: and"
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit hardened unto pride, he was put down from the throne of his kingdom, and his glory"
Daniel,5,21,"And he was driven out from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses, and he did eat grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven: till he knew that the most High ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he will"
Daniel,5,22,"Thou also his son, O Baltasar, hast not humbled thy heart,"
Daniel,5,23,"But hast lifted thyself up against the Lord of heaven: and the vessels of his house have been brought before thee: and thou, and thy nobles, and thy wives, and thy concubines have drunk wine in them: and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and of gold, and of brass, of iron, and of wood, and of stone, that neither see, nor hear, nor feel: but the God who hath"
Daniel,5,24,Wherefore he hath sent the part of the hand which hath written this that is set down.
Daniel,5,25,"And this is the writing that is written: MANE, THECEL, PHARES."
Daniel,5,26,And this is the interpretation of
Daniel,5,27,THECEL: thou art weighed
Daniel,5,28,"PHARES: thy kingdom is divided, and is given to the Medes and Persians."
Daniel,5,29,"Then by the king’s command Daniel was clothed with purple, and a chain of gold was put about his neck: and it was proclaimed of him that he had power as the third man in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,The same night Baltasar the Chaldean king was slain.
Daniel,5,31,"And Darius the Mede succeeded to the kingdom, being threescore and two years old."
Daniel,6,1,"It seemed good to Darius, and he appointed over the kingdom a hundred and twenty governors to be"
Daniel,6,2,"And three princes over them, of whom Daniel was one: that the governors"
Daniel,6,3,"And Daniel excelled all the princes,"
Daniel,6,4,"And the king thought to set him over all the kingdom: whereupon the princes, and the governors sought to find occasion against Daniel with regard to the king: and they could find no cause, nor suspicion, because he was faithful, and no fault,"
Daniel,6,5,"Then these men said: We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, unless perhaps concerning the law of his God."
Daniel,6,6,"Then the princes, and the governors craftily suggested to the king, and spoke thus unto him: King"
Daniel,6,7,"All the princes of the kingdom, the magistrates, and governors, the senators, and judges have consulted together, that an imperial decree, and an edict be published: That whosoever shall ask any petition of any god, or man, for thirty days, but of thee, O king, shall be cast"

Daniel,6,11,Wherefore those

And the king answered them, saying: The word is true according to the decree of"
Daniel,6,13,"Then they answered, and said before the king: Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Juda, hath not regarded thy law, nor the decree that thou hast made: but three times a day he maketh his prayer."
Daniel,6,14,"Now when the king had heard these words, he was very much grieved, and in behalf of Daniel he"
Daniel,6,15,"But those mer. perceiving the king’s design, said to him: Know thou, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no decree which the king hath made, may be altered."
Daniel,6,16,"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of the lions. And the"

Daniel,6,18,"And the king went away to his house and laid himself down without taking supper, and meat was not set before him, and even sleep departed from him."
Daniel,6,19,"Then the king rising very early in the morning, went in haste to the lions’ den:"
Daniel,6,20,"And coming near to the den, cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel, and said to him: Daniel, servant of the living God, hath thy God, whom thou servest always, been able, thinkest thou, to deliver thee from the lions?"
Daniel,6,21,"And Daniel answering the king, said: O king, live for ever:"
Daniel,6,22,"My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut up the mouths of the lions, and they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him justice hath"
Daniel,6,23,"Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and he commanded that Daniel should be taken out of the den: and Daniel was taken out of the den, and no hurt was found in him, because he believed in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"And by the king’s commandment, those men were brought that bad accused Daniel: and they were cast into the lions’ den, they and their children, and their wives: and they did not reach the bottom of the den, before the lions caught them, and broke all their bones in pieces. Darius Honors God"
Daniel,6,25,"Then king Darius wrote to all people, tribes, and languages, dwelling in the whole earth: PEACE be multiplied unto you."
Daniel,6,26,"It is decreed by me, that in all my empire and my kingdom all men dread and fear the God of Daniel. For he is the living and eternal God for ever: and his kingdom shall not be destroyed, and his power shall be for ever."
Daniel,6,27,"He is the deliverer, and saviour, doing signs and wonders in heaven, and in earth: who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions’ den."
Daniel,6,28,"Now Daniel continued unto the reign of Darius, and the reign of Cyrus the Persian."
Daniel,7,1,"In the first year of Baltasar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream: and the vision of his head was upon his bed: and writing the dream, he comprehended it in few words: and relating the sum of it in short,"
Daniel,7,2,"I saw in my vision by night, and behold the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great"
Daniel,7,3,"And four great beasts, different one from another, came up out of the sea."
Daniel,7,4,"The first was like a lioness, and had the wings of an eagle: I beheld till her wings were plucked off, and she was lifted up"
Daniel,7,5,"And behold another beast like a bear stood up on one side: and there were three rows in the mouth thereof,"
Daniel,7,6,"After this I beheld, and lo, another like a leopard, and it had upon it four wings as of a fowl, and the beast had four heads,"
Daniel,7,7,"After this I beheld in the vision of the night, and lo, a fourth beast, terrible and wonderful, and exceeding strong, it had great iron teeth, eating and breaking in pieces, and treading down the rest with its feet: and it was unlike to the other beasts which I had seen before it,"
Daniel,7,8,"I considered the horns, and behold another little horn sprung out of the midst of them: and three of the first horns were plucked up at the presence thereof: and behold eyes like the eyes of a man were in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things. Daniel’s Vision of the Ancient of Days"
Daniel,7,9,"I beheld till thrones were placed, and the Ancient of days sat: his garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like clean wool: his throne like flames of fire: the wheels of it like a burning fire."
Daniel,7,10,"A swift stream of fire issued forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood before him: the judgment sat, and the books were opened."
Daniel,7,11,I beheld because of the voice of the great words which that horn spoke: and I saw that the beast
Daniel,7,12,"And that the power of the other beasts was taken away: and that times of life were appointed them for a time, and time. Daniel’s Vision of the Son of Man"
Daniel,7,13,"I beheld therefore in the vision of the night, and lo, one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and he came even to the Ancient of days: and they presented him before him."
Daniel,7,14,"And he gave him power, and glory, and a kingdom: and all peoples, tribes and tongues shall serve him: his power is an everlasting power that shall not be taken away: and his kingdom that shall not be destroyed. Daniel’s Visions Interpreted"
Daniel,7,15,"My spirit trembled, I Daniel was affrighted at these things, and the visions of my head troubled me."
Daniel,7,16,"I went near to one of them that stood by, and asked the truth of him concerning all these things,"
Daniel,7,17,These four great beasts are four

Daniel,7,21,"I beheld, and lo, that horn made war against"
Daniel,7,22,"Till the Ancient of days came and gave judgment to the saints of the most High, and the time came, and the saints obtained the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"And thus he said: The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be greater than all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces."
Daniel,7,24,"And the ten horns of the same kingdom, shall be ten kings: and another shall rise up after them, and"

Daniel,7,27,"And that the kingdom, and power, and the greatness of the kingdom, under the whole heaven, may be given to the people of the saints of the most High: whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all kings shall serve him, and shall obey him."
Daniel,7,28,"Hitherto is the end of the word. I Daniel was much troubled with my thoughts, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the word in my heart."
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of king Baltasar, a vision appeared to me. I Daniel, after what I had seen"
Daniel,8,2,"Saw in my vision when I was in the castle of Susa, which is in the province of Elam:"
Daniel,8,3,"And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold a ram stood before the water, having two high horns, and one higher than the other, and growing up."
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west, and against the north, and against the south: and no beasts could withstand him, nor be delivered out of his hand: and he did according to his own will, and became great."
Daniel,8,5,"And I understood: and behold a he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and he"

Daniel,8,8,"And the he goat became exceeding great: and when he was grown, the great horn was broken, and there came up four horns under it towards the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,"And out of one of them came forth a little horn: and it became great against the south, and against"
Daniel,8,10,And it was magnified even unto the strength of heaven: and it

Daniel,8,12,"And strength was given him against the continual sacrifice, because of sins: and truth"
Daniel,8,13,"And I heard one of the saints speaking, and one saint said to another, I know not to whom that was speaking: How long shall be the vision, concerning the continual sacrifice, and the sin of the desolation that is made: and the sanctuary,"
Daniel,8,14,And he said to him: Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days: and the sanctuary shall be cleansed. Gabriel Interprets Daniel’s Vision
Daniel,8,15,"And it came to pass when I Daniel saw the vision, and sought the meaning, that behold there stood"
Daniel,8,16,And I heard the voice of a man between Ulai: and

Daniel,8,18,"And when he spoke to me I fell flat on the ground: and he touched me, and set me upright,"
Daniel,8,19,And he said to me: I will shew thee what things are to come to pass in the end of the malediction: for the time hath its end.

Daniel,8,23,"And after their reign, when iniquities shall be grown up, there shall arise a king of a shameless face, and understanding dark sentences."
Daniel,8,24,"And his power shall be strengthened, but not by his own force: and he shall lay all things waste, and shall prosper, and do more than can be believed. And he shall destroy the mighty, and the people of the saints,"
Daniel,8,25,"According to his will, and craft shall be successful in his hand: and his heart shall be puffed up, and in the abundance of all things he shall kill many: and he shall rise up against the prince of princes, and shall be broken without hand."
Daniel,8,26,"And the vision of the evening and the morning, which was told, is true: thou therefore seal up the vision, because it shall come to pass after many days."

Daniel,11,6,"And after the end of years they shall be in league together: and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make friendship, but she shall not obtain the strength of the arm, neither shall her seed stand: and she shall be given up, and her young men that brought her, and they that strengthened her in these"

Daniel,11,8,"And he shall also carry away captive into Egypt their gods, and their graven things, and their precious vessels"
Daniel,11,9,"And the king of the south shall enter into the kingdom, and shall return to his own land."
Daniel,11,10,"And his sons shall be provoked, and they shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and he shall come with haste like a flood: and he shall return and be stirred up, and he shall join battle with his"
Daniel,11,11,"And the king of the south being provoked shall go forth, and shall fight against the king of the north, and shall prepare an exceeding great multitude, and a multitude shall be given into his hand."
Daniel,11,12,"And he shall take a multitude, and his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall cast down many"
Daniel,11,13,"For the king of the north shall return and shall prepare a multitude much greater than before: and in the end of times and years, be shall come in haste with a great army, and much riches."
Daniel,11,14,"And in those times many shall rise up against the king of the south, and the children of prevaricators"
Daniel,11,15,"And the king of the north shall come, and shall cast up a mount, and shall take the best fenced cities: and the arms of the south"
Daniel,11,16,"And he shall come upon him and do according to his pleasure, and there shall be none to stand against his"
Daniel,11,17,"And he shall set his face to come to possess all his kingdom, and he shall make upright conditions with him: and he shall give him a daughter of women, to overthrow it: and she shall not stand, neither shall she be for"
Daniel,11,18,"And he shall turn his face to the islands, and shall take many: and he shall cause the prince of"
Daniel,11,19,"And he shall turn his face to the empire of his own land, and he shall stumble, and fall, and shall not be found."
Daniel,11,20,"And there shall stand up in his place, one most vile, and unworthy of kingly honour: and in a few"
Daniel,11,21,"And there shall stand up in his place one despised, and the kingly honour shall not be given him: and he shall come privately, and shall obtain"
Daniel,11,22,"And the arms of the fighter shall be overcome before his face, and shall be"
Daniel,11,23,"And after friendships, he will deal deceitfully with him:"
Daniel,11,24,"And he shall enter into rich and plentiful cities: and he shall do that which his fathers never did, nor his fathers’ fathers: he shall scatter their spoils, and their prey, and their riches, and shall forecast devices against the best fenced places: and"
Daniel,11,25,And his strength and his heart shall be stirred up against the king of the south with a great army: and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with many and very strong succours:
Daniel,11,26,"And they that eat bread with him,"
Daniel,11,27,"And the heart of the two kings shall be to do evil, and they shall speak lies at one table, and they shall not prosper:"
Daniel,11,28,"And he shall return into his land with much riches: and his heart shall be against the holy covenant, and he shall succeed and shall return into his own land."
Daniel,11,29,"At the time appointed he shall return, and he shall come to the south, but the latter time shall not be like the former."
Daniel,11,30,"And the galleys and the Romans shall come upon him, and he shall be struck, and shall return, and shall have indignation against the covenant of the sanctuary, and he shall succeed: and he shall return"
Daniel,11,31,"And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall defile the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the continual"
Daniel,11,32,And such as deal wickedly against the covenant shall deceitfully dissemble: but the people that know their God shall prevail and

Daniel,11,34,And when they shall have fallen
Daniel,11,35,"And some of the learned shall fall, that they may be tried, and may be chosen, and made white even to the appointed time, because yet there shall be another time. The King Who Exalts Himself"
Daniel,11,36,"And the king shall do according to his will, and he shall be lifted up, and shall magnify himself against every god: and he shall speak great things against the God of gods, and shall prosper, till the wrath"
Daniel,11,37,"And he shall make no account of the God of his fathers: and he shall follow the lust of women, and he shall not regard any gods: for he shall rise up"
Daniel,11,38,But he shall worship the god Maozim in his place: and a god whom his fathers
Daniel,11,39,"And he shall do this to fortify Maozim with a strange god, whom he hath acknowledged, and he shall increase glory and shall give them power over many, and shall divide the land gratis."
Daniel,11,40,"And at the time prefixed the king of the south shall fight against him, and the king of the north shall come against him like a tempest, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with a great navy, and he"
Daniel,11,41,"And he shall enter into the glorious land, and many shall fall: and these only shall be saved out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the"
Daniel,11,42,And he shall lay his hand upon the lands: and the land of Egypt
Daniel,11,43,"And he shall have power over the treasures of gold, and of silver, and all the"
Daniel,11,44,"And tidings out of the east, and out of the north shall trouble him: and he shall come with a great multitude to destroy and slay"
Daniel,11,45,"And he shall fix his tabernacle Apadno between the seas, upon a glorious and holy mountain: and he shall come even to the top thereof, and none shall help him."
Daniel,12,1,"But at that time shall Michael rise up, the great prince, who standeth for the children of thy people: and a time shall come such as never was from the time that nations began even until that time. And"
Daniel,12,2,"And many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth, shall awake: some unto life everlasting, and others unto"
Daniel,12,3,But they that are learned shall shine as the brightness of the firmament:
Daniel,12,4,"But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time appointed: many shall pass over, and knowledge shall be manifold."
Daniel,12,5,"And I Daniel looked, and behold as it were two others stood: one on this side upon the bank of the"
Daniel,12,6,"And I said to the man that was clothed In linen, that stood upon the waters of the river: How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?"
Daniel,12,7,"And I heard the man that was clothed in linen, that stood upon the waters of the river: when he had lifted up his right hand, and his left hand to heaven, and had sworn, by him that liveth for ever, that it should be unto a time, and times, and half a time. And when the scattering of the band of the holy"

Daniel,12,9,"And he said: Go, Daniel, because the words are"

Daniel,12,11,"And from the time when the continual sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination unto desolation shall be set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred ninety days,"
Daniel,12,12,Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh unto a thousand three hundred thirty-five days.
Daniel,12,13,"But go thou thy ways until the time appointed: and thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot unto the end of the days."
Hosea,1,1,"The word of the Lord, that came to Osee the son of Beeri, in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias kings of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joas king of Israel."
Hosea,1,2,"The beginning of the Lord’s speaking by Osse: and the Lord said to Osee: Go, take thee a wife of fornications, and have of her children of fornications: for the land by fornication shall depart from the"
Hosea,1,3,"So he went, and took Gomer the daughter of Debelaim: and she conceived and bore him a son."
Hosea,1,4,"And the Lord said to him: Call his name Jezrahel: for yet a little while, and I will visit the blood of"
Hosea,1,5,And in that day I will break in pieces the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrahel.
Hosea,1,6,"And she conceived again, and bore a daughter, and he said to him: Call her name, Without mercy:"
Hosea,1,7,"And I will have mercy on the house of Juda, and I will save them by the Lord their God: and Iwill not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen."
Hosea,1,8,"And she weaned her that was called Without mercy. And she conceived, and bore a son."
Hosea,1,9,"And he said: Call his name, Not my people: for you are not my people, and I will not be yours."
Hosea,1,10,"And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, that is without measure, and shall not be numbered. And it shall be in the place where it shall be said to them: You are not my people: it shall be said to them: Ye are the sons of the living God."
Hosea,1,11,"And the children of Juda, and the children of Israel shall be gathered together: and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall come up out of the land: for great is the day of Jezrahel."
Hosea,2,1,"Say ye to your brethren: You are my people, and to your sister: Thou hast obtained mercy."
Hosea,2,2,"Judge your mother, judge her: because she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her put away her fornications from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts."
Hosea,2,3,"Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born: and I will make her as a wilderness, and will set her as a land that none can pass through, and will kill her with drought."
Hosea,2,4,And I will not have mercy on her children: for they are the children of fornications.
Hosea,2,5,"For their mother hath committed fornication, she that conceived them is covered with shame: for she said: I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread, and my water, my wool, and my flax, my oil, and my drink."
Hosea,2,6,"Wherefore behold I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will stop it up with a wall, and she shall not find her paths."
Hosea,2,7,"And she shall follow after her lovers, and shall not overtake them: and she shall seek them, and shall not find, and she shall say: I will go, and return to my first husband, because it was better with me then, than now."
Hosea,2,8,"And she did not know that I gave her corn and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver, and gold, which they have used in the service of Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in its season, and I will set at liberty my wool, and my flax, which covered her disgrace."
Hosea,2,10,And now I will lay open her folly in the eyes of her lovers: and no man shall deliver her out of my hand:
Hosea,2,11,"And I will cause all her mirth to cease, her solemnities, her new moons, her sabbaths, and all her festival times."
Hosea,2,12,"And I will destroy her vines, and her fig trees, of which she said: These are my rewards, which my lovers have given me: and I will make her as a forest, and the beasts of the field shall devour her."
Hosea,2,13,"And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, to whom she burnt incense, and decked herself out with her earrings, and with her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith the Lord. God’s Mercy to Israel"
Hosea,2,14,"Therefore, behold I will allure her, and will lead her into the wilderness: and I will speak to her heart."
Hosea,2,15,"And I will give her vinedressers out of the same place, and the valley of Achor for an opening of hope: and she shall sing there according to the days of her youth, and according to the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"And it shall be in that day, saith the Lord, That she shall call me : My husband, and she shall call me no more Baali."
Hosea,2,17,"And I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and she shall no more remember their name."
Hosea,2,18,"And in that day I will make a covenant with them, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the air, and with the creeping things of the earth: and I will destroy the bow, and the sword, and war out of the land: and I will make them sleep secure."
Hosea,2,19,"And I will espouse thee to me for ever: and I will espouse thee to me in justice, and judgment, and in mercy, and in commiserations."
Hosea,2,20,And I will espouse thee to me in faith: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
Hosea,2,21,"And it shall come to pass in that day: I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth."
Hosea,2,22,"And the earth shall hear the core, and the wine, and the oil, and these shall hear Jezrahel."
Hosea,2,23,"And I will sow her unto me in the earth, and I will have mercy on her that was without mercy. And I will say to that which was not my people: Thou art my people: and they shall say: Thou art my God."
Hosea,3,1,"And the Lord said to me: Go yet again, and love a woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress : as the Lord loveth the children of Israel, and they look to strange gods, and love the husks of the"
Hosea,3,2,"And I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a core of barley, and for half a core"
Hosea,3,3,"And I said to her: Thou shalt wait for me many days: thou shalt not play the harlot, and"
Hosea,3,4,"For the children of Israel shall sit many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without altar, and without ephod, and"
Hosea,3,5,"And after this the children of Israel shall return, and shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king: and they shall fear the Lord, and his goodness in the last days."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel, for the Lord shall enter into judgment with the inhabitants of the land: for there is no truth, and there is no mercy, and there is no knowledge of God in the land."
Hosea,4,2,"Cursing, and lying, and killing, and theft, and adultery have overflowed, and blood hath touched blood."
Hosea,4,3,"Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it shall languish with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the air: yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be gathered together."
Hosea,4,4,But yet let not any man judge: and let not a man be rebuked: for thy people are as they that contradict the priest.
Hosea,4,5,"And thou shalt fall to day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee: in the night I have made thy mother to be silent."
Hosea,4,6,"My people have been silent, because they had no knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will reject thee, that thou shalt not do the office of priesthood to me: and thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children."
Hosea,4,7,According to the multitude of them so have they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.
Hosea,4,8,"They shall eat the sins of my people, and shall lift up their souls to their iniquity."
Hosea,4,9,"And there shall be like people like priest: and I will visit their ways upon them, and I will repay them their devices."
Hosea,4,10,"And they shall eat and shall not be filled: they have committed fornication, and have not ceased: because they have forsaken the Lord in not observing his law."
Hosea,4,11,"Fornication, and wine, and drunkenness take away the understanding."
Hosea,4,12,"My people have consulted their stocks, and their staff hath declared unto them: for the spirit of fornication hath deceived them, and they have committed fornication against their God."
Hosea,4,13,"They offered sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burnt incense upon the hills: under the oak, and the poplar, and the turpentine tree, because the shadow thereof was good: therefore shall your daughters commit fornication, and your spouses shall be adulteresses."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not visit upon your daughters when they shell commit fornication, and upon your spouses when they shall commit adultery: because themselves conversed with harlots, and offered sacrifice with the effeminate, and the people that doth not understand shall be beaten."
Hosea,4,15,"If thou play the harlot, O Israel, at least let not Juda offend: and go ye not into Galgal, and come not up into Bethaven, and do not swear: The Lord liveth."
Hosea,4,16,"For Israel hath gone astray like a wanton heifer: now will the Lord feed them, as a lamb in a spacious place."
Hosea,4,17,"Ephraim is a partaker with idols, let him alone."
Hosea,4,18,"Their banquet is separated, they have gone astray by fornication: they that should have protected them have loved to bring shame upon them."
Hosea,4,19,"The wind hath bound them up in its wings, and they shall be confounded because of their sacrifices."
Hosea,5,1,"Hear ye this, O priests, and hearken, O ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king: for there is a judgment against you, because you have been a snare to them whom you should have watched over, and a net spread upon Thabor."
Hosea,5,2,"And you have turned aside victims into the depth: and I am, the teacher of them all."
Hosea,5,3,"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now Ephraim hath committed fornication, Israel is defiled."
Hosea,5,4,"They will not set their thoughts to return to their God: for the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord."
Hosea,5,5,"And the pride of Israel shall answer in his face: and Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquity, Juda also shall fall with them."
Hosea,5,6,"With their flocks, and with their herds, they shall go to seek the Lord, and shall not find him: he is withdrawn from them."
Hosea,5,7,"They have transgressed against the Lord, for they have begotten children that are strangers: now shall a month devour them with their portions."
Hosea,5,8,"Blow ye the cornet in Gabaa, the trumpet in Rama: howl ye in Bethaven, behind thy back, O Benjamin."
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim shall be in desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel I have shewn that which shall surely be.
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Juda are become as they that take up the bound: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim is under oppression, and broken in judgment: because he began to go after filthiness."
Hosea,5,12,And I will be like a moth to Ephraim: and like rottenness to the house of Juda.
Hosea,5,13,"And Ephraim saw his sickness, and Juda his band: and Ephraim went to the Assyrian, and sent to the avenging king: and he shall not be able to heal you, neither shall he be able to take off the band from you."
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be like a lioness to Ephraim, and like a lion’s whelp to the house of Juda: I, I will catch, and go: I will take away, and there is none that can rescue."
Hosea,5,15,"I will go and return to my place: until you are consumed, and seek my face."
Hosea,6,1,"In their affliction they will rise early to me: Come, and let us return to the Lord:"
Hosea,6,2,"For he hath taken us, and he will heal us: he will strike, and he will cure us."
Hosea,6,3,"He will revive us after two days: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. We shall know, and we shall follow on, that we may know the Lord. His going forth is prepared as the morning light, and he will come to us as the early and the latter rain to the earth."
Hosea,6,4,"What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim? what shall I do to thee, O Juda? your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth away in the morning."
Hosea,6,5,"For this reason have I hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments shall go forth as the light."
Hosea,6,6,"For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice: and the knowledge of God more than holocausts."
Hosea,6,7,"But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant, there have they dealt treacherously against me."
Hosea,6,8,"Galaad is a city of workers of idols, supplanted with blood."
Hosea,6,9,"And like the jaws of highway robbers, they conspire with the priests who murder in the way those that pass out Sichem: for they have wrought wickedness."
Hosea,6,10,I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: the fornications of Ephraim there: Israel is defiled.
Hosea,6,11,"And thou also, O Juda, set thee a harvest, when I shall bring back captivity of my people."
Hosea,7,1,"When I would have healed Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria, for they have committed falsehood, and the thief is come in to steal, the robber is without."
Hosea,7,2,"And lest they may say in their hearts, that I remember all their wickedness: their own devices now have beset them about, they have been done before my face."
Hosea,7,3,They have made the king glad with their wickedness: and the princes with their lies.
Hosea,7,4,"They are all adulterers, like an oven heated by the baker: the city rested a little from the mingling of the leaven, till the whole was leavened."
Hosea,7,5,"The day of our king, the princes began to be mad with wine: he stretched out his hand with scorners."
Hosea,7,6,"Because they have applied their heart like an oven, when he laid snares for them: he slept all the night baking them, in the morning he himself was heated as a flaming fire."
Hosea,7,7,"They were all heated like an oven, and have devoured their judges : all their kings have fallen: there is none amongst them that calleth unto me."
Hosea,7,8,"Ephraim himself is mixed among the nations: Ephraim is become as bread baked under the ashes, that is not turned."
Hosea,7,9,"Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knew it not: yea, grey hairs also are spread about upon him, and he is ignorant of it."
Hosea,7,10,"And the pride of Israel shall be humbled before his face: and they have not returned to the Lord their God, nor have they sought him in all these."
Hosea,7,11,"And Ephraim is become as a dove that is decoyed, not having a heart: they called upon Egypt, they went to the Assyrians."
Hosea,7,12,"And when they shall go, I will spread my net upon them: I will bring them down as the fowl of the air, I will strike them as their congregation hath heard."
Hosea,7,13,"Woe to them, for they have departed from me: they shall be wasted because they have transgressed against me: and I redeemed them : and they have spoken lies against me."
Hosea,7,14,"And they have not cried to me with their heart, but they howled in their beds: they have thought upon wheat and wine, they are departed from me."
Hosea,7,15,"And I have chastised them, and strengthened their arms: and they have imagined evil against me."
Hosea,7,16,"They returned, that they might be without yoke: they became like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword, for the rage of their tongue. This is their derision in the land of Egypt."
Hosea,8,1,"Let there be a trumpet in thy throat like an eagle upon the house of the Lord: because they have transgressed my covenant, and have violated my law."
Hosea,8,2,"They shall call upon me: O my God, we, Israel, know thee."
Hosea,8,3,"Israel hath cast off the thing that is good, the enemy shall pursue him."
Hosea,8,4,"They have reigned, but not by me: they have been princes, and I knew not: of their silver, and their gold they have made idols to themselves, that they might perish."
Hosea,8,5,"Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off, my wrath is kindled against them. How long will they be incapable of being cleansed ?"
Hosea,8,6,"For itself also is the invention of Israel: a workman made it, and it is no god: for the calf of Samaria shall be turned to spiders’ webs."
Hosea,8,7,"For they shall sow wind, and reap a whirlwind, there is no standing stalk in it, the bud shall yield no meal; end if it should yield, strangers shall eat it."
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up: now is he become among the nations like an unclean vessel.
Hosea,8,9,"For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath given gifts to his lovers."
Hosea,8,10,"But even though they shall have hired the nations, now will I gather them together: and they shall rest a while from the burden of the king, and the princes."
Hosea,8,11,Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin: altars are become to him unto sin.
Hosea,8,12,"I shall write to him my manifold laws, which have been accounted as foreign."
Hosea,8,13,"They shall offer victims, they shall sacrifice flesh, and shall eat it, and the Lord will not receive them: now will he remember their iniquity, and will visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"And Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and hath built temples: and Juda hath built many fenced cities: and I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the houses thereof."
Hosea,9,1,"Rejoice not, O Israel: rejoice not as the nations do: for thou hast committed fornication against thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor."
Hosea,9,2,"The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the wine shall deceive them."
Hosea,9,3,"They shall not dwell in the Lord’s land: Ephraim is returned to Egypt, and hath eaten unclean things among the Assyrians."
Hosea,9,4,"They shall not offer wine to the Lord, neither shall they please him: their sacrifices shall be like the bread of mourners: all that shall eat it shall be defiled: for their bread is life for their soul, it shall not enter into the house of the Lord."
Hosea,9,5,"What will you do in the solemn day, in the day of the feast of the Lord?"
Hosea,9,6,"For behold they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them together, Memphis shall bury them: nettles shall inherit their beloved silver, the bur shall be in their tabernacles."
Hosea,9,7,"The days of visitation are come, the days of repaying are come: know ye, O Israel, that the prophet was foolish, the spiritual man was mad, for the multitude of thy iniquity, and the multitude of thy madness."
Hosea,9,8,"The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: the prophet is become a snare of ruin upon all his ways, madness is in the house of his God."
Hosea,9,9,"They have sinned deeply, as in the days of Gabaa: he will remember their iniquity, and will visit their sin."
Hosea,9,10,"I found Israel like grapes in the desert, I saw their fathers like the firstfruits of the fig tree in the top thereof: but they went in to Beelphegor, and alienated themselves to that confusion, and became abominable, as those things were, which they loved."
Hosea,9,11,"As for Ephraim, their glory hath flown away like a bird from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception."
Hosea,9,12,"And though they should bring up their children, I will make them without children among men: yea, and woe to them, when I shall depart from them."
Hosea,9,13,"Ephraim, as I saw, was a Tyre founded in beauty: and Ephraim shall bring out his children to the murderer."
Hosea,9,14,"Give them, O Lord. What wilt thou give them? Give them a womb without children, and dry breasts."
Hosea,9,15,"All their wickedness is in Galgal, for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their devices I will cast them forth out of my house: I will love them no more, all their princes are revolters."
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim is struck, their root is dried up, they shall yield no fruit. And if they should have issue, I will slay the best beloved fruit of their womb."
Hosea,9,17,"My God will cast them away, because they hearkened not to him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations."
Hosea,10,1,"Israel a vine full of branches, the fruit is agreeable to it: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath multiplied altars, according to the plenty of his land he hath abounded with idols."
Hosea,10,2,"Their heart is divided: now they shall perish: he shall break down their idols, he shall destroy their altars."
Hosea,10,3,For now they shall say: We have no king: because we fear not the Lord: and what shall a king do to us?
Hosea,10,4,"You speak words of an unprofitable vision, and you shall make a covenant: and judgment shall spring up as bitterness in the furrows of the field."
Hosea,10,5,"The inhabitants of Samaria have worshipped the king of Bethaven: for the people thereof have mourned over it, and the wardens of its temple that rejoiced over it in its glory because it is departed from it."
Hosea,10,6,"For itself also is carried into Assyria, a present to the avenging king: shame shall fall upon Ephraim, and Israel shall be confounded in his own will."
Hosea,10,7,Samaria hath made her king to pass as froth upon the face of the water.
Hosea,10,8,"And the high places of the idol, the sin of Israel shall be destroyed: the bur and the thistle shall grow up over their altars: and they shall say to the mountains: Cover us; and to the hills: Fall upon us."

Micah,1,10,"Declare ye it not in Geth, weep ya not with tears: in the house of Dust sprinkle yourselves with dust."
Micah,1,11,"And pass away, O thou that dwellest in the Beautiful place, covered with thy shame: she went not forth that dwelleth in the confines: the House adjoining shall receive mourning from you, which stood by herself."

Zephaniah,1,12,"And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and will visit upon the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their hearts: The Lord will not do good, nor will he do evil."
Zephaniah,1,13,"And their strength shall become a booty, and their houses as a desert: and they shall build houses, and shall not dwell in them: and they shall plant vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them."
Zephaniah,1,14,"The great day of the Lord is near, it is near and exceeding swift: the voice of the day of the Lord is bitter, the mighty man shall there meet with tribulation."
Zephaniah,1,15,"That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and distress, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and obscurity, a day of clouds and whirlwinds,"
Zephaniah,1,16,"A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high bulwarks."
Zephaniah,1,17,"And I will distress men, and they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord: and their blood shall be poured out as earth, and their bodies as dung."
Zephaniah,1,18,"Neither shall their silver and their gold be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: all the land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy, for he shall make even a speedy destruction of all them that dwell in the land."
Zephaniah,2,1,"Assemble yourselves together, be gathered together, O nation not worthy to be loved:"
Zephaniah,2,2,"Before the decree bring forth the day as dust passing away, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord’s indignation come upon you."
Zephaniah,2,3,"Seek the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, you that have wrought his judgment: seek the just, seek the meek: if by any means you may be hid in the day of the Lord’s indignation. Judgment on the Philistines (Jeremiah 47:1–7)"

Zephaniah,2,5,"Woe to you that inhabit the sea coast, O nation of reprobates: the word of the Lord upon you, O Chanaan, the land of the Philistines, and I will destroy thee, so that there shall not be an inhabitant."
Zephaniah,2,6,"And the sea coast shall be the resting place of shepherds, and folds for cattle:"
Zephaniah,2,7,"And it shall be the portion of him that shall remain of the house of Juda, there they shall feed: in the houses of Ascalon they shall rest in the evening: because the Lord their God will visit them, and bring back their captivity. Judgment on Moab and Ammon (Isaiah 16:1–14; Jeremiah 48:1–47)"
Zephaniah,2,8,"I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the blasphemies of the children of Ammon, with which they reproached my people, and have magnified themselves upon their borders."
Zephaniah,2,9,"Therefore as I live, saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrha, the dryness of thorns, and heaps of salt, and a desert even for ever: the remnant of my people shall make a spoil of them, and the residue of my nation shall possess them."
Zephaniah,2,10,"This shall befall them for their pride: because they have blasphemed, and have been magnified"

Zephaniah,2,13,"And he will stretch out his hand upon the north, and will destroy Assyria: and he will make the beautiful city a wilderness, and as a place not passable, and as a desert."
Zephaniah,2,14,"And flocks shall lie down in the midst thereof, all the beasts of the nations: and the bittern and the urchin shall lodge in the threshold thereof: the voice of the singing bird in the window, the raven on the upper post, for I will consume her strength."
Zephaniah,2,15,"This is the glorious city that dwelt in security: that said in her heart: I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desert, a place for beasts to lie down in? every one that passeth by her, shall hiss, and wag his hand."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Woe to the provoking, and redeemed city, the dove."
Zephaniah,3,2,"She hath not hearkened to the voice, neither hath she received discipline: she hath not trusted in the Lord, she drew not near to her God."
Zephaniah,3,3,"Her princes are in the midst of her as roaring lions: her judges are evening wolves, they left nothing for the morning."
Zephaniah,3,4,"Her prophets are senseless men without faith: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have acted unjustly against the law."
Zephaniah,3,5,"The just Lord is in the midst thereof, he will not do iniquity: in the morning, in the morning he will bring his judgment to light, and it shall not be hid: but the wicked man hath not known shame. Purification of the Nations"
Zephaniah,3,6,"I have destroyed the nations, and their towers are beaten down: I have made their ways desert, so that there is none that passeth by: their cities are desolate, there is not a man remaining, nor any inhabitant."
Zephaniah,3,7,"I said: Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive correction: and her dwelling shall not perish, for all things wherein I have visited her: but they rose early and corrupted all their thoughts."
Zephaniah,3,8,"Wherefore expect me, saith the Lord, in the day of my resurrection that is to come, for my judgment is to assemble the Gentiles, and to gather the kingdoms: and to pour upon them my indignation, all my fierce anger: for with the fire of my jealousy shall all the earth be devoured. A Faithful Remnant"
Zephaniah,3,9,"Because then I will restore to the people a chosen lip, that all may call upon the name of the Lord, and may serve him with one shoulder."
Zephaniah,3,10,"From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, shall my suppliants the children of my dispersed people bring me an offering."
Zephaniah,3,11,"In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proud boasters, and thou shalt no more be lifted up because of my holy mountain."
Zephaniah,3,12,And I will leave in the midst of thee a poor and needy people: and they shall hope in the name of the Lord.
Zephaniah,3,13,"The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed, and shall lie down, and there shall be none to make them afraid. Israel’s Restoration"
Zephaniah,3,14,"Give praise, O daughter of Sion: shout, O Israel: be glad, and rejoice with all thy heart, O daughter of Jerusalem."
Zephaniah,3,15,"The Lord hath taken away thy judgment, he hath turned away thy enemies: the king of Israel the Lord is in the midst of thee, thou shalt fear evil no more."
Zephaniah,3,16,In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: Fear not: to Sion: Let not thy hands be weakened.
Zephaniah,3,17,"The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty, he will save: he will rejoice over thee with gladness, he will be silent in his love, he will be joyful over thee in praise."
Zephaniah,3,18,"The triflers that were departed from the law, I will gather together, because they were of thee: that thou mayest no more suffer reproach for them."
Zephaniah,3,19,"Behold I will cut off all that have afflicted thee at that time: and I will save her that halteth, and will gather her that was cast out: and I will get them praise, and a name, in all the land where they had been put to confusion."
Zephaniah,3,20,"At that time, when I will bring you: and at the time that I will gather you: for I will give you a name, and praise among all the people of the earth, when I shall have brought back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord."

John,5,34,But I receive not testimony from man: but
John,5,35,He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.
John,5,36,"But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to perfect; the works themselves, which I do, give testimony of me, that the Father hath sent me."

John,7,10,"But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were,"
John,7,11,"The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day, and said: Where is he?"
John,7,12,And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And
John,7,13,"Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews."
John,7,14,"Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught."
John,7,15,And the Jews

Romans,3,2,Much every way. First
Romans,3,3,For what if some of them have not believed? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid.
Romans,3,4,"But God is true; and every man a liar, as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy words, and mayest overcome when thou art judged."
Romans,3,5,"But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth"

Romans,3,9,"What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews, and Greeks, that they are all under sin."
Romans,3,10,As it is written: There is not any man just.
Romans,3,11,"There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God."
Romans,3,12,"All have turned out of the way; they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one."
Romans,3,13,Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.

Romans,3,19,"Now we know, that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law;"
Romans,3,20,Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin. Righteousness through Faith in Christ (Philippians 3:1–11)

Romans,5,6,"For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?"
Romans,5,7,For scarce

Romans,5,12,"Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon"
Romans,5,13,"For until the law sin was in the world; but sin was not imputed,"
Romans,5,14,"But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come."
Romans,5,15,"But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died; much more the grace"
Romans,5,16,"And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation; but grace"
Romans,5,17,"For if by one man’s offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift, and of justice, shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ."
Romans,5,18,"Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation; so also by the justice of one,"
Romans,5,19,"For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners;"

Romans,6,9,"Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall no more have dominion over him."
Romans,6,10,"For in that he died to sin, he died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God:"
Romans,6,11,"So do you also reckon, that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans,6,12,"Let no sin therefore reign in your mortal body, so as to obey the lusts thereof."
Romans,6,13,"Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto sin; but present yourselves to God, as those that are"

Romans,6,16,"Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey,"

Romans,6,18,"Being then freed from sin, we have been made servants of justice."
Romans,6,19,"I speak an human thing, because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity, unto iniquity; so now yield your members to serve justice, unto sanctification."
Romans,6,20,"For when you were the servants of sin, you were free men to justice."

1 Corinthians,6,16,"Or know you not, that he who is joined to a harlot, is made"
1 Corinthians,6,17,"But he who is joined to the Lord, is one spirit. The Temple of the Holy Spirit (Romans 12:1–8; 1 Corinthians 3:16–23)"
1 Corinthians,6,18,"Fly fornication. Every sin that a man doth, is without the body; but he that committeth fornication,"
1 Corinthians,6,19,"Or know you not, that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost,"
1 Corinthians,6,20,For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body.
1 Corinthians,7,1,NOW concerning the thing whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
1 Corinthians,7,2,"But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."
1 Corinthians,7,3,"Let the husband render the debt to his wife, and the wife also in like manner to the husband."
1 Corinthians,7,4,"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband. And in like manner the husband also hath not"
1 Corinthians,7,5,"Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer; and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your"
1 Corinthians,7,6,"But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment."
1 Corinthians,7,7,"For I would that all men were even as myself: but every one hath his proper gift from God; one after this manner, and another after that."
1 Corinthians,7,8,"But I say to the unmarried, and to the widows: It is good for them if they so continue, even as I."
1 Corinthians,7,9,"But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burnt."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"But to them that are married, not I but the Lord commandeth, that the wife depart not from her"
1 Corinthians,7,11,"And if she depart, that she remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife."
1 Corinthians,7,12,"For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she consent"
1 Corinthians,7,13,"And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not,"
1 Corinthians,7,14,For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife; and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband:
1 Corinthians,7,15,"But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases. But God hath called us in peace."
1 Corinthians,7,16,"For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband ? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife ? Live Your Calling"
1 Corinthians,7,17,"But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath called every one, so let him walk: and so"
1 Corinthians,7,18,"Is any man called, being circumcised ? let him not procure uncircumcision. Is"
1 Corinthians,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and"
1 Corinthians,7,20,Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.
1 Corinthians,7,21,"Wast thou called, being a bondman ? care not for it; but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather."
1 Corinthians,7,22,"For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord. Likewise he that is"
1 Corinthians,7,23,You are bought with a price; be not made the bondslaves
1 Corinthians,7,24,"Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God. The Unmarried and Widowed"
1 Corinthians,7,25,"Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; but I give counsel, as having obtained"
1 Corinthians,7,26,"I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity, that it"
1 Corinthians,7,27,Art thou bound to a wife ? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a
1 Corinthians,7,28,"But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned. And if a virgin marry, she hath"
1 Corinthians,7,29,"This therefore I say, brethren; the time is short; it remaineth, that they also who have wives, be as if they had none;"
1 Corinthians,7,30,"And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they"
1 Corinthians,7,31,"And they that use this world, as if they used it not: for the fashion of this world passeth away."
1 Corinthians,7,32,"But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife, is solicitous for the things"
1 Corinthians,7,33,"But he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things"
1 Corinthians,7,34,"And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that"
1 Corinthians,7,35,"And this I speak for your profit: not to cast a snare upon you; but for that which is decent, and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured, with regard to his virgin, for that she is above"
1 Corinthians,7,37,"For he that hath determined being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will; and"
1 Corinthians,7,38,"Therefore, both he that giveth his virgin in marriage, doth well; and he that giveth her not, doth better."
1 Corinthians,7,39,"A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband die, she is at liberty:"
1 Corinthians,7,40,"But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel; and I think that I also have the spirit of God."
1 Corinthians,8,1,"NOW concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge."
1 Corinthians,8,2,"And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath"
1 Corinthians,8,3,"But if any any love God, the same is known by him."
1 Corinthians,8,4,"But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that"
1 Corinthians,8,5,"For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for"
1 Corinthians,8,6,"Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him."
1 Corinthians,8,7,"But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol: eat"
1 Corinthians,8,8,"But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more; nor, if we eat not, shall we have"
1 Corinthians,8,9,But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.
1 Corinthians,8,10,"For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not his conscience, being weak,"
1 Corinthians,8,11,And through thy knowledge shall
1 Corinthians,8,12,"Now when you sin thus against the brethren,"
1 Corinthians,8,13,"Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother."
1 Corinthians,9,1,AM not I free? Am not I an apostle? Have not I seen Christ Jesus our Lord? Are not you my work in
1 Corinthians,9,2,"And if unto others I be not an apostle, but yet to you I am. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,9,3,My defence with them that do examine me is this.
1 Corinthians,9,4,Have not we power to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians,9,5,"Have we not power to carry about a woman, a sister, as well as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren"
1 Corinthians,9,6,"Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to do this?"
1 Corinthians,9,7,"Who serveth as a soldier at any time, at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth the flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"
1 Corinthians,9,8,Speak I these things according to man? Or doth not the law also say these things?
1 Corinthians,9,9,For it is written in the law of Moses: Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God
1 Corinthians,9,10,"Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes? For these things are written for our sakes: that he that plougheth, should plough in hope; and he that thrasheth, in hope to receive fruit."
1 Corinthians,9,11,"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?"
1 Corinthians,9,12,"If others be partakers of this power over you, why not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this"
1 Corinthians,9,13,"Know you not, that they who work in the holy place, eat the things that are of the holy place; and they that serve"
1 Corinthians,9,14,"So also the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel, should live by the gospel."
1 Corinthians,9,15,"But I have used none of these things. Neither have I written these things, that they should be so"
1 Corinthians,9,16,"For if I preach the gospel, it is no glory to me, for a necessity lieth upon me: for woe is unto me if I preach"
1 Corinthians,9,17,"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation"
1 Corinthians,9,18,"What is my reward then? That preaching the gospel, I may deliver the gospel without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. Paul the Servant to All"
1 Corinthians,9,19,"For whereas I was free as to all, I made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more."
1 Corinthians,9,20,And
1 Corinthians,9,21,"To them that are under the law, as if I were under the law, (whereas myself was not under the law,) that I might gain them that were under the law. To them that were without the law, as if I were without the law, (whereas I was not without"
1 Corinthians,9,22,"To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I became all things to all men, that I might save"
1 Corinthians,9,23,And I do all things for the gospel’s sake: that I may be made partaker thereof. Run Your Race to Win
1 Corinthians,9,24,"Know you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the prize ? So run that"
1 Corinthians,9,25,"And every one that striveth for the mastery, refraineth himself from all things: and"
1 Corinthians,9,26,I therefore so
1 Corinthians,9,27,"But I chastise my body, and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a castaway."
1 Corinthians,10,1,"FOR I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed"
1 Corinthians,10,2,"And all in Moses were baptized, in the cloud, and in the sea:"
1 Corinthians,10,3,And did all eat the
1 Corinthians,10,4,And all drank the same spiritual drink; (and they drank of the spiritual rock that
1 Corinthians,10,5,But with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert.
1 Corinthians,10,6,"Now these things were done in a figure of us, that we should not covet evil things as they also coveted."
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Neither become ye idolaters, as some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink,"
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and"
1 Corinthians,10,9,"Neither let us tempt Christ: as some of them tempted,"
1 Corinthians,10,10,"Neither do you murmur: as some of them murmured, and were"
1 Corinthians,10,11,Now all these things happened to them in figure: and they are written
1 Corinthians,10,12,Wherefore he that thinketh himself
1 Corinthians,10,13,"Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it. Flee from Idolatry (Exodus 20:22–26)"
1 Corinthians,10,14,"Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from the service of idols."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak as to wise men: judge ye
1 Corinthians,10,16,"The chalice of benediction, which we bless, is it not the communion of the"
1 Corinthians,10,17,For
1 Corinthians,10,18,Behold Israel according to
1 Corinthians,10,19,"What then ? Do I say, that"
1 Corinthians,10,20,"But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. And I would not that you should be"
1 Corinthians,10,21,"You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord, and the chalice of devils: you"
1 Corinthians,10,22,"Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient. All to God’s Glory (1 Peter 4:1–11)"
1 Corinthians,10,23,"All things are lawful for me, but all things do not edify."
1 Corinthians,10,24,"Let no man seek his own, but that which is"
1 Corinthians,10,25,"Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat; asking no question for conscience’ sake."
1 Corinthians,10,26,The
1 Corinthians,10,27,"If any of them that believe not, invite you, and you will"
1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if any man say: This has been sacrificed to idols, do not eat of it for his sake that told it, and for"
1 Corinthians,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not thy own, but the other’s. For why is my liberty judged by"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks ?"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God."
1 Corinthians,10,32,Be
1 Corinthians,10,33,"As I also in all things please all men, not seeking that which is profitable to myself, but to many, that may be saved."
1 Corinthians,11,1,"BE ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,2,"Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me: and keep my ordinances as I"
1 Corinthians,11,3,"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and"
1 Corinthians,11,4,Every man praying or prophesying
1 Corinthians,11,5,But every woman praying or prophesying with her head
1 Corinthians,11,6,"For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her"
1 Corinthians,11,7,"The man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but"
1 Corinthians,11,8,"For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man."
1 Corinthians,11,9,"For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man."
1 Corinthians,11,10,Therefore ought the
1 Corinthians,11,11,But yet neither is the man without
1 Corinthians,11,12,"For as the woman is of the man, so also"
1 Corinthians,11,13,"You yourselves judge: doth it become a woman, to"
1 Corinthians,11,14,"Doth not even nature itself teach you, that a man indeed, if he nourish"
1 Corinthians,11,15,"But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is"
1 Corinthians,11,16,"But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the church of God. Sharing in the Lord’s Supper (Matthew 26:20–30; Mark 14:17–26; Luke 22:14–23)"
1 Corinthians,11,17,"Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse."
1 Corinthians,11,18,"For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you; and"
1 Corinthians,11,19,"For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved, may be made"
1 Corinthians,11,20,"When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the"
1 Corinthians,11,21,For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and
1 Corinthians,11,22,"What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not ? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not."
1 Corinthians,11,23,"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same"
1 Corinthians,11,24,"And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat:"
1 Corinthians,11,25,"In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood:"
1 Corinthians,11,26,"For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come."
1 Corinthians,11,27,"Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty"
1 Corinthians,11,28,But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that
1 Corinthians,11,29,"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh"
1 Corinthians,11,30,Therefore are there many inform and weak
1 Corinthians,11,31,"But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"NOW concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant."
1 Corinthians,12,2,You know that when
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say the Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit;"
1 Corinthians,12,5,"And there are diversities of ministries, but"
1 Corinthians,12,6,"And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all."
1 Corinthians,12,7,And
1 Corinthians,12,8,"To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given"
1 Corinthians,12,9,"To another,"
1 Corinthians,12,10,"To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another, diverse kinds of"
1 Corinthians,12,11,"But all these things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will. The Body of Christ"
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For as the body is one, and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they"
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink."
1 Corinthians,12,14,"For the body also is not one member, but many."
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot should say, because I am not the hand,"
1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the ear should say, because I am not"
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If the whole body were the eye, where"
1 Corinthians,12,18,But now God hath
1 Corinthians,12,19,And if they all were one
1 Corinthians,12,20,"But now there are many members indeed, yet one body."
1 Corinthians,12,21,And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help; nor again the head to the feet: I have no need
1 Corinthians,12,22,"Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body, are more"
1 Corinthians,12,23,"And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour; and those that are our uncomely parts, have more abundant comeliness."
1 Corinthians,12,24,"But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which"
1 Corinthians,12,25,That there might be no schism in the body; but the members
1 Corinthians,12,26,"And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it; or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it. The Greater Gifts"
1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now you are the body of Christ, and members of member."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors; after that miracles; then the graces of healing, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of"
1 Corinthians,12,29,Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?
1 Corinthians,12,30,Are all workers of miracles? Have all
1 Corinthians,12,31,But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way.
1 Corinthians,13,1,"IF I speak with the tongues of men, and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding"
1 Corinthians,13,2,"And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I"
1 Corinthians,13,3,"And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely; is not puffed up;"
1 Corinthians,13,5,Is not
1 Corinthians,13,6,"Rejoiceth not in iniquity,"
1 Corinthians,13,7,"Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void, or tongues shall cease, or"
1 Corinthians,13,9,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part."
1 Corinthians,13,10,But when that which
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a"
1 Corinthians,13,12,We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face. Now I know I part; but
1 Corinthians,13,13,"And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"FOLLOW after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For he that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he"
1 Corinthians,14,3,"But he that prophesieth, speaketh to men unto edification, and exhortation, and"
1 Corinthians,14,4,"He that speaketh in a tongue, edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church."
1 Corinthians,14,5,"And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth, than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is"
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in"
1 Corinthians,14,11,"If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to"
1 Corinthians,14,12,"So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church."
1 Corinthians,14,13,"And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret."
1 Corinthians,14,14,For if I pray in a
1 Corinthians,14,15,"What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the"
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Else if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the"
1 Corinthians,14,17,For thou indeed
1 Corinthians,14,18,I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.
1 Corinthians,14,19,"But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also; than ten thousand words in a tongue."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brethren, do not become children in sense: but in malice be children, and in sense be perfect."
1 Corinthians,14,21,In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; and neither so will they
1 Corinthians,14,22,"Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; but"
1 Corinthians,14,23,"If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or an unlearned"
1 Corinthians,14,25,"The secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed. Orderly Worship"
1 Corinthians,14,26,"How is it then, brethren ? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine,"
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course, and let one interpret."
1 Corinthians,14,28,"But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church, and speak to himself and to God."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"And let the prophets speak, two or three; and let the rest judge."
1 Corinthians,14,30,But if any thing be revealed to
1 Corinthians,14,31,"For you may all prophesy one by one; that all may learn,"
1 Corinthians,14,32,And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
1 Corinthians,14,33,"For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints."
1 Corinthians,14,34,"Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be subject, as"
1 Corinthians,14,35,"But if they would learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a"
1 Corinthians,14,36,Or did the word of God come out from you ? Or came it only unto you ?
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If any seem to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are"
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if any man know not, he shall not be known."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy; and forbid not to speak with tongues."
1 Corinthians,14,40,"But let all things be done decently, and according to order."
1 Corinthians,15,1,"NOW I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have"
1 Corinthians,15,2,"By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that Christ died for our sins, according"
1 Corinthians,15,4,"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the"
1 Corinthians,15,5,And that he was seen by Cephas; and after that by the eleven.
1 Corinthians,15,6,"Then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once: of whom many remain until this present, and some are fallen"
1 Corinthians,15,7,"After that, he was seen by James, then by all the apostles."
1 Corinthians,15,8,"And last of all, he was seen also"
1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be"
1 Corinthians,15,10,"But by the grace of God, I am what I am; and his grace in me hath not been void, but I have laboured more abundantly than all they: yet not I,"
1 Corinthians,15,11,"For whether I, or they, so we preach, and so you have believed. The Resurrection of the Dead"
1 Corinthians,15,12,"Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say, that"

Hebrews,1,5,"For to which of the angels hath he said at any time, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"
Hebrews,1,6,"And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith: And let all the angels of God adore him."
Hebrews,1,7,"And to the angels indeed he saith: He that maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire."

Hebrews,3,15,"While it is said, To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation."
Hebrews,3,16,For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.

Hebrews,6,13,"For God making promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom he might swear,"
Hebrews,6,14,"Saying: Unless blessing I shall bless thee, and multiplying I shall multiply thee."
Hebrews,6,15,And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.
Hebrews,6,16,For men swear by one greater than themselves:
Hebrews,6,17,"Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed an oath:"
Hebrews,6,18,"That by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have the strongest"

Hebrews,6,20,"Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us, made a high priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech."
Hebrews,7,1,"For this Melchisedech was king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning"
Hebrews,7,2,"To whom also Abraham divided the tithes of all: who first indeed by interpretation, is king of justice: and then also king of Salem, that is, king of peace:"
Hebrews,7,3,"Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened unto the Son of God, continueth a priest for ever."
Hebrews,7,4,"Now consider how great this man is, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave tithes out of the"

Hebrews,7,11,"If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchisedech, and not"

Hebrews,7,17,"For he testifieth: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech."
Hebrews,7,18,"There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof: 19(For the law brought nothing to perfection,) but a bringing in of a better"
Hebrews,7,20,"And inasmuch as it is not without an oath, (for the others indeed were made priests without an oath;"
Hebrews,7,21,"But this with an oath, by him that said unto him: The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever.)"
Hebrews,7,22,By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
Hebrews,7,23,"And the others indeed were made many priests, because by reason of death they were not suffered"
Hebrews,7,24,"But this, for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood,"
Hebrews,7,25,Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by him; always living to make intercession for us.
Hebrews,7,26,"For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from"
Hebrews,7,27,Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer
Hebrews,7,28,"For the law maketh men priests, who have infirmity: but the word of the oath, which was since the law, the Son who is perfected for evermore."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on"
Hebrews,8,2,"A minister of the holies, and of the true"

Hebrews,8,6,"But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator of a better testament, which is established on better promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have been sought for a second."
Hebrews,8,8,"For finding fault with them, he saith: Behold, the days shall come, saith the Lord: and I will perfect unto the house of Israel, and unto the house of Juda, a new testament:"
Hebrews,8,9,"Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my testament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord."
Hebrews,8,10,"For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind, and in their heart will I write them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:"
Hebrews,8,11,"And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me from the least to the greatest of them:"
Hebrews,8,12,"Because I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins I will remember no more."
Hebrews,8,13,"Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth and groweth old, is near its end."
Hebrews,9,1,"The former indeed had also justifications of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary."
Hebrews,9,2,"For there was a tabernacle made the first, wherein were the candlesticks, and the table, and the setting forth of loaves,"
Hebrews,9,3,"And after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the holy of holies:"
Hebrews,9,4,"Having a golden censer, and the ark of the testament covered about on every part with gold, in which was a golden pot that had manna, and the rod of Aaron, that had blossomed, and the tables of the"
Hebrews,9,5,And over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the propitiatory: of which it is not needful to speak now particularly.
Hebrews,9,6,"Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests indeed always entered,"
Hebrews,9,7,"But into the second, the high priest alone, once a year: not"
Hebrews,9,8,"The Holy Ghost signifying this, that the way into the holies was not yet made manifest, whilst the former tabernacle was yet"

Hebrews,9,11,"But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect"

Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer being sprinkled, sanctify such as are"
Hebrews,9,14,"How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?"
Hebrews,9,15,"And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament: that by means of his death, for the redemption of those trangressions, which were under the former testament, they that are called may"

Hebrews,9,20,"Saying: This is the blood of the testament, which God hath enjoined unto"
Hebrews,9,21,"The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood."
Hebrews,9,22,"And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without shedding of blood there is no remission."
Hebrews,9,23,It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things should be cleansed with these: but the
Hebrews,9,24,"For Jesus is not entered into the holies made with hands, the patterns of the true: but into heaven itself, that he may appear now in the"
Hebrews,9,25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into"
Hebrews,9,26,"For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the world: but now once at the end of ages, he hath appeared for the destruction of sin,"
Hebrews,9,27,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment:"
Hebrews,9,28,So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many; the second time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation.
Hebrews,10,1,"For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things; by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer continually every year, can never make the comers thereunto"
Hebrews,10,2,For then they would have ceased to be offered: because the worshippers once cleansed
Hebrews,10,3,But in them there is made a commemoration of sins
Hebrews,10,4,For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away.
Hebrews,10,5,"Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith: Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not: but a body thou hast fitted to me:"
Hebrews,10,6,Holocausts for sin did not please thee.
Hebrews,10,7,"Then said I: Behold I come: in the head of the book it is written of me: that I should do thy will, O God."
Hebrews,10,8,"In saying before, Sacrifices, and oblations, and holocausts for sin thou wouldest not, neither are they"
Hebrews,10,9,"Then said I: Behold, I come to do thy will,"
Hebrews,10,10,"In the which will, we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once."
Hebrews,10,11,"And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering, and often offering the same sacrifices, which can"
Hebrews,10,12,"But this man offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right hand"
Hebrews,10,13,"From henceforth expecting, until his enemies be made his footstool."
Hebrews,10,14,For by one oblation
Hebrews,10,15,And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us. For after that he said:
Hebrews,10,16,"And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days, saith the Lord. I will give my laws in their hearts, and on their minds will I write them:"
Hebrews,10,17,And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.
Hebrews,10,18,"Now where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin. A Call to Persevere (Jude 1:17–23)"
