Exodus,22,14,"And when a man doth ask anything from his neighbour, and it hath been hurt or hath died—its owner not being with it—he doth certainly repay; 15if its owner is with it, he doth not repay,—if it is a hired thing, it hath come for its hire. Laws of Social Responsibility"

It is a burnt-offering to Jehovah, a sweet fragrance; a fire-offering it is to Jehovah. 19‘And thou hast taken the second ram, and Aaron hath laid—his sons also—their hands on the head of the ram, 20and thou hast slaughtered the ram, and hast taken of its blood, and hast put on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot, and hast sprinkled the blood on the altar round about; 21and thou hast taken of the blood which is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and hast sprinkled on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him, and he hath been hallowed, he, and his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him."
Exodus,29,22,"And thou hast taken from the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat which is covering the inwards, and the redundance on the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, and the right leg, for it is a ram of consecration, 23and one round cake of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one thin cake out of the basket of the unleavened things which is before Jehovah. 24‘And thou hast set the whole on the hands of Aaron, and on the hands of his sons, and hast waved them—a wave-offering before Jehovah; 25and thou hast taken them out of their hand, and hast made perfume on the altar beside the burnt-offering, for sweet fragrance before Jehovah; a fire-offering it is to Jehovah."
Exodus,29,26,"And thou hast taken the breast from the ram of the consecration which is for Aaron, and hast waved it—a wave-offering before Jehovah, and it hath become thy portion; 27and thou hast sanctified the breast of the wave-offering, and the leg of the heave-offering, which hath been waved, and which hath been lifted up from the ram of the consecration, of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons; 28and it hath been for Aaron and for his sons, by a statute age-during from the sons of Israel, for it is a heave-offering; and it is a heave offering from the sons of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace-offerings—their heave-offering to Jehovah. 29‘And the holy garments which are Aaron’s, are for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to consecrate in them their hand; 30seven days doth the priest in his stead (of his sons) put them on, when he goeth in unto the tent of meeting, to minister in the sanctuary. Food for the Priests 31‘And the ram of the consecration thou dost take, and hast boiled its flesh in the holy place; 32and Aaron hath eaten—his sons also—the flesh of the ram, and the bread which is in the basket, at the opening of the tent of meeting; 33and they have eaten those things by which there is atonement to consecrate their hand, to sanctify them; and a stranger doth not eat—for they are holy; 34and if there be left of the flesh of the consecration or of the bread till the morning, then thou hast burned that which is left with fire; it is not eaten, for it is holy. 35‘And thou hast done thus to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee; seven days thou dost consecrate their hand; 36and a bullock, a sin-offering, thou dost prepare daily for the atonements, and thou hast atoned for the altar, in thy making atonement on it, and hast anointed it to sanctify it; 37seven days thou dost make atonement for the altar, and hast sanctified it, and the altar hath been most holy; all that is coming against the altar is holy. The Daily Offerings (Numbers 28:1–8)"
Exodus,29,38,"And this is that which thou dost prepare on the altar; two lambs, sons of a year, daily continually; 39the one lamb thou dost prepare in the morning, and the second lamb thou dost prepare between the evenings; 40and a tenth deal of fine flour, mixed with beaten oil, a fourth part of a hin, and a libation, a fourth part of a hin, of wine, is for the one lamb. 41‘And the second lamb thou dost prepare between the evenings; according to the present of the morning, and according to its libation, thou dost prepare for it, for sweet fragrance, a fire-offering, to Jehovah:— 42a continual burnt-offering for your generations, at the opening of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah, whither I am met with you, to speak unto thee there, 43and I have met there with the sons of Israel, and it hath been sanctified by My honour. 44‘And I have sanctified the tent of meeting, and the altar, and Aaron and his sons I sanctify for being priests to Me, God Will Dwell among the People 45and I have tabernacled in the midst of the sons of Israel, and have become their God, 46and they have known that I am Jehovah their God, who hath brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I may tabernacle in their midst; I am Jehovah their God."
Exodus,30,1,"And thou hast made an altar for making perfume; of shittim wood thou dost make it; 2a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth, (it is square), and two cubits its height; its horns are of the same. 3‘And thou hast overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and thou hast made to it a crown of gold round about; 4and two rings of gold thou dost make to it under its crown; on its two ribs thou dost make them, on its two sides, and they have become places for staves, to bear it with them. 5‘And thou hast made the staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with gold; 6and thou hast put it before the vail, which is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat which is over the testimony, whither I am met with thee. 7‘And Aaron hath made perfume on it, perfume of spices, morning by morning; in his making the lamps right he doth perfume it, 8and in Aaron’s causing the lamps to go up between the evenings, he doth perfume it; a continual perfume before Jehovah to your generations. 9‘Ye do not cause strange perfume to go up upon it, and burnt-offering, and present, and libation ye do not pour out on it; 10and Aaron hath made atonement on its horns, once in a year, by the blood of the sin-offering of atonements; once in a year doth he make atonement for it, to your generations; it is most holy to Jehovah.’ The Census Offering (2 Samuel 24:1–9; 1 Chronicles 21:1–6)"

Leviticus,11,34,"Of all the food which is eaten, that on which cometh such water, is unclean, and all drink which is drunk in any such vessel is unclean; 35and anything on which any of their carcase falleth is unclean (oven or double pots), it is broken down, unclean they are, yea, unclean they are to you. 36‘Only—a fountain or pit, a collection of water, is clean, but that which is coming against their carcase is unclean; 37and when any of their carcase falleth on any sown seed which is sown—it is clean; 38and when water is put on the seed, and any of its carcase hath fallen on it— unclean it is to you. 39‘And when any of the beasts which are to you for food dieth, he who is coming against its carcase is unclean till the evening; 40and he who is eating of its carcase doth wash his garments, and hath been unclean till the evening; and he who is lifting up its carcase doth wash his garments, and hath been unclean till the evening. 41‘And every teeming thing which is teeming on the earth is an abomination, it is not eaten; 42any thing going on the belly, and any going on four, unto every multiplier of feet, to every teeming thing which is teeming on the earth—ye do not eat them, for they are an abomination; 43ye do not make yourselves abominable with any teeming thing which is teeming, nor do ye make yourselves unclean"
Leviticus,11,44,"For I am Jehovah your God, and ye have sanctified yourselves, and ye have been holy, for I am holy; and ye do not defile your persons with any teeming thing which is creeping on the earth; 45for I am Jehovah who am bringing you up out of the land of Egypt to become your God; and ye have been holy, for I am holy."
Leviticus,11,46,"This is a law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature which is moving in the waters, and of every creature which is teeming on the earth, 47to make separation between the unclean and the pure, and between the beast that is eaten, and the beast that is not eaten.’"
Leviticus,12,1,"And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying, 2‘Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, A woman when she giveth seed, and hath born a male, then she hath been unclean seven days, according to the days of separation for her sickness she is unclean; 3and in the eighth day is the flesh of his foreskin circumcised; 4and thirty and three days she doth abide in the blood of her cleansing; against any holy thing she doth not come, and unto the sanctuary she doth not go in, till the fulness of the days of her cleansing. 5‘And if a female she bear, then she hath been unclean two weeks, as in her separation; and sixty and six days she doth abide for the blood of her cleansing. 6‘And in the fulness of the days of her cleansing for son or for daughter she doth bring in a lamb, a son of a year, for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a sin-offering, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, unto the priest; 7and he hath brought it near before Jehovah, and hath made atonement for her, and she hath been cleansed from the fountain of her blood; this is the law of her who is bearing, in regard to a male or to a female. 8‘And if her hand find not the sufficiency of a sheep, then she hath taken two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, one for a burnt-offering, and one for a sin-offering, and the priest hath made atonement for her, and she hath been cleansed.’"

Leviticus,16,27,"And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood hath been brought in to make atonement in the sanctuary, doth one bring out unto the outside of the camp, and they have burnt with fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung; 28and he who is burning them doth wash his garments, and hath bathed his flesh with water, and afterwards he cometh in unto the camp. 29‘And it hath been to you for a statute age-during, in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month, ye humble yourselves, and do no work—the native, and the sojourner who is sojourning in your midst; 30for on this day he maketh atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins before Jehovah ye are clean; 31it is to you a sabbath of rest, and ye have humbled yourselves—a statute age-during. 32‘And the priest whom he doth anoint, and whose hand he doth consecrate to act as priest instead of his father, hath made atonement, and hath put on the linen garments, the holy garments; 33and he hath made atonement for the holy sanctuary; and for the tent of meeting, even for the altar he doth make atonement; yea, for the priests, and for all the people of the assembly he maketh atonement. 34‘And this hath been to you for a statute age-during, to make atonement for the sons of Israel, because of all their sins, once in a year;’ and he doth as Jehovah hath commanded Moses."

Laws against Eating Blood 10‘And any man of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners, who is sojourning in your midst, who eateth any blood, I have even set My face against the person who is eating the blood, and have cut him off from the midst of his people; 11for the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar, to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood which maketh atonement for the soul. 12‘Therefore I have said to the sons of Israel, No person among you doth eat blood, and the sojourner who is sojourning in your midst doth not eat blood; 13and any man of the sons of Israel, or of the sojourners, who is sojourning in your midst, who hunteth venison, beast or fowl, which is eaten— hath even poured out its blood, and hath covered it with dust; 14for it is the life of all flesh, its blood is for its life; and I say to the sons of Israel, Blood of any flesh ye do not eat, for the life of all flesh is its blood; any one eating it is cut off. 15‘And any person who eateth a carcase or torn thing, among natives or among sojourners—hath both washed his garments, and hath bathed with water, and hath been unclean until the evening—then he hath been clean; 16and if he wash not, and his flesh bathe not—then he hath borne his iniquity.’"

The Showbread (Exodus 25:23–30; Exodus 37:10–16) 5‘And thou hast taken flour, and hast baked twelve cakes with it, two tenth deals are in the one cake, 6and thou hast set them two ranks (six in the rank) on the pure table before Jehovah, 7and thou hast put on the rank pure frankincense, and it hath been to the bread for a memorial, a fire-offering to Jehovah. 8‘On each sabbath-day he arrangeth it before Jehovah continually, from the sons of Israel— a covenant age-during; 9and it hath been to Aaron, and to his sons, and they have eaten it in the holy place, for it is most holy to him, from the fire-offerings of Jehovah—a statute age-during.’ Punishment for Blasphemy"

The Blessing of Obedience (Deuteronomy 28:1–14) 18‘And ye have done My statutes, and My judgments ye keep, and have done them, and ye have dwelt on the land confidently, 19and the land hath given its fruit, and ye have eaten to satiety, and have dwelt confidently on it. 20‘And when ye say, What do we eat in the seventh year, lo, we do not sow, nor gather our increase? 21then I have commanded My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it hath made the increase for three years; 22and ye have sown the eighth year, and have eaten of the old increase; until the ninth year, until the coming in of its increase, ye do eat the old. The Law of Redemption"
Leviticus,25,23,"And the land is not sold—to extinction, for the land is Mine, for sojourners and settlers are ye with Me; 24and in all the land of your possession a redemption ye do give to the land. 25‘When thy brother becometh poor, and hath sold his possession, then hath his redeemer who is near unto him come, and he hath redeemed the sold thing of his brother; 26and when a man hath no redeemer, and his own hand hath attained, and he hath found as sufficient for its redemption, 27then he hath reckoned the years of its sale, and hath given back that which is over to the man to whom he sold it, and he hath returned to his possession. 28‘And if his hand hath not found sufficiency to give back to him, then hath his sold thing been in the hand of him who buyeth it till the year of jubilee; and it hath gone out in the jubilee, and he hath returned to his possession."
Leviticus,25,29,"And when a man selleth a dwelling-house in a walled city, then hath his right of redemption been until the completion of a year from its selling; days—is his right of redemption; 30and if it is not redeemed until the fulness to him of a perfect year, then hath the house which is in a walled city been established to extinction to the buyer of it, to his generations; it goeth not out in the jubilee; 31and a house of the villages which have no wall round about, on the field of the country is reckoned; redemption is to it, and in the jubilee it goeth out. 32‘As to cities of the Levites—houses of the cities of their possession—redemption age-during is to the Levites; 33as to him who redeemeth from the Levites, both the sale of a house and the city of his possession have gone out in the jubilee, for the houses of"

Redemption of Servants"

Numbers,29,40,And Moses saith unto the sons of Israel according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
Numbers,30,1,"And Moses speaketh unto the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, ‘This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded: 2‘When a man voweth a vow to Jehovah, or hath sworn an oath to bind a bond on his soul, he doth not pollute his word; according to all that is going out from his mouth he doth. 3‘And when a woman voweth a vow to Jehovah, and hath bound a bond in the house of her father in her youth, 4and her father hath heard her vow, and her bond which she hath bound on her soul, and her father hath kept silent at her, then have all her vows been established, and every bond which she hath bound on her soul is established. 5‘And if her father hath disallowed her in the day of his hearing, none of her vows and her bonds which she hath bound on her soul is established, and Jehovah is propitious to her, for her father hath disallowed her."

Deuteronomy,12,1,"These are the statutes and the judgments which ye observe to do in the land which Jehovah, God of thy fathers, hath given to thee to possess it, all the days that ye are living on the ground: 2ye do utterly destroy all the places where the nations which ye are dispossessing served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the heights, and under every green tree; 3and ye have broken down their altars, and shivered their standing pillars, and their shrines ye burn with fire, and graven images of their gods ye cut down, and have destroyed their name out of that place. 4‘Ye do not do so to Jehovah your God; 5but unto the place which Jehovah your God doth choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, to His tabernacle ye seek, and thou hast entered thither, 6and hast brought in thither your burnt- offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your free-will offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock; 7and ye have eaten there before Jehovah your God, and have rejoiced in every putting forth of your hand, ye and your households, with which Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee. 8‘Ye do not do according to all that we are doing here to-day, each anything that is right in his own eyes, 9for ye have not come in hitherto unto the rest, and unto the inheritance, which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee; 10and ye have passed over the Jordan, and have dwelt in the land which Jehovah your God is causing you to inherit, and He hath given rest to you from all your enemies round about, and ye have dwelt confidently: 11‘And it hath been, the place on which Jehovah your God doth fix to cause His name to tabernacle there, thither ye bring in all that which I am commanding you, your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all the choice of your vows which ye vow to Jehovah; 12and ye have rejoiced before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your handmaids, and the Levite who is within your gates, for he hath no part and inheritance with you. 13‘Take heed to thee, lest thou cause thy burnt-offerings to ascend in any place which thou seest, 14except in the place which Jehovah doth choose in one of thy tribes, there thou dost cause thy burnt- offerings to ascend, and there thou dost do all that which I am commanding thee. 15‘Only, with all the desire of thy soul thou dost sacrifice, and hast eaten flesh according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which He hath given to thee, in all thy gates; the unclean and the clean do eat it, as of the roe, and as of the hart. 16‘Only, the blood ye do not eat—on the earth thou dost pour it as water; 17thou art not able to eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, and of thy new wine, and thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd and of thy flock, and any of thy vows which thou vowest, and thy free-will offerings, and heave-offering of thy hand; 18but before Jehovah thy God thou dost eat it, in the place which Jehovah thy God doth fix on, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man- servant, and thy handmaid, and the Levite who is within thy gates, and thou hast rejoiced before Jehovah thy God in every putting forth of thy hand; 19take heed to thee lest thou forsake the Levite all thy days on thy ground. 20‘When Jehovah thy God doth enlarge thy border, as He hath spoken to thee, and thou hast said, Let me eat flesh—for thy soul desireth to eat flesh—of all the desire of thy soul thou dost eat flesh. 21‘When the place is far from thee which Jehovah thy God doth choose to put His name there, then thou hast sacrificed of thy herd and of thy flock which Jehovah hath given to thee, as I have commanded thee, and hast eaten within thy gates, of all the desire of thy soul; 22only, as the roe and the hart is eaten,"
Deuteronomy,12,23,"Only, be sure not to eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and thou dost not eat the life with the flesh; 24thou dost not eat it, on the earth thou dost pour it as water; 25thou dost not eat it, in order that it may be well with thee, and with thy sons after thee, when thou dost that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah. 26‘Only, thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou dost take up, and hast gone in unto the place which Jehovah doth choose, 27and thou hast made thy burnt-offerings—the flesh and the blood—on the altar of Jehovah thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices is poured out by the altar of Jehovah thy God, and the flesh thou dost eat."

Deuteronomy,13,15,"Thou dost surely smite the inhabitants of that city by the mouth of the sword; devoting it, and all that is in it, even its cattle, by the mouth of the sword; 16and all its spoil thou dost gather unto the midst of its broad place, and hast burned with fire the city and all its spoil completely, before Jehovah thy God, and it hath been a heap age-during, it is not built any more; 17and there doth not cleave to thy hand any of the devoted thing, so that Jehovah doth turn back from the fierceness of His anger, and hath given to thee mercies, and loved thee, and multiplied thee, as He hath sworn to thy fathers, 18when thou dost hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep all his commands which I am commanding thee to-day, to do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God."

Courts of Law 8‘When anything is too hard for thee for judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke—matters of strife within thy gates—then thou hast risen, and gone up unto the place on which Jehovah thy God doth fix, 9and hast come in unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge who is in those days, and hast inquired, and they have declared to thee the word of judgment, 10and thou hast done according to the tenor of the word which they declare to thee (they of that place which Jehovah doth choose; and thou hast observed to do according to all that they direct thee. 11‘According to the tenor of the law which they direct thee, and according to the judgment which they say to thee thou dost do; thou dost not turn aside from the word which they declare to thee, right"

Deuteronomy,18,13,"Perfect thou art with Jehovah thy God, 14for these nations whom thou art possessing, unto observers of clouds, and unto diviners, do hearken; and thou—not so hath Jehovah thy God suffered thee. A Prophet Like Moses (Acts 3:11–26) 15‘A prophet out of thy midst, out of thy brethren, like to me, doth Jehovah thy God raise up to thee— unto him ye hearken; 16according to all that thou didst ask from Jehovah thy God, in Horeb, in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not add to hear the voice of Jehovah my God, and this great fire let me not see any more, and I die not; 17and Jehovah saith unto me, They have done well that they have spoken; 18a prophet I raise up to them, out of the midst of their brethren, like to thee; and I have given my words in his mouth, and he hath spoken unto them all that which I command him; 19and it hath been—the man who doth not hearken unto My words which he doth speak in My name, I require it of him. 20‘Only, the prophet who presumeth to speak a word in My name—that which I have not commanded him to speak—and who speaketh in the name of other gods—even that prophet hath died. 21‘And when thou sayest in thy heart, How do we know the word which Jehovah hath not spoken?— 22that which the prophet speaketh in the name of Jehovah, and the thing is not, and cometh not—it is the word which Jehovah hath not spoken; in presumption hath the prophet spoken it;—thou art not afraid of him."
Deuteronomy,19,3,"Thou dost prepare for thee the way, and hast divided into three parts the border of thy land which Jehovah thy God doth cause thee to inherit, and it hath been for the fleeing thither of every man-slayer."
Deuteronomy,19,4,"And this is the matter of the man-slayer who fleeth thither, and hath lived: He who smiteth his neighbour unknowingly, and is not hating him heretofore, 5even he who cometh in with his neighbour into a forest to hew wood, and his hand hath driven with an axe to cut the tree, and the iron hath slipped from the wood, and hath met his neighbour, and he hath died—he doth flee unto one of these cities, and hath lived, 6lest the redeemer of blood pursue after the man-slayer when his heart is hot, and hath overtaken him (because the way is great), and hath smitten him—the life, and he hath no sentence of death, for he is not hating him heretofore; 7therefore I am commanding thee, saying, Three cities thou dost separate to thee. 8‘And if Jehovah thy God doth enlarge thy border, as He hath sworn to thy fathers, and hath given to thee all the land which He hath spoken to give to thy fathers— 9when thou keepest all this command to do it, which I am commanding thee to-day, to love Jehovah thy God, and to walk in His ways all the days—then thou hast added to thee yet three cities to these three; 10and innocent blood is not shed in the midst of thy land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee—an inheritance, and there hath been upon thee blood. 11‘And when a man is hating his neighbour, and hath lain in wait for him, and risen against him, and smitten him—the life, and he hath died, and he hath fled unto one of these cities, 12then the elders of his city have sent and taken him from thence, and given him into the hand of the redeemer of blood, and he hath died; 13thine eye hath no pity on him, and thou hast put away the innocent blood from Israel, and it is well with thee. 14‘Thou dost not remove a border of thy neighbour, which they of former times have made, in thine inheritance, which thou dost inherit in the land which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee to possess it. The Testimony of Two or Three Witnesses (Matthew 18:15–20) 15‘One witness doth not rise against a man for any iniquity, and for any sin, in any sin which he sinneth; by the mouth of two witnesses, or by the mouth of three witnesses, is a thing established. 16‘When a violent witness doth rise against a man, to testify against him apostasy, 17then have both the men who have the strife stood before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges who are in those days, 18and the judges have searched diligently, and lo, the witness is a false witness, a falsehood he hath testified against his brother: 19‘Then ye have done to him as he devised to do to his brother, and thou hast put away the evil thing out of thy midst, 20and those who are left do hear and fear, and add not to do any more according to this evil thing in thy midst; 21and thine eye doth not pity—life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."

Lo, the heavens, and the heavens of the heavens, do not contain Thee, how much less this house that I have built?) 19‘And Thou hast turned unto the prayer of Thy servant, and unto his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and unto the prayer that Thy servant is praying before Thee, 20for Thine eyes being open towards this house by day and by night, towards the place that Thou hast said to put Thy name there, to hearken unto the prayer that Thy servant prayeth towards this place. 21‘And Thou hast hearkened unto the supplications of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, that they pray towards this place, and Thou dost hear from the place of Thy dwelling, from the heavens, and hast hearkened, and forgiven. 22‘If a man doth sin against his neighbour, and he hath lifted up on him an oath to cause him to swear, and the oath hath come in before Thine altar in this house— 23then Thou dost hear from the heavens, and hast done, and hast judged Thy servants, to give back to the wicked, to put his way on his head, and to declare righteous the righteous, to give to him according to his righteousness. 24‘And if Thy people Israel is smitten before an enemy, because they sin against Thee, and they have turned back and confessed Thy name, and prayed and made supplication before Thee in this house— 25then Thou dost hear from the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Thy people Israel, and caused them to turn back unto the ground that Thou hast given to them, and to their fathers. 26‘In the heavens being restrained, and there is no rain, because they sin against Thee, and they have prayed towards this place, and confessed Thy name—from their sin they turn back because Thou dost afflict them— 27then Thou dost hear in the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, because Thou directest them unto the good way in which they walk, and hast given rain on Thy land that Thou hast given to Thy people for an inheritance. 28‘Famine, when it is in the land, pestilence, when it is, blasting, and mildew, locust, and caterpillar, when they are, when its enemies have distressed it in the land—its gates, any plague and any sickness; 29any prayer, any supplication that is for any man, and for all Thy people Israel, when they know each his own plague, and his own pain, and he hath spread out his hands towards this house: 30then Thou dost hear from the heavens, the settled place of Thy dwelling, and hast forgiven, and hast given to each according to all his ways (because Thou knowest his heart, for Thou—Thou only—hast known the heart of the sons of men), 31so that they fear Thee, to walk in Thy ways, all the days that they are living on the face of the ground that Thou hast given to our fathers. 32‘And also, unto the stranger who is not of Thy people Israel, and he hath come from a land afar off for the sake of Thy great name, and Thy strong hand, and Thy stretched-out arm, and they have come in and prayed towards this house: 33then Thou dost hear from the heavens, from the settled place of Thy dwelling, and hast done according to all that the stranger calleth unto Thee for: so that all the peoples of the earth do know Thy name, so as to fear Thee, as Thy people Israel, and to know that Thy name is called on this house that I have built. 34‘When Thy people doth go out to battle against its enemies in the way that Thou dost send them, and they have prayed unto Thee the way of this city that Thou hast fixed on, and the house that I have built for Thy name: 35then Thou hast heard from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and hast maintained their cause. 36‘When they sin against Thee—for there is not a man who sinneth not—and Thou hast been angry with them, and hast given them before an enemy, and taken them captive have their captors, unto a land far off or near; 37and they have turned it back unto their heart in the land whither they have been taken captive, and have turned back, and made supplication unto Thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have done wickedly; 38yea, they have turned back unto Thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their captivity, whither they have taken them captive, and they have prayed the way of their land that Thou hast given to their fathers, and of the city that Thou hast chosen, and of the house that I have built for Thy name: 39then Thou hast heard from the heavens, from the settled place of Thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications, and hast maintained their cause, and forgiven Thy people who have sinned against Thee. 40‘Now, my God, let, I beseech Thee, Thine eyes be open, and Thine ears attentive, to the prayer of this place: 41and now, rise, O Jehovah God, to Thy rest, Thou, and the ark of Thy strength; Thy priests, O Jehovah God, are clothed with salvation, and Thy saints rejoice in the goodness,"

Ezra,7,22,"Unto silver a hundred talents, and unto wheat a hundred cors, and unto wine a hundred baths, and unto oil a hundred baths, and salt without reckoning; 23all that is by the decree of the God of heaven, let be done diligently for the house of the God of heaven; for why is there wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons? 24‘And to you we are making known, that upon any of the priests and Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, and servants of the house of God, tribute and custom there is no authority to lift up."
Ezra,7,25,"And thou, Ezra, according to the wisdom of thy God, that is in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges who may be judges to all the people who are beyond the river, to all knowing the law of thy God, and he who hath not known ye cause to know; 26and any who doth not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, speedily is judgment done upon him, whether to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of riches, and to bonds.’ Ezra Blesses God"
Ezra,7,27,"Blessed is Jehovah, God of our fathers, who hath given such a thing as this in the heart of the king, to beautify the house of Jehovah that is in Jerusalem, 28and unto me hath stretched out kindness before the king and his counsellors, and before all the mighty heads of the king: and I have strengthened myself as the hand of Jehovah my God is upon me, and I gather out of Israel heads to go up with me."

Fasting for Protection"
Ezra,8,21,"And I proclaim there a fast, by the river Ahava, to afflict ourselves before our God, to seek from Him a right way for us, and for our infants, and for all our substance, 22for I was ashamed to ask from the king a force and horsemen to help us because of the enemy in the way, for we spake to the king, saying, ‘The hand of our God is upon all seeking Him for good, and His strength and His wrath is upon"
Ezra,8,23,"And we fast, and seek from our God for this, and He is entreated of us. Priests to Guard the Offerings"
Ezra,8,24,"And I separate from the heads of the priests, twelve, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them of their brethren ten, 25and I weigh to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, a heave-offering of the house of our God, that the king, and his counsellors, and his heads, and all Israel—those present— lifted up; 26and I weigh to their hand, of silver, talents six hundred and fifty, and of vessels of silver a hundred talents, of gold a hundred talents, 27and basins of gold twenty, of a thousand drams, and two"

Ezra,8,33,"And on the fourth day hath been weighed the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, in the house of our God, unto the hand of Meremoth son of Uriah the priest, and with him Eleazar son of Phinehas, and with them Jozabad son of Jeshua, and Noadiah son of Binnui, the Levites: 34by number, by weight of every one, and all the weight is written at that time."
Ezra,8,35,"Those coming in of the captives—sons of the removal—have brought near burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, bullocks twelve, for all Israel, rams ninety and six, lambs seventy and seven, young he-goats for a sin-offering twelve—the whole a burnt-offering to Jehovah; 36and they give the laws of the king to the lieutenants of the king and the governors beyond the river, and they have lifted up the people and the house of God."
Ezra,9,1,"And at the completion of these things, drawn nigh unto me have the heads, saying, ‘The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not been separated from the peoples of the lands, as to their abominations, even the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, the Egyptian, and the Amorite, 2for they have taken of their daughters to them, and to their sons, and the holy seed have mingled themselves among the peoples of the lands, and the hand of"

Ezra,9,7,"From the days of our fathers we are in great guilt unto this day, and in our iniquities we have been given—we, our kings, our priests—into the hand of the kings of the lands, with sword, with captivity, and with spoiling, and with shame of face, as at this day. 8‘And now, as a small moment hath grace been from Jehovah our God, to leave to us an escape, and to give to us a nail in His holy place, by our God’s enlightening our eyes, and by giving us a little quickening in our servitude; 9for servants we are, and in our servitude our God hath not forsaken us, and stretcheth out unto us kindness before the kings of Persia, to give to us a quickening to lift up the house of our God, and to cause its wastes to cease, and to give to us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem. 10‘And now, what do we say, O our God, after this? for we have forsaken Thy commands, 11that Thou hast commanded by the hands of thy servants the prophets, saying, The land into which ye are going to possess it, is a land of impurity, by the impurity of the people of the lands, by their abominations with which they have filled it—from mouth unto mouth—by their uncleanness; 12and now, your daughters ye do not give to their sons, and their daughters ye do not take to your sons, and ye do not seek their peace, and their good—unto the age, so that ye are strong, and have eaten the good of the land, and given possession to your sons unto the age. 13‘And after all that hath come upon us for our evil works, and for our great guilt (for Thou, O our God, hast kept back of the rod from our iniquities, and hast given to us an escape like this), 14do we turn back to break Thy commands, and to join ourselves in marriage with the people of these abominations? art not Thou angry against us—even to"

Ezra,10,9,"And gathered are all the men of Judah and Benjamin to Jerusalem by the third day, it is the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month, and all the people sit in the broad place of the house of God,"
Ezra,10,10,"And Ezra the priest riseth, and saith unto them, ‘Ye—ye have trespassed, and ye settle strange women, to add to the guilt of Israel; 11and, now, make confession to Jehovah, God of your fathers, and do His good pleasure, and be separated from"

Those Guilty of Intermarriage"

Nehemiah,5,6,"And it is very displeasing to me when I have heard their cry and these words, 7and my heart reigneth over me, and I strive with the freemen, and with the prefects, and say to them, ‘Usury one upon another ye are exacting;’ and I set against them a great assembly, 8and say to them, ‘We have acquired our brethren the Jews, those sold to the nations, according to the ability that is in us, and ye also sell"

Nehemiah,5,14,"Also, from the day that he appointed me to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the thirty and second year of Artaxerxes the king—twelve years—I, and my brethren, the bread of the governor have not eaten: 15the former governors who are before me have made themselves heavy on the people, and take of them in bread and wine, besides in silver forty shekels; also, their servants have ruled over the people—and I have not done so, because of the fear of God."
Nehemiah,5,16,"And also, in the work of this wall I have done mightily, even a field we have not bought, and all my servants are gathered there for the work; 17and of the Jews, and of the prefects, a hundred and fifty men, and those coming in unto us of the nations that are round about us, are at my table; 18and that which hath been prepared for one day is one ox, six fat sheep, also fowls have been prepared for me, and once in ten days of all wines abundantly, and with this, the bread of the governor I have not"

Nehemiah,9,36,"Lo, we—to-day—are servants, and the land that Thou hast given to our fathers, to eat its fruit and its good—lo, we are servants on it, 37and its increase it is multiplying to the kings whom Thou hast set over us in our sins; and over our bodies they are ruling, and over our cattle, according to their pleasure, and we are in great distress."

Esther,9,20,"And Mordecai writeth these things, and sendeth letters unto all the Jews who are in all provinces of the king Ahasuerus, who are near and who are far off, 21to establish on them, to be keeping the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and the fifteenth day of it, in every year and year, 22as days on which the Jews have rested from their enemies, and the month that hath been turned to them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning to a good day, to make them days of banquet and of joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the needy."
Esther,9,23,"And the Jews have received that which they had begun to do, and that which Mordecai hath written unto them, 24because Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, adversary of all the Jews, had devised concerning the Jews to destroy them, and had caused to fall Pur—that is the lot—to crush them and to destroy them; 25and in her coming in before the king, he said with the letter, ‘Let his evil device that he devised against the Jews turn back upon his own head,’ and they have hanged him and his sons on the tree, 26therefore they have called these days Purim—by the name of the lot—therefore, because of all the words of this letter, and what they have seen concerning this, and what hath come unto them, 27the Jews have established and received upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all those joined unto them, and it doth not pass away, to be keeping these two days according to their writing, and according to their season, in every year and year; 28and these days are remembered and kept in every generation and generation, family and family, province and province, and city and city, and these days of Purim do not pass away from the midst of the Jews, and their memorial is not ended from their seed."
Esther,9,29,"And Esther the queen, daughter of Abihail, writeth, and Mordecai the Jew, with all might, to establish this second letter of Purim, 30and he sendeth letters unto all the Jews, unto the seven and twenty and a hundred provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus—words of peace and truth— 31to establish these days of Purim, in their seasons, as Mordecai the Jew hath established on them, and Esther the queen, and as they had established on themselves, and on their seed—matters of the fastings, and of their"

Job,18,6,"The light hath been dark in his tent, And his lamp over him is extinguished."

Job,20,17,"He looketh not on rivulets, Flowing of brooks of honey and butter."
Job,20,18,"He is giving back what he laboured for, And doth not consume it; As a bulwark is his exchange, and he exults not."
Job,20,19,"For he oppressed—he forsook the poor, A house he hath taken violently away, And he doth not build it."

Job,21,32,And he—to the graves he is brought. And over the heap a watch is kept.
Job,21,33,"Sweet to him have been the clods of the valley, And after him every man he draweth, And before him there is no numbering."
Job,21,34,"And how do ye comfort me with vanity, And in your answers hath been left trespass?"
Job,22,1,And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith:—
Job,22,2,"To God is a man profitable, Because a wise man to himself is profitable?"
Job,22,3,"Is it a delight to the Mighty One That thou art righteous? is it gain, That thou makest perfect thy ways?"
Job,22,4,Because of thy reverence Doth He reason with thee? He entereth with thee into judgment:

Job,22,21,"Acquaint thyself, I pray thee, with Him, And be at peace, Thereby thine increase is good."
Job,22,22,"Receive, I pray thee, from His mouth a law, And set His sayings in thy heart."
Job,22,23,"If thou dost return unto the Mighty Thou art built up, Thou puttest iniquity far from thy tents."
Job,22,24,"So as to set on the dust a defence, And on a rock of the valleys a covering."
Job,22,25,"And the Mighty hath been thy defence, And silver is strength to thee."
Job,22,26,"For then on the Mighty thou delightest thyself, And dost lift up unto God thy face,"
Job,22,27,"Thou dost make supplication unto Him, And He doth hear thee, And thy vows thou completest."
Job,22,28,"And thou decreest a saying, And it is established to thee, And on thy ways hath light shone."
Job,22,29,"For they have made low, And thou sayest, ‘Lift up.’ And the bowed down of eyes he saveth."
Job,22,30,"He delivereth the not innocent, Yea, he hath been delivered By the cleanness of thy hands."
Job,23,1,And Job answereth and saith:—
Job,23,2,"Also—to-day is my complaint bitter, My hand hath been heavy because of my sighing."
Job,23,3,"O that I had known—and I find Him, I come in unto His seat,"
Job,23,4,"I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill with arguments."
Job,23,5,"I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He saith to me."
Job,23,6,In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth it in me.
Job,23,7,"There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for ever from my judge."
Job,23,8,"Lo, forward I go—and He is not, And backward—and I perceive him not."
Job,23,9,"To the left in His working—and I see not, He is covered on the right, and I behold not."
Job,23,10,"For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me—as gold I go forth."
Job,23,11,"On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept, and turn not aside,"
Job,23,12,"The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth."
Job,23,13,"And He is in one mind, And who doth turn Him back? And His soul hath desired—and He doth it."
Job,23,14,"For He doth complete my portion, And many such things are with Him."
Job,23,15,"Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider, and am afraid of Him."
Job,23,16,"And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath troubled me."
Job,23,17,"For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me He covered thick darkness."

Job,25,1,And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith:—
Job,25,2,"The rule and fear are with Him, Making peace in His high places."
Job,25,3,Is their any number to His troops? And on whom ariseth not His light?

Job,25,5,"Lo—unto the moon, and it shineth not, And stars have not been pure in His eyes."
Job,25,6,"How much less man—a grub, And the son of man—a worm!"
Job,26,1,And Job answereth and saith:—
Job,26,2,"What—thou hast helped the powerless, Saved an arm not strong!"
Job,26,3,"What—thou hast given counsel to the unwise, And wise plans in abundance made known."

Job,27,7,"As the wicked is my enemy, And my withstander as the perverse."
Job,27,8,"For what is the hope of the profane, When He doth cut off? When God doth cast off his soul?"
Job,27,9,"His cry doth God hear, When distress cometh on him?"
Job,27,10,On the Mighty doth he delight himself? Call God at all times?
Job,27,11,"I shew you by the hand of God, That which is with the Mighty I hide not."

Job,29,21,"To me they have hearkened, Yea, they wait, and are silent for my counsel."
Job,29,22,"After my word they change not, And on them doth my speech drop,"
Job,29,23,"And they wait as for rain for me, And their mouth they have opened wide As for the latter rain."
Job,29,24,"I laugh unto them—they give no credence, And the light of my face cause not to fall."
Job,29,25,"I choose their way, and sit head, And I dwell as a king in a troop, When mourners he doth comfort."
Job,30,1,"And now, laughed at me, Have the younger in days than I, Whose fathers I have loathed to set With the dogs of my flock."
Job,30,2,"Also—the power of their hands, why is it to me? On them hath old age perished."
Job,30,3,"With want and with famine gloomy, Those fleeing to a dry place, Formerly a desolation and waste,"
Job,30,4,"Those cropping mallows near a shrub, And broom-roots is their food."
Job,30,5,"From the midst they are cast out, (They shout against them as a thief),"
Job,30,6,"In a frightful place of valleys to dwell, Holes of earth and clefts."
Job,30,7,"Among shrubs they do groan, Under nettles they are gathered together."
Job,30,8,"Sons of folly—even sons without name, They have been smitten from the land."
Job,30,9,"And now, their song I have been, And I am to them for a byword."
Job,30,10,"They have abominated me, They have kept far from me, And from before me have not spared to spit."
Job,30,11,"Because His cord He loosed and afflicteth me, And the bridle from before me, They have cast away."
Job,30,12,"On the right hand doth a brood arise, My feet they have cast away, And they raise up against me, Their paths of calamity."
Job,30,13,"They have broken down my path, By my calamity they profit, ‘He hath no helper.’"
Job,30,14,"As a wide breach they come, Under the desolation have rolled themselves. Job’s Prosperity Becomes Calamity"
Job,30,15,"He hath turned against me terrors, It pursueth as the wind mine abundance, And as a thick cloud, Hath my safety passed away."
Job,30,16,"And now, in me my soul poureth itself out, Seize me do days of affliction."
Job,30,17,"At night my bone hath been pierced in me, And mine eyelids do not lie down."
Job,30,18,"By the abundance of power, Is my clothing changed, As the mouth of my coat it doth gird me."
Job,30,19,"Casting me into mire, And I am become like dust and ashes."
Job,30,20,"I cry unto Thee, And Thou dost not answer me, I have stood, and Thou dost consider me."
Job,30,21,"Thou art turned to be fierce to me, With the strength of Thy hand, Thou oppressest me."
Job,30,22,"Thou dost lift me up, On the wind Thou dost cause me to ride, And Thou meltest—Thou levellest me."
Job,30,23,"For I have known To death Thou dost bring me back, And to the house appointed for all living."
Job,30,24,"Surely not against the heap Doth He send forth the hand, Though in its ruin they have safety."
Job,30,25,Did not I weep for him whose day is hard? Grieved hath my soul for the needy.

Job,30,27,"My bowels have boiled, and have not ceased, Gone before me have days of affliction."
Job,30,28,"Mourning I have gone without the sun, I have risen, in an assembly I cry."
Job,30,29,"A brother I have been to dragons, And a companion to daughters of the ostrich."
Job,30,30,"My skin hath been black upon me, And my bone hath burned from heat,"
Job,30,31,"And my harp doth become mourning, And my organ the sound of weeping."
Job,31,1,"A covenant I made for mine eyes, And what—do I attend to a virgin?"
Job,31,2,And what is the portion of God from above? And the inheritance of the Mighty from the heights?
Job,31,3,Is not calamity to the perverse? And strangeness to workers of iniquity?
Job,31,4,"Doth not He see my ways, And all my steps number?"
Job,31,5,"If I have walked with vanity, And my foot doth hasten to deceit,"
Job,31,6,"He doth weigh me in righteous balances, And God doth know my integrity."
Job,31,7,"If my step doth turn aside from the way, And after mine eyes hath my heart gone, And to my hands cleaved hath blemish,"
Job,31,8,"Let me sow—and another eat, And my products let be rooted out."
Job,31,9,"If my heart hath been enticed by woman, And by the opening of my neighbour I laid wait,"
Job,31,10,"Grind to another let my wife, And over her let others bend."
Job,31,11,"For it is a wicked thing, and a judicial iniquity;"
Job,31,12,"For a fire it is, to destruction it consumeth, And among all mine increase doth take root,"
Job,31,13,"If I despise the cause of my man-servant, And of my handmaid, In their contending with me,"
Job,31,14,"Then what do I do when God ariseth? And when He doth inspect, What do I answer Him?"
Job,31,15,"Did not He that made me in the womb make him? Yea, prepare us in the womb doth One."
Job,31,16,"If I withhold from pleasure the poor, And the eyes of the widow do consume,"
Job,31,17,"And I do eat my morsel by myself, And the orphan hath not eat of it, 18(But from my youth He grew up with me as with a father, And from the belly of my mother I am led.)"
Job,31,19,"If I see any perishing without clothing, And there is no covering to the needy,"
Job,31,20,"If his loins have not blessed me, And from the fleece of my sheep He doth not warm himself,"
Job,31,21,"If I have waved at the fatherless my hand, When I see in him the gate of my court,"
Job,31,22,"My shoulder from its blade let fall, And mine arm from the bone be broken."
Job,31,23,"For a dread unto me is calamity from God, And because of His excellency I am not able."
Job,31,24,"If I have made gold my confidence, And to the pure gold have said, ‘My trust,’"
Job,31,25,"If I rejoice because great is my wealth, And because abundance hath my hand found,"
Job,31,26,"If I see the light when it shineth, And the precious moon walking,"
Job,31,27,"And my heart is enticed in secret, And my hand doth kiss my mouth,"
Job,31,28,"It also is a judicial iniquity, For I had lied to God above."
Job,31,29,"If I rejoice at the ruin of my hater, And stirred up myself when evil found him,"
Job,31,30,"Yea, I have not suffered my mouth to sin, To ask with an oath his life."
Job,31,31,"If not—say ye, O men of my tent, ‘O that we had of his flesh, we are not satisfied.’"
Job,31,32,"In the street doth not lodge a stranger, My doors to the traveller I open."
Job,31,33,"If I have covered as Adam my transgressions, To hide in my bosom mine iniquity,"
Job,31,34,"Because I fear a great multitude, And the contempt of families doth affright me, Then I am silent, I go not out of the opening."
Job,31,35,"Who giveth to me a hearing? lo, my mark. The Mighty One doth answer me, And a bill hath mine adversary written."
Job,31,36,"If not—on my shoulder I take it up, I bind it a crown on myself."
Job,31,37,"The number of my steps I tell Him, As a leader I approach Him."
Job,31,38,"If against me my land doth cry out, And together its furrows weep,"
Job,31,39,"If its strength I consumed without money, And the life of its possessors, I have caused to breathe out,"
Job,31,40,"Instead of wheat let a thorn go forth, And instead of barley a useless weed! The words of Job are finished."
Job,32,1,"And these three men cease from answering Job, for he is righteous in his own eyes, 2and burn doth the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job hath his anger burned, because of his justifying himself more than God; 3and against his three friends hath his anger burned,"
Job,32,4,And Elihu hath waited earnestly
Job,32,5,"And Elihu seeth that there is no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger burneth."
Job,32,6,"And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answereth and saith:—Young I am in days, and ye are age Therefore I have feared, And am afraid of shewing you my opinion."
Job,32,7,"I said: Days do speak, And multitude of years teach wisdom."
Job,32,8,"Surely a spirit is in man, And the breath of the Mighty One Doth cause them to understand."
Job,32,9,"The multitude are not wise, Nor do the aged understand judgment."
Job,32,10,"Therefore I have said: Hearken to me, I do shew my opinion—even I."
Job,32,11,"Lo, I have waited for your words, I give ear unto your reasons, Till ye search out sayings."
Job,32,12,"And unto you I attend, And lo, there is no reasoner for Job, Or answerer of his sayings among you."
Job,32,13,"Lest ye say, We have found wisdom, God doth thrust him away, not man."
Job,32,14,"And he hath not set in array words for me, And with your sayings I do not answer him. 15(They have broken down, They have not answered again, They removed from themselves words."
Job,32,16,"And I have waited, but they do not speak, For they have stood still, They have not answered any more.)"
Job,32,17,"I answer, even I—my share, I shew my opinion—even I."
Job,32,18,"For I have been full of words, Distressed me hath the spirit of my breast,"
Job,32,19,"Lo, my breast is as wine not opened, Like new bottles it is broken up."
Job,32,20,"I speak, and there is refreshment to me, I open my lips and answer."
Job,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, accept the face of any, Nor unto man give flattering titles,"
Job,32,22,"For I have not known to give flattering titles, In a little doth my Maker take me away."
Job,33,1,"And yet, I pray thee, O Job, Hear my speech and to all my words give ear."
Job,33,2,"Lo, I pray thee, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath spoken in the palate."
Job,33,3,"Of the uprightness of my heart are my sayings, And knowledge have my lips clearly spoken."
Job,33,4,"The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Mighty doth quicken me."
Job,33,5,"If thou art able—answer me, Set in array before me—station thyself."
Job,33,6,"Lo, I am, according to thy word, for God, From the clay I—I also, have been formed."
Job,33,7,"Lo, my terror doth not frighten thee, And my burden on thee is not heavy."
Job,33,8,"Surely—thou hast said in mine ears, And the sounds of words I hear:"
Job,33,9,"Pure am I, without transgression, Innocent am I, and I have no iniquity."
Job,33,10,"Lo, occasions against me He doth find, He doth reckon me for an enemy to Him,"
Job,33,11,"He doth put in the stocks my feet, He doth watch all my paths.’"
Job,33,12,"Lo, in this thou hast not been righteous, I answer thee, that greater is God than man."
Job,33,13,"Wherefore against Him hast thou striven, When for all His matters He answereth not?"
Job,33,14,"For once doth God speak, and twice, (He doth not behold it.)"
Job,33,15,"In a dream—a vision of night, In the falling of deep sleep on men, In slumberings on a bed."
Job,33,16,"Then He uncovereth the ear of men, And for their instruction sealeth:"
Job,33,17,"To turn aside man from doing, And pride from man He concealeth."
Job,33,18,"He keepeth back his soul from corruption, And his life from passing away by a dart."
Job,33,19,"And he hath been reproved With pain on his bed, And the strife of his bones is enduring."
Job,33,20,"And his life hath nauseated bread, And his soul desirable food."
Job,33,21,"His flesh is consumed from being seen, And high are his bones, they were not seen!"
Job,33,22,"And draw near to the pit doth his soul, And his life to those causing death."
Job,33,23,"If there is by him a messenger, An interpreter—one of a thousand, To declare for man his uprightness:"
Job,33,24,"Then He doth favour him and saith, ‘Ransom him from going down to the pit, I have found an atonement.’"
Job,33,25,"Fresher is his flesh than a child’s, He returneth to the days of his youth."
Job,33,26,"He maketh supplication unto God, And He accepteth him. And he seeth His face with shouting, And He returneth to man His righteousness."
Job,33,27,"He looketh on men, and saith, ‘I sinned, And uprightness I have perverted, And it hath not been profitable to me."
Job,33,28,"He hath ransomed my soul From going over into the pit, And my life on the light looketh.’"
Job,33,29,"Lo, all these doth God work, Twice—thrice with man,"
Job,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, To be enlightened with the light of the living."
Job,33,31,"Attend, O Job, hearken to me, Keep silent, and I—I do speak."
Job,33,32,"If there are words—answer me, Speak, for I have a desire to justify thee."
Job,33,33,"If there are not—hearken thou to me, Keep silent, and I teach thee wisdom."
Job,34,1,And Elihu answereth and saith:
Job,34,2,"Hear, O wise men, my words, And, O knowing ones, give ear to me."
Job,34,3,"For the ear doth try words, And the palate tasteth to eat."
Job,34,4,"Judgment let us choose for ourselves, Let us know among ourselves what is good."
Job,34,5,"For Job hath said, ‘I have been righteous, And God hath turned aside my right,"
Job,34,6,Against my right do I lie? Mortal is mine arrow—without transgression.’
Job,34,7,"Who is a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water,"
Job,34,8,"And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity, So as to go with men of wickedness."
Job,34,9,"For he hath said, ‘It doth not profit a man, When he delighteth himself with God.’"
Job,34,10,"Therefore, O men of heart, hearken to me; Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from the Mighty to do perverseness:"
Job,34,11,"For the work of man he repayeth to him, And according to the path of each He doth cause him to find."
Job,34,12,"Yea, truly, God doth not do wickedly, And the Mighty doth not pervert judgment."
Job,34,13,Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath placed all the habitable world?
Job,34,14,"If He doth set on him His heart, His spirit and his breath unto Him He gathereth."
Job,34,15,"Expire doth all flesh together, And man to dust returneth."
Job,34,16,"And if there is understanding, hear this, Give ear to the voice of my words."
Job,34,17,"Yea, doth one hating justice govern? Or the Most Just dost thou condemn?"
Job,34,18,"Who hath said to a king—‘Worthless,’ Unto princes—‘Wicked?’"
Job,34,19,"That hath not accepted the person of princes, Nor hath known the rich before the poor, For a work of His hands are all of them."
Job,34,20,"In a moment they die, and at midnight Shake do people, and they pass away, And they remove the mighty without hand."
Job,34,21,"For His eyes are on the ways of each, And all his steps He doth see."
Job,34,22,"There is no darkness nor death-shade, For workers of iniquity to be hidden there;"
Job,34,23,"For He doth not suffer man any more, To go unto God in judgment,"
Job,34,24,He breaketh the mighty—no searching! And He appointeth others in their stead.
Job,34,25,"Therefore He knoweth their works, And He hath overturned by night, And they are bruised."
Job,34,26,"As wicked He hath stricken them, In the place of beholders."
Job,34,27,"Because that against right They have turned aside from after Him, And none of His ways have considered wisely,"
Job,34,28,"To cause to come in unto Him The cry of the poor, And the cry of the afflicted He heareth."
Job,34,29,"And He giveth rest, and who maketh wrong? And hideth the face, and who beholdeth it? And in reference to a nation and to a man, It is the same."
Job,34,30,"From the reigning of a profane man, From the snares of a people;"
Job,34,31,"For unto God hath any said: ‘I have taken away, I do not corruptly,"
Job,34,32,"Besides that which I see, shew Thou me, If iniquity I have done—I do not add?’"
Job,34,33,"By thee doth He recompense, That thou hast refused—That thou dost choose, and not I? And what thou hast known, speak."
Job,34,34,"Let men of heart say to me, And a wise man is hearkening to me."
Job,34,35,"Job—not with knowledge doth he speak, And his words are not with wisdom."
Job,34,36,"My Father! let Job be tried—unto victory, Because of answers for men of iniquity,"
Job,34,37,"For he doth add to his sin, Transgression among us he vomiteth, And multiplieth his sayings to God."
Job,35,1,And Elihu answereth and saith:—
Job,35,2,This hast thou reckoned for judgment: Thou hast said—‘My righteousness is more than God’s?’
Job,35,3,"For thou sayest, ‘What doth it profit Thee! What do I profit from my sin?’"
Job,35,4,"I return thee words, and thy friends with thee,"
Job,35,5,"Behold attentively the heavens—and see, And behold the clouds, They have been higher than thou."
Job,35,6,"If thou hast sinned, what dost thou against Him? And thy transgressions have been multiplied, What dost thou to Him?"
Job,35,7,"If thou hast been righteous, What dost thou give to Him? Or what from thy hand doth He receive?"
Job,35,8,"For a man like thyself is thy wickedness, And for a son of man thy righteousness."
Job,35,9,"Because of the multitude of oppressions They cause to cry out, They cry because of the arm of the mighty."
Job,35,10,"And none said, ‘Where is God my maker? Giving songs in the night,"
Job,35,11,"Teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, Yea, than the fowl of the heavens He maketh us wiser.’"
Job,35,12,"There they cry, and He doth not answer, Because of the pride of evil doers."
Job,35,13,"Surely vanity God doth not hear, And the Mighty doth not behold it."
Job,35,14,"Yea, though thou sayest thou dost not behold Him, Judgment is before Him, and stay for Him."
Job,35,15,"And, now, because there is not, He hath appointed His anger, And He hath not known in great extremity."
Job,35,16,"And Job with vanity doth open his mouth, Without knowledge words he multiplieth."
Job,36,1,And Elihu addeth and saith:—
Job,36,2,"Honour me a little, and I shew thee, That yet for God are words."
Job,36,3,"I lift up my knowledge from afar, And to my Maker I ascribe righteousness."
Job,36,4,"For, truly, my words are not false, The perfect in knowledge is with thee."
Job,36,5,"Lo, God is mighty, and despiseth not, Mighty in power and heart."
Job,36,6,"He reviveth not the wicked, And the judgment of the poor appointeth;"
Job,36,7,"He withdraweth not from the righteous His eyes, And from kings on the throne, And causeth them to sit for ever, and they are high,"
Job,36,8,"And if prisoners in fetters They are captured with cords of affliction,"
Job,36,9,"Then He declareth to them their work, And their transgressions, Because they have become mighty,"
Job,36,10,"And He uncovereth their ear for instruction, And saith that they turn back from iniquity."
Job,36,11,"If they do hear and serve, They complete their days in good, And their years in pleasantness."
Job,36,12,"And if they do not hearken, By the dart they pass away, And expire without knowledge."
Job,36,13,"And the profane in heart set the face, They cry not when He hath bound them."
Job,36,14,"Their soul dieth in youth, And their life among the defiled."
Job,36,15,"He draweth out the afflicted in his affliction, And uncovereth in oppression their ear."
Job,36,16,"And also He moved thee from a strait place, To a broad place—no straitness under it, And the sitting beyond of thy table Hath been full of fatness."
Job,36,17,"And the judgment of the wicked thou hast fulfilled, Judgment and justice are upheld—because of fury,"
Job,36,18,"Lest He move thee with a stroke, And the abundance of an atonement turn thee not aside."
Job,36,19,"Doth He value thy riches? He hath gold, and all the forces of power."
Job,36,20,"Desire not the night, For the going up of peoples in their stead."
Job,36,21,"Take heed—do not turn unto iniquity, For on this thou hast fixed Rather than on affliction."
Job,36,22,"Lo, God doth sit on high by His power, Who is like Him—a teacher?"
Job,36,23,"Who hath appointed unto Him his way? And who said, ‘Thou hast done iniquity?’"
Job,36,24,Remember that thou magnify His work That men have beheld.
Job,36,25,"All men have looked on it, Man looketh attentively from afar."
Job,36,26,"Lo, God is high, And we know not the number of His years, Yea, there is no searching."
Job,36,27,"When He doth diminish droppings of the waters, They refine rain according to its vapour,"
Job,36,28,"Which clouds do drop, They distil on man abundantly."
Job,36,29,"Yea, doth any understand The spreadings out of a cloud? The noises of His tabernacle?"
Job,36,30,"Lo, He hath spread over it His light, And the roots of the sea He hath covered,"
Job,36,31,"For by them He doth judge peoples, He giveth food in abundance."
Job,36,32,"By two palms He hath covered the light, And layeth a charge over it in meeting,"
Job,36,33,"He sheweth by it to his friend substance, Anger against perversity."
Job,37,1,"Also, at this my heart trembleth, And it moveth from its place."
Job,37,2,"Hearken diligently to the trembling of His voice, Yea, the sound from His mouth goeth forth."
Job,37,3,"Under the whole heavens He directeth it, And its light is over the skirts of the earth."
Job,37,4,"After it roar doth a voice—He thundereth with the voice of His excellency, And He doth not hold them back, When His voice is heard."
Job,37,5,"God thundereth with His voice wonderfully, Doing great things and we know not."
Job,37,6,"For to snow He saith, ‘Be on the earth.’ And the small rain and great rain of His power."
Job,37,7,"Into the hand of every man he sealeth, For the knowledge by all men of His work."
Job,37,8,"And enter doth the beast into covert, And in its habitations it doth continue."
Job,37,9,"From the inner chamber cometh a hurricane, And from scatterings winds—cold,"
Job,37,10,"From the breath of God is frost given, And the breadth of waters is straitened,"
Job,37,11,"Yea, by filling He doth press out a cloud, Scatter a cloud doth His light."
Job,37,12,"And it is turning itself round by His counsels, For their doing all He commandeth them, On the face of the habitable earth."
Job,37,13,"Whether for a rod, or for His land, Or for kindness—He doth cause it to come."
Job,37,14,"Hear this, O Job, Stand and consider the wonders of God."
Job,37,15,"Dost thou know when God doth place them, And caused to shine the light of His cloud?"
Job,37,16,Dost thou know the balancings of a cloud? The wonders of the Perfect in knowledge?
Job,37,17,"How thy garments are warm, In the quieting of the earth from the south?"
Job,37,18,Thou hast made an expanse with Him For the clouds—strong as a hard mirror!
Job,37,19,"Let us know what we say to Him, We set not in array because of darkness."
Job,37,20,"Is it declared to Him that I speak? If a man hath spoken, surely he is swallowed up."
Job,37,21,"And now, they have not seen the light, Bright it is in the clouds, And the wind hath passed by and cleanseth them."
Job,37,22,"From the golden north it cometh, Beside God is fearful honour."
Job,37,23,"The Mighty! we have not found Him out, High in power and judgment, He doth not answer! And abundant in righteousness,"
Job,37,24,"Therefore do men fear Him, He seeth not any of the wise of heart."
Job,38,1,"And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith:—"
Job,38,2,"Who is this—darkening counsel, By words without knowledge?"
Job,38,3,"Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, And I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know."
Job,38,4,"Where wast thou when I founded earth? Declare, if thou hast known understanding."
Job,38,5,Who placed its measures—if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched out upon it a line?
Job,38,6,On what have its sockets been sunk? Or who hath cast its corner-stone?
Job,38,7,"In the singing together of stars of morning, And all sons of God shout for joy,"
Job,38,8,"And He shutteth up with doors the sea, In its coming forth, from the womb it goeth out."
Job,38,9,"In My making a cloud its clothing, And thick darkness its swaddling band,"
Job,38,10,"And I measure over it My statute, And place bar and doors,"
Job,38,11,"And say, ‘Hitherto come thou, and add not, And a command is placed On the pride of thy billows.’"
Job,38,12,Hast thou commanded morning since thy days? Causest thou the dawn to know its place?
Job,38,13,"To take hold on the skirts of the earth, And the wicked are shaken out of it,"
Job,38,14,It turneth itself as clay of a seal And they station themselves as clothed.
Job,38,15,"And withheld from the wicked is their light, And the arm lifted up is broken."
Job,38,16,Hast thou come in to springs of the sea? And in searching the deep Hast thou walked up and down?
Job,38,17,Revealed to thee were the gates of death? And the gates of death-shade dost thou see?
Job,38,18,"Thou hast understanding, Even unto the broad places of earth! Declare—if thou hast known it all."
Job,38,19,"Where is this—the way light dwelleth? And darkness, where is this—its place?"
Job,38,20,"That thou dost take it unto its boundary, And that thou dost understand The paths of its house."
Job,38,21,Thou hast known—for then thou art born And the number of thy days are many!
Job,38,22,"Hast thou come in unto the treasure of snow? Yea, the treasures of hail dost thou see?"
Job,38,23,"That I have kept back for a time of distress, For a day of conflict and battle."
Job,38,24,"Where is this, the way light is apportioned? It scattereth an east wind over the earth."
Job,38,25,Who hath divided for the flood a conduit? And a way for the lightning of the voices?
Job,38,26,"To cause it to rain on a land—no man, A wilderness—no man in it."
Job,38,27,"To satisfy a desolate and waste place, And to cause to shoot up The produce of the tender grass?"
Job,38,28,Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
Job,38,29,"From whose belly came forth the ice? And the hoar-frost of the heavens, Who hath begotten it?"
Job,38,30,"As a stone waters are hidden, And the face of the deep is captured."
Job,38,31,Dost thou bind sweet influences of Kimah? Or the attractions of Kesil dost thou open?
Job,38,32,Dost thou bring out Mazzaroth in its season? And Aysh for her sons dost thou comfort?
Job,38,33,Hast thou known the statutes of heaven? Or dost thou appoint Its dominion in the earth?
Job,38,34,"Dost thou lift up to the cloud thy voice, And abundance of water doth cover thee?"
Job,38,35,"Dost thou send out lightnings, and they go And say unto thee, ‘Behold us?’"

Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel to his house hath gone, and to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, he hath made the thing known, 18and to seek mercies from before the God of the heavens concerning this secret, that they destroy not Daniel and his companions with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."

Daniel,2,32,"This image! its head is of good gold, its breasts and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass; 33its legs of iron, its feet,"
Daniel,2,34,"Thou wast looking till that a stone hath been cut out without hands, and it hath smitten the image on its feet, that are of iron and of clay, and it hath broken them small; 35then broken small together have been the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, and they have been as chaff from the summer threshing-floor, and carried them away hath the wind, and no place hath been found for them: and the stone that smote the image hath become a great mountain, and hath filled all the land."
Daniel,2,36,"This is the dream, and its interpretation we do tell before the king. 37‘Thou, O king, art a king of kings, for the God of the heavens a kingdom, strength, and might, and glory, hath given to thee; 38and whithersoever sons of men are dwelling, the beast of the field, and the fowl of the heavens, He hath given into thy hand, and hath caused thee to rule over them all; thou art this head of gold."

Daniel,5,7,"Call doth the king mightily, to bring up the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. Answered hath the king, and said to the wise men of Babylon, that, ‘Any man who doth read this writing, and its interpretation doth shew me, purple he putteth on, and a bracelet of gold is on his neck, and third in the kingdom he doth"
Daniel,5,8,"Then coming up are all the wise men of the king, and they are not able to read the writing, and the interpretation to make known to the king; 9then the king Belshazzar is greatly troubled, and his countenance is changing in him, and his great men are perplexed."
Daniel,5,10,"The queen, on account of the words of the king and his great men, to the banquet-house hath come up. Answered hath the queen, and said, ‘O king, to the ages live; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor thy countenance be changed: 11there is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and, in the days of thy father, light, and understanding, and wisdom—as the wisdom of the gods—was found in him; and king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, chief of the scribes, enchanters, Chaldeans, soothsayers, established him—thy father, O king— 12because that an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of enigmas, and loosing of knots was found in him, in Daniel, whose name the king made Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and the interpretation he doth show.’ Daniel Interprets the Handwriting"
Daniel,5,13,"Then Daniel hath been caused to come up before the king; answered hath the king, and said to Daniel, ‘Thou art that Daniel who art of the sons of the Removed of Judah, whom the king my father"
Daniel,5,14,"And I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and light, and understanding, and excellent wisdom have been found in thee. 15‘And now, caused to come up before me have been the wise men, the enchanters, that this writing they may read, and its interpretation to cause me to know: and they are not able to shew the interpretation of the thing: 16and I—I have heard of thee, that thou art able to give interpretations, and to loose knots: now, lo— thou art able to read the writing, and its interpretation to cause me to know—purple thou dost put on, and a bracelet of gold is on thy neck, and third in the kingdom thou dost rule.’"
Daniel,5,17,"Then hath Daniel answered and said before the king, ‘Thy gifts be to thyself, and thy fee to another give; nevertheless, the writing I do read to the king, and the interpretation I cause him to know; 18thou, O king, God Most High, a kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and honour, gave to Nebuchadnezzar thy father: 19and because of the greatness that He gave to him, all peoples, nations, and languages were trembling and fearing before him: whom he willed he was slaying, and whom he willed he was keeping alive, and whom he willed he was raising up, and whom he willed he was making low; 20and when his heart was high, and his spirit was strong to act proudly, he hath been caused to come down from the throne of his kingdom, and his glory they have caused to pass away from him, 21and from the sons of men he is driven, and his heart with the beasts hath been like, and with the wild asses is his dwelling; the herb like oxen they cause him to eat, and by the dew of the heavens is his body wet, till that he hath known that God Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and whom He willeth He raiseth up over it. 22‘And thou, his son, Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though all this thou hast known; 23and against the Lord of the heavens thou hast lifted up thyself; and the vessels of His house they have brought in before thee, and thou, and thy great men, thy wives, and thy concubines, are drinking wine with them, and gods of silver, and of gold, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone, that are not seeing, nor hearing, nor knowing, thou hast praised: and the God in whose hand is thy breath, and all thy ways, Him thou hast not honoured. 24‘Then from before Him sent is the extremity of the hand, and the writing is noted down;"
Daniel,5,26,"This is the interpretation of the thing: Numbered—God hath numbered thy kingdom, and hath finished it."
Daniel,5,27,"Weighed—Thou art weighed in the balances, and hast been found lacking."
Daniel,5,28,"Divided—Divided is thy kingdom, and it hath been given to the Medes and Persians.’"
Daniel,5,29,"Then hath Belshazzar said, and they have clothed Daniel with purple, and a bracelet of gold is on his neck, and they have proclaimed concerning him that he is the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,"In that night Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans is slain, 31and Darius the Mede hath received the kingdom, when a son of sixty and two years."
Daniel,6,1,"It hath been good before Darius, and he hath established over the kingdom satraps—a hundred and twenty—that they may be throughout the whole kingdom, 2and higher than they three presidents, of"
Daniel,6,3,"Then this Daniel hath been overseer over the presidents and satraps, because that an excellent spirit is in"
Daniel,6,4,"Then the presidents and satraps have been seeking to find a cause of complaint against Daniel concerning the kingdom, and any cause of complaint and corruption they are not able to find, because that he is faithful, and any"
Daniel,6,5,"Then these men are saying, ‘We do not find against this Daniel any cause of complaint, except we have found it against him in the law of his God.’"
Daniel,6,6,"Then these presidents and satraps have assembled near the king, and thus they are saying to him:"
Daniel,6,7,"Taken counsel have all the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects, and the satraps, the counsellors, and the governors, to establish a royal statute, and to strengthen an interdict, that any who seeketh a petition from any god and man until thirty days, save of thee, O king,"
Daniel,6,8,"Now, O king, thou dost establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it"
Daniel,6,9,Therefore king Darius hath signed the writing and interdict. Daniel in the Lions’ Den
Daniel,6,10,"And Daniel, when he hath known that the writing is signed, hath gone up to his house, and the window being opened for him, in his upper chamber, over-against Jerusalem, three times in a day he is kneeling on his knees, and praying, and confessing before his God, because that he was doing it"
Daniel,6,11,"Then these men have assembled, and found Daniel praying and entreating grace before his God; 12then they have come near, yea, they are saying before the king concerning the king’s interdict: ‘Hast thou not signed an interdict, that any man who seeketh from any god and man until thirty days, save of thee, O king, is cast into a den of lions?’ Answered hath the king, and said, ‘The"
Daniel,6,13,"Then they have answered, yea, they are saying before the king, that, ‘Daniel, who is of the sons of the Removed of Judah, hath not placed on thee, O king, any regard, nor on the interdict that thou hast signed, and three times in a day he is seeking his petition.’"
Daniel,6,14,"Then the king, when he hath heard the matter, is greatly displeased at himself, and on Daniel he hath set the heart to deliver him, and till the going up of the sun he was arranging to deliver him."
Daniel,6,15,"Then these men have assembled near the king, and are saying to the king, ‘know, O king, that the law of Media and Persia is: That any interdict and statute that the king doth establish is not to be changed.’"
Daniel,6,16,"Then the king hath said, and they have brought Daniel, and have cast him into a den of lions. The king hath answered and said to Daniel, ‘Thy God, whom thou art serving continually, Himself doth"
Daniel,6,17,"And a stone hath been brought and placed at the mouth of the den, and the king hath sealed it with his signet, and with the signet of his great men, that the purpose be not changed"
Daniel,6,18,"Then hath the king gone to his palace, and he hath passed the night fasting, and dahavan have not been brought up before him, and his sleep hath fled from off him."
Daniel,6,19,"Then doth the king rise in the early morning, at the light, and in haste to the den of lions he hath gone; 20and at his coming near to the den, to Daniel, with a grieved voice, he crieth. The king hath answered and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, thy God, whom thou art serving"
Daniel,6,21,"Then Daniel hath spoken with the king: ‘O king, to the ages live: 22my God hath sent His messenger, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not injured me: because that before Him purity hath been found in me; and also before thee, O king,"
Daniel,6,23,"Then was the king very glad for him, and he hath commanded Daniel to be taken up out of the den, and Daniel hath been taken up out of the den, and no injury hath been found in him, because he hath believed in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"And the king hath said, and they have brought those men who had accused Daniel, and to the den of lions they have cast them, they, their sons, and their wives; and they have not come to the lower part of the den till that the lions have power over them, and all their bones they have broken small. Darius Honors God"
Daniel,6,25,"Then Darius the king hath written to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who are dwelling in all the land: ‘Your peace be great!"
Daniel,6,26,"From before me is made a decree, that in every dominion of my kingdom they are trembling and fearing before the God of Daniel, for He is the living God, and abiding to the ages, and His kingdom that which is not destroyed, and His dominion is unto the end."
Daniel,6,27,"A deliverer, and rescuer, and doer of signs and wonders in the heavens and in earth is He who hath delivered Daniel from the paw of the lions.’"
Daniel,6,28,"And this Daniel hath prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian."
Daniel,7,1,"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel hath seen a dream, and the visions of his head"
Daniel,7,2,"Answered hath Daniel and said, ‘I was seeing in my vision by night, and lo, the four winds of the heavens are coming forth"
Daniel,7,4,"The first is like a lion, and it hath an eagle’s wings. I was seeing till that its wings have been plucked, and it hath been lifted up from the earth, and on feet as a man it hath been caused to stand, and a heart"
Daniel,7,5,"And lo, another beast, a second, like to a bear, and to the same authority it hath been raised, and three ribs are in its mouth, between its teeth, and thus they are saying to it, Rise, consume much flesh. 6‘After this I was seeing, and lo, another like a leopard, and it hath four wings of"
Daniel,7,7,"After this I was seeing in the visions of the night, and lo, a fourth beast, terrible and fearful, and exceedingly strong; and it hath iron teeth very great, it hath consumed, yea, it doth break small, and the remnant with its feet it"
Daniel,7,8,"I was considering about the horns, and lo, another horn, a little one, hath come up between them, and three of the first horns have been eradicated from before it, and lo, eyes as the eyes of man are in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things. Daniel’s Vision of the Ancient of Days"
Daniel,7,9,"I was seeing till that thrones have been thrown down, and the Ancient of Days is seated, His garment as snow is white, and the hair of his head is as pure wool, His throne flames of fire, its wheels burning fire."
Daniel,7,10,"A flood of fire is proceeding and coming forth from before Him, a thousand thousands do serve Him, and a myriad of myriads before Him do rise up, the Judge is seated, and the books have been opened. 11‘I was seeing, then, because of the voice of the great words that the horn is speaking, I was seeing till that the beast is slain, and his body hath been destroyed, and given to the burning fire; 12and the rest of the beasts have caused their dominion to pass away, and a prolongation in life is given to them, till a season and a time. Daniel’s Vision of the Son of Man"
Daniel,7,13,"I was seeing in the visions of the night, and lo, with the clouds of the heavens as a son of man was one coming, and unto the Ancient of Days he hath come, and before Him they have brought him near."
Daniel,7,14,"And to him is given dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, and all peoples, nations, and languages do serve him, his dominion is a dominion age-during, that passeth not away, and his kingdom that which is not destroyed. Daniel’s Visions Interpreted 15‘Pierced hath been my spirit—I, Daniel—in the midst of the sheath, and the visions of my head trouble"
Daniel,7,16,"I have drawn near unto one of those standing, and the certainty I seek from him of all this; and"
Daniel,7,17,"These great beasts, that are four, are four kings, they rise up from the earth; 18and receive the kingdom do the saints of the Most High, and they strengthen the kingdom unto the age, even unto the age of the ages. 19‘Then I wished for certainty concerning the fourth beast, that was diverse from them all, fearful exceedingly; its teeth of iron, and its nails of brass, it hath devoured, it doth break small, and the remnant with its feet it hath trampled; 20and concerning the ten horns that are in its heads, and of the other that came up, and before which three have fallen, even of that horn that hath eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and whose appearance is great above its companions. 21‘I was seeing, and this horn is making war with the saints, and hath prevailed over them, 22till that the Ancient of Days hath come, and judgment is given to the saints of the Most High, and the time hath come, and the saints have strengthened the kingdom. 23‘Thus he said: The fourth beast is the fourth kingdom in the earth, that is diverse from all kingdoms,"
Daniel,7,24,"And the ten horns out of the kingdom are ten kings, they rise, and another doth rise after them, and it is diverse from the former, and three kings it humbleth; 25and words as an adversary of the Most High it doth speak, and the saints of the Most High it doth wear out, and it hopeth to change seasons and law; and they are given into its hand, till a time, and times, and a division of a time. 26‘And the Judge is seated, and its dominion they cause to pass away, to cut off, and to destroy—unto the end; 27and the kingdom, and the dominion, even the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heavens, is given to the people— the saints of the Most High, His kingdom is a kingdom age-during, and all dominions do serve and obey Him."
Daniel,7,28,"Hitherto is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, greatly do my thoughts trouble me, and my countenance is changed on me, and the matter in my heart I have kept."
Daniel,8,2,"And I see in a vision, and it cometh to pass, in my seeing, and I am in Shushan the palace that is in Elam the province, and I see in a vision, and I"
Daniel,8,3,"And I lift up mine eyes, and look, and lo, a certain ram is standing before the stream, and it hath two horns, and the two horns are high; and the one is higher than the"
Daniel,8,4,"I have seen the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward, and no living creatures do stand before it, and there is none delivering out of its hand, and it hath done according to its pleasure, and hath exerted itself."
Daniel,8,5,"And I have been considering, and lo, a young he-goat hath come from the west, over the face of the whole earth, whom none is touching in the earth; as to the young he-goat, a conspicuous horn is"
Daniel,8,6,"And it cometh unto the ram possessing the two horns, that I had seen standing"
Daniel,8,7,"And I have seen it coming near the ram, and it becometh embittered at it, and smiteth the ram, and breaketh its two horns, and there hath been no power in the ram to stand before it, and it casteth it to the earth, and trampleth it down, and there hath been no deliverer to the ram out of its power. 8‘And the young he-goat hath exerted itself very much, and when it is strong, broken hath been the great horn; and come up doth a vision of four in its place, at the four winds of the heavens."
Daniel,8,9,"And from the one of them come forth hath a little horn, and it exerteth itself greatly toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauteous land; 10yea, it exerteth unto the host of the heavens,"
Daniel,8,11,"And unto the prince of the host it exerteth itself, and by it taken away hath been the continual sacrifice, and"
Daniel,8,12,"And the host is given up, with the continual sacrifice, through"
Daniel,8,13,"And I hear a certain holy one speaking, and a certain holy one saith to the wonderful numberer who is speaking: Till when is the vision of the continual sacrifice, and of the transgression, an astonishment,"
Daniel,8,14,"And he saith unto me, Till evening—morning two thousand and three hundred, then is the holy place declared right. Gabriel Interprets Daniel’s Vision"
Daniel,8,15,"And it cometh to pass in my seeing—I, Daniel—the vision, that I require understanding, and lo,"
Daniel,8,16,"And I hear a voice of man between the banks of Ulai, and he calleth and saith: Gabriel, cause this one to understand the appearance."
Daniel,8,17,"And he cometh in near my station, and at his coming in I have been afraid, and I fall on my face, and he saith unto me: Understand, son of man, for at the time of the end is the vision."
Daniel,8,18,"And in his speaking with me, I have been in a trance on my face, on the earth; and he cometh against me, and causeth me to stand on my station, 19and saith: Lo, I—I am causing thee to know that which is in the latter end of the indignation; for, at the appointed time is the end."
Daniel,8,20,"The ram that thou hast seen possessing two horns, are the kings of Media and Persia."
Daniel,8,21,"And the young he-goat, the hairy one, is the king of Javan; and the great horn that is between its eyes is the first king; 22and that being broken, stand up do four in its place, four kingdoms from the nation do stand up, and not in its power. 23‘And in the latter end of their kingdom, about the perfecting of the transgressors, stand up doth a king, fierce of face, and understanding hidden things; 24and his power hath been mighty, and not by his own power; and wonderful things he destroyeth, and he hath prospered, and wrought, and destroyed mighty ones, and the people of the Holy Ones. 25‘And by his understanding he hath also caused deceit to prosper in his hand, and in his heart he exerteth himself, and by ease he destroyeth many; and against the prince of princes he standeth—and without hand he is broken."
Daniel,8,26,"And the appearance of the evening and of the morning, that is told, is true; and thou, hide thou the vision, for it is after many days.’"
Daniel,8,27,"And I, Daniel, have been, yea, I became sick for days, and I rise, and do the king’s work, and am astonished at the appearance, and there is none understanding."
Daniel,9,1,"In the first year of Darius, son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who hath been made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans, 2in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, have understood by books the number of the years, (in that a word of Jehovah hath been unto Jeremiah the prophet,) concerning the fulfilling of the wastes of Jerusalem—seventy years; 3and I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek"
Daniel,9,4,"And I pray to Jehovah my God, and confess, and say: ‘I beseech Thee, O Lord God, the great and the fearful, keeping the covenant and the kindness to those loving Him, and to those keeping His commands; 5we have sinned, and done perversely, and done wickedly, and rebelled, to turn aside from Thy commands, and from Thy judgments: 6and we have not hearkened unto Thy servants, the prophets, who have spoken in Thy name unto our kings, our heads, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land."
Daniel,9,7,"To Thee, O Lord, is the righteousness, and to us the shame of face, as at this day, to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near, and who are far off, in all"
Daniel,9,8,"O Lord, to us is the shame of face, to our kings, to our heads, and to our fathers, in that we have sinned"
Daniel,9,9,"To the Lord our God are the mercies and the forgivenesses, for we have rebelled against Him, 10and have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in His laws, that He hath set before us by the hand of His servants the prophets; 11and all Israel have transgressed Thy law, to turn aside so as not to hearken to Thy voice; and poured on us is the execration, and the oath, that is written in the law of Moses, servant of God, because we have sinned against Him. 12‘And He confirmeth His words that He hath spoken against us, and against our judges who have judged us, to bring in upon us great evil, in that it hath not been done under the whole heavens as it hath been done in Jerusalem, 13as it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil hath come upon us, and we have not appeased the face of Jehovah our God to turn back from our iniquities, and to act wisely in Thy truth."
Daniel,9,14,"And Jehovah doth watch for the evil, and bringeth it upon us, for righteous is Jehovah our God concerning all His works that He hath done, and we have not hearkened to His voice."
Daniel,9,15,"And now, O Lord our God, who hast brought forth Thy people from the land of Egypt by a strong"
Daniel,9,16,"O Lord, according to all Thy righteous acts, let turn back, I pray Thee, Thine anger and Thy fury from Thy city Jerusalem, Thy holy mount, for by our sins, and by the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people are for a reproach to all our neighbours; 17and now, hearken, O our God, unto the prayer of Thy servant, and unto his supplication, and cause Thy face to shine on Thy sanctuary that is desolate,"

Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a thing is revealed to Daniel, whose name is called Belteshazzar, and the thing is true, and the warfare is great: and he hath understood the thing, and hath understanding about the appearance. 2‘In those days, I, Daniel, have been mourning three weeks of days; 3desirable bread I have not eaten, and flesh and wine hath not come in unto my mouth, and I have not anointed myself at all, till the"
Daniel,10,4,"And in the twenty and fourth day of the first month, I have been by the side of the great river, that is Hiddekel: 5and I lift up mine eyes, and look, and lo, a certain one clothed in linen, and his loins girt with pure gold of Uphaz, 6and his body as a beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet as the aspect of bright brass, and the voice of his words as the voice of a multitude. 7‘And I have seen—I, Daniel, by myself—the appearance: and the men who have been with me have not seen the appearance, but a great trembling hath fallen on them, and they flee to be hidden; 8and I have been left by myself, and I see this great appearance, and there hath been no power left in me, and my honour hath been turned"

Daniel,10,12,"And he saith unto me: Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that thou didst give thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words have been heard, and I have come because of thy words. 13‘And the head of the kingdom of Persia is standing over-against me twenty and one days, and lo, Michael, first of the chief heads, hath come in to help me, and I have remained there near the kings of Persia; 14and I have come to cause thee to understand that which doth happen to thy people in the latter end of the days, for yet the vision is after days. 15‘And when he speaketh with me about these things, I have set my face toward the earth, and have been silent; 16and lo, as the manner of the sons of men, he is striking against my lips, and I open my mouth, and I speak, and say unto him who is standing over-against me: My lord, by the appearance"

Daniel,11,24,"Peaceably even into the fertile places of the province He cometh, and he hath done that which his fathers did not, nor his fathers’ fathers; prey, and spoil, and substance, to them he scattereth, and against fenced places he deviseth his devices, even for a time. 25‘And he stirreth up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great force, and the king of the south stirreth himself up to battle with a very great and mighty force, and standeth not, for they devise devices against him, 26and those eating his portion of food destroy him, and his force overfloweth, and fallen have many wounded."
Daniel,11,27,"And both of the kings’ hearts are to do evil, and at one table they speak lies, and it doth not prosper,"
Daniel,11,28,"And he turneth back to his land with great substance, and his heart is against the holy covenant, and he hath wrought, and turned back to his land."
Daniel,11,29,"At the appointed time he turneth back, and hath come against the south, and it is not as the former, and as the latter."
Daniel,11,30,"And ships of Chittim have come in against him, and he hath been pained, and hath turned back, and hath been insolent toward the holy covenant, and hath wrought, and turned back, and he"

Daniel,11,34,"And in their stumbling, they are helped—a little help, and joined to them have"
Daniel,11,35,"And some of the teachers do stumble for refining by them, and for purifying, and for making white—till the end of the time, for it is yet for a time appointed.

Daniel,11,38,"And to the god of strongholds, on his station, he giveth honour; yea, to a god whom his fathers knew not he giveth honour, with gold, and with silver, and with precious"
Daniel,11,39,"And he hath dealt in the fortresses of the strongholds with a strange god whom he hath acknowledged; he multiplieth honour, and hath caused them to rule over many, and the ground he apportioneth at a price. 40‘And at the time of the end, push himself forward with him doth a king of the south, and storm against him doth a king of the north, with chariot, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he hath come in to the lands, and hath overflowed, and passed over, 41and hath come into the desirable land, and many do stumble, and these escape from his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the sons of Ammon. 42‘And he sendeth forth his hand upon the lands, and the land of Egypt is not for an escape; 43and he hath ruled over treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt, and Lubim and Cushim are at his steps. 44‘And reports trouble him out of the east and out of the north, and he hath gone forth in great fury to destroy, and to devote many to destruction; 45and he planteth the tents of his palace between the seas and the holy desirable mountain, and hath come unto his end, and there is no helper to him."
Daniel,12,3,"And those teaching do shine as the brightness of the expanse,"
Daniel,12,4,"And thou, O Daniel, hide the things, and seal the book till the time of the end, many do go to and fro, and knowledge is multiplied.’"
Daniel,12,5,"And I have looked—I, Daniel—and lo, two others are standing, one here at the edge of the flood, and one there at the edge of the flood, 6and he saith to the one clothed in linen, who is upon the waters"
Daniel,12,7,"And I hear the one clothed in linen, who is upon the waters of the flood, and he doth lift up his right hand and his left unto the heavens, and sweareth by Him who is living to the age, that, ‘After a time, times, and a half, and at the completion of the"

Daniel,12,12,"O the blessedness of him who is waiting earnestly, and doth come to the days, a thousand,"
Daniel,12,13,"And thou, go on to the end, then thou dost rest, and dost stand in thy lot at the end of the days.’"
Hosea,1,1,"A word of Jehovah that hath been unto Hosea, son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel:"
Hosea,1,2,"The commencement of Jehovah’s speaking by Hosea. And Jehovah saith unto Hosea, ‘Go, take to thee a woman of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms, for utterly go a-whoring doth the land from"
Hosea,1,3,"And he goeth and taketh Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceiveth and beareth to him a son; 4and Jehovah saith unto him, ‘Call his name Jezreel, for yet a little, and I have charged the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and have caused to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel; 5and it hath come to pass in that day that I have broken the bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.’"
Hosea,1,6,"And she conceiveth again, and beareth a daughter, and He saith to him, ‘Call her name Lo-Ruhamah, for I add no more to pity the house of Israel, for I do utterly take them away; 7and the house of Judah I pity, and have saved them by Jehovah their God, and do not save them by bow, and by sword, and by battle, by horses, and by horsemen.’"
Hosea,1,8,"And she weaneth Lo-Ruhamah, and conceiveth, and beareth a son; 9and He saith, ‘Call his name Lo- Ammi, for ye are not My people, and I am not for you; 10and the number of the sons of Israel hath been as the sand of the sea, that is not measured nor numbered, and it hath come to pass in the place where it is said to them, Ye are not My people, it is said to them, Sons of the Living God; 11and gathered have been the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel together, and they have appointed to themselves one head, and have gone up from the land, for great is the day of Jezreel."
Hosea,2,2,"Plead ye with your mother—plead, (For she is not My wife, and I am not her husband,) And she turneth her whoredoms from before her, And her adulteries from between her breasts,"
Hosea,2,3,"Lest I strip her naked. And have set her up as in the day of her birth, And have made her as a wilderness, And have set her as a dry land, And have put her to death with thirst."
Hosea,2,4,"And her sons I do not pity, For sons of whoredoms are they,"
Hosea,2,5,"For gone a-whoring hath their mother, Acted shamefully hath their conceiver, For she hath said, I go after my lovers, Those giving my bread and my water, My wool and my flax, my oil and my drink."
Hosea,2,6,"Therefore, lo, I am hedging up thy way with thorns, And I have made for her a wall, And her paths she doth not find."
Hosea,2,7,"And she hath pursued her lovers, And she doth not overtake them, And hath sought them, and doth not find, And she hath said: I go, and I turn back unto My first husband, For—better to me then than now."
Hosea,2,8,"And she knew not that I had given to her, The corn, and the new wine, and the oil. Yea, silver I did multiply to her, And the gold they prepared for Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"Therefore do I turn back, And I have taken My corn in its season, And My new wine in its appointed time, And I have taken away My wool and My flax, covering her nakedness."
Hosea,2,10,"And now do I reveal her dishonour before the eyes of her lovers, And none doth deliver her out of My hand."
Hosea,2,11,"And I have caused to cease all her joy, Her festival, her new moon, and her sabbath, Even all her appointed times,"
Hosea,2,12,"And made desolate her vine and her fig-tree, Of which she said, A gift they are to me, That my lovers have given to me, And I have made them for a forest, And consumed them hath a beast of the field."
Hosea,2,13,"And I have charged on her the days of the Baalim, To whom she maketh perfume, And putteth on her ring and her ornament, And goeth after her lovers, And Me forgat—an affirmation of Jehovah. God’s Mercy to Israel"
Hosea,2,14,"Therefore, lo, I am enticing her, And have caused her to go to the wilderness, And I have spoken unto her heart,"
Hosea,2,15,"And given to her her vineyards from thence, And the valley of Achor for an opening of hope, And she hath responded there as in the days of her youth, And as in the day of her coming up out of the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"And it hath come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of Jehovah, Thou dost call Me—My husband, And dost not call Me any more—My lord."
Hosea,2,17,"And I have turned aside the names of the lords from her mouth, And they are not remembered any more by their name."
Hosea,2,18,"And I have made to them a covenant in that day, with the beast of the field, And with the fowl of the heavens, And the creeping thing of the ground, And bow, and sword, and war I break from off the land, And have caused them to lie down confidently."
Hosea,2,19,"And I have betrothed thee to Me to the age, And betrothed thee to Me in righteousness, And in judgment, and kindness, and mercies,"
Hosea,2,20,"And betrothed thee to Me in faithfulness, And thou hast known Jehovah."
Hosea,2,21,"And it hath come to pass in that day, I answer—an affirmation of Jehovah, I answer the heavens, and they answer the earth."
Hosea,2,22,"And the earth doth answer the corn, And the new wine, and the oil, And they answer Jezreel."
Hosea,2,23,"And I have sowed her to Me in the land, And I have pitied Lo-Ruhamah, And I have said to Lo-Ammi, My people thou art, and it saith, My God!’"
Hosea,3,1,"And Jehovah saith unto me: ‘Again, go, love a woman, loved of a friend, and an adulteress, like the loved of Jehovah, the sons of Israel, and they are turning unto other gods, and are lovers of grape-"
Hosea,3,2,"And I buy her to me for fifteen silverlings, and a homer and a letech of barley; 3and I say unto her, ‘Many days thou dost remain for Me, thou dost not go a-whoring, nor become any one’s; and I"
Hosea,3,4,"For many days remain do the sons of Israel without a king, and there is no prince, and there is no sacrifice, and there is no standing pillar, and there is no ephod and teraphim."
Hosea,3,5,"Afterwards turned back have the sons of Israel, and sought Jehovah their God, and David their king, and have hastened unto Jehovah, and unto His goodness, in the latter end of the days."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear a word of Jehovah, sons of Israel, For a strife is to Jehovah with inhabitants of the land, For there is no truth, nor kindness, Nor knowledge of God, in the land,"
Hosea,4,2,"Swearing, and lying, and murdering, And stealing, and committing adultery—have increased, And blood against blood hath touched."
Hosea,4,3,"Therefore mourn doth the land, And weak is every dweller in it, With the beast of the field, And with the fowl of the heavens, And the fishes of the sea—they are removed."
Hosea,4,4,"Only, let no one strive, nor reprove a man, And thy people are as those striving with a priest."
Hosea,4,5,"And thou hast stumbled in the day, And stumbled hath also a prophet with thee in the night, And I have cut off thy mother."
Hosea,4,6,"Cut off have been My people for lack of knowledge, Because thou knowledge hast rejected, I reject thee from being priest to Me, And thou forgettest the law of thy God, I forget thy sons, I also!"
Hosea,4,7,"According to their abundance so they sinned against Me, Their honour into shame I change."
Hosea,4,8,"The sin of My people they do eat, And unto their iniquity lift up their soul."
Hosea,4,9,"And it hath been, like people, like priest, And I have charged on it its ways, And its habitual doings I return to it."
Hosea,4,10,"And they have eaten, and are not satisfied, They have gone a-whoring, and increase not, For they have left off taking heed to Jehovah."
Hosea,4,11,"Whoredom, and wine, and new wine, take the heart,"
Hosea,4,12,"My people at its staff asketh and its rod declareth to it, For a spirit of whoredoms hath caused to err, And they go a-whoring from under their God."
Hosea,4,13,"On tops of the mountains they do sacrifice, And on the hills they make perfume, Under oak, and poplar, and terebinth, For good is its shade."
Hosea,4,14,"Therefore commit whoredom do your daughters, And your spouses commit adultery, I do not see after your daughters when they commit whoredom, And after your spouses when they commit adultery, For they with the harlots are separated, And with the whores they do sacrifice, A people that doth not understand kicketh."
Hosea,4,15,"Though a harlot thou art, O Israel, Let not Judah become guilty, And come not ye in to Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-Aven, Nor swear ye, Jehovah liveth."
Hosea,4,16,"For as a refractory heifer hath Israel turned aside, Now doth Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place."
Hosea,4,17,"Joined to idols is Ephraim, let him alone."
Hosea,4,18,"Sour is their drink, They have gone diligently a-whoring, Her protectors have loved shame thoroughly."
Hosea,4,19,"Distressed her hath wind with its wings, And they are ashamed of their sacrifices!"
Hosea,5,1,"Hear this, O priests, and attend, O house of Israel, And, O house of the king, give ear, For the judgment is for you, For, a snare ye have been on Mizpah, And a net spread out on Tabor."
Hosea,5,2,"And to slaughter sinners have gone deep, And I am a fetter to them all."
Hosea,5,3,"I have known Ephraim, And Israel hath not been hid from me, For now thou hast gone a-whoring, Ephraim, Defiled is Israel."
Hosea,5,4,"They give not up their habitual doings, To turn back unto their God, For a spirit of whoredoms is in their midst, And Jehovah they have not known."
Hosea,5,5,"And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face, And Israel and Ephraim stumble by their iniquity, Stumbled also hath Judah with them."
Hosea,5,6,"With their flock and with their herd, They go to seek Jehovah, and do not find, He hath withdrawn from them."
Hosea,5,7,"Against Jehovah they dealt treacherously, For strange sons they have begotten, Now consume them doth a month with their portions."
Hosea,5,8,"Blow ye a cornet in Gibeah, a trumpet in Ramah, Shout, O Beth-Aven, after thee, O Benjamin."
Hosea,5,9,"Ephraim is for a desolation in a day of reproof, Among the tribes of Israel I have made known a sure thing."
Hosea,5,10,"Princes of Judah have been as those removing a border, On them I do pour out as water My wrath."
Hosea,5,11,"Oppressed is Ephraim, broken in judgment, When he pleased he went after the command."
Hosea,5,12,"And I am as a moth to Ephraim, And as a rotten thing to the house of Judah."
Hosea,5,13,"And see doth Ephraim his sickness, and Judah his wound, And Ephraim goeth unto Asshur, And sendeth unto a warlike king, And he is not able to give healing to you, Nor doth he remove from you a scar."
Hosea,5,14,"For I am as a lion to Ephraim, And as a young lion to the house of Judah, I—I tear and go, I bear away, and there is no deliverer."
Hosea,5,15,"I go—I turn back unto My place, Till that they are desolate, and have sought My face. In their distress they do seek Me speedily!’"
Hosea,6,2,"He doth revive us after two days, In the third day He doth raise us up, And we live before Him."
Hosea,6,3,"And we know—we pursue to know Jehovah, As the dawn prepared is His going forth, And He cometh in as a shower to us, As gathered rain—sprinkling earth.’"
Hosea,6,4,"What do I do to thee, O Ephraim? What do I do to thee, O Judah? Your goodness is as a cloud of the morning, And as dew rising early—going."
Hosea,6,5,"Therefore I have hewed by prophets, I have slain them by sayings of My mouth, And My judgments to the light goeth forth."
Hosea,6,6,"For kindness I desired, and not sacrifice, And a knowledge of God above burnt-offerings."
Hosea,6,7,"And they, as Adam, transgressed a covenant, There they dealt treacherously against me."
Hosea,6,8,"Gilead is a city of workers of iniquity, Slippery from blood."
Hosea,6,9,"And as bands do wait for a man, A company of priests do murder—the way to Shechem, For wickedness they have done."
Hosea,6,10,"In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing, There is the whoredom of Ephraim—defiled is Israel."
Hosea,6,11,"Also, O Judah, appointed is a harvest to thee, In My turning back to the captivity of My people!"
Hosea,7,2,"And they do not say to their heart, That all their evil I have remembered, Now compassed them have their doings, Over-against My face they have been."
Hosea,7,3,"With their wickedness they make glad a king, And with their lies—princes."
Hosea,7,4,"All of them are adulterers, Like a burning oven of a baker, He ceaseth from stirring up after kneading the dough, till its leavening."
Hosea,7,5,"A day of our king! Princes have polluted themselves with the poison of wine, He hath drawn out his hand with scorners."
Hosea,7,6,"For they have drawn near, As an oven is their heart, In their lying in wait all the night sleep doth their baker, Morning! he is burning as a flaming fire."
Hosea,7,7,"All of them are warm as an oven, And they have devoured their judges, All their kings have fallen, There is none calling unto Me among them."
Hosea,7,8,"Ephraim! among peoples he mixeth himself, Ephraim hath been a cake unturned."
Hosea,7,9,"Devoured have strangers his power, And he hath not known, Also old age hath sprinkled itself on him, And he hath not known."
Hosea,7,10,"And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face, And they have not turned back unto Jehovah their God, Nor have they sought Him for all this."
Hosea,7,11,"And Ephraim is as a simple dove without heart, Egypt they called on—to Asshur they have gone."
Hosea,7,12,"When they go I spread over them My net, As the fowl of the heavens I bring them down, I chastise them as their company hath heard."
Hosea,7,13,"Woe to them, for they wandered from Me, Destruction to them, for they transgressed against Me, And I—I ransom them, and they have spoken lies against Me,"
Hosea,7,14,"And have not cried unto Me with their heart, but howl on their beds, For corn and new wine they assemble themselves, They turn aside against Me."
Hosea,7,15,"And I instructed—I strengthened their arms, And concerning Me they think evil!"
Hosea,7,16,"They turn back—not to the Most High, They have been as a deceitful bow, Fall by sword do their princes, From the insolence of their tongue, This is their derision in the land of Egypt!"
Hosea,8,2,"To Me they cry, ‘My God, we—Israel—have known Thee.’"
Hosea,8,3,"Cast off good hath Israel, an enemy pursueth him."
Hosea,8,4,"They have made kings, and not by Me, They have made princes, and I have not known, Their silver and their gold they have made to them idols, So that they are cut off."
Hosea,8,5,"Cast off hath thy calf, O Samaria, Burned hath Mine anger against them, Till when are they not capable of purity?"
Hosea,8,6,"For even it is of Israel; an artificer made it, And it is not God, For the calf of Samaria is fragments!"
Hosea,8,7,"For wind they sow, and a hurricane they reap, Stalk it hath none—a shoot not yielding grain, If so be it yield—strangers do swallow it up."
Hosea,8,8,"Israel hath been swallowed up, Now they have been among nations, As a vessel in which is no delight."
Hosea,8,9,"For they—they have gone up to Asshur, A wild ass alone by himself is Ephraim, They have hired lovers!"
Hosea,8,10,"Also though they hire among nations, Now I gather them, and they are pained a little, From the burden of a king of princes."
Hosea,8,11,"Because Ephraim did multiply altars to sin, They have been to him altars to sin."
Hosea,8,12,"I write for him numerous things of My law, As a strange thing they have been reckoned."
Hosea,8,13,"The sacrifices of Mine offerings! They sacrifice flesh, and they eat, Jehovah hath not accepted them, Now doth He remember their iniquity, And inspect their sin, They—to Egypt they turn back."
Hosea,8,14,"And forget doth Israel his Maker, and buildeth temples, And Judah hath multiplied cities of defence, And I have sent a fire into his cities, And it hath consumed their palaces!"
Hosea,9,2,"Floor and wine-press do not delight them, And new wine doth fail in her,"
Hosea,9,3,"They do not abide in the land of Jehovah, And turned back hath Ephraim to Egypt, And in Asshur an unclean thing they eat."
Hosea,9,4,"They pour not out wine to Jehovah, Nor are they sweet to Him, Their sacrifices are as bread of mourners to them, All eating it are unclean: For their bread is for themselves, It doth not come into the house of Jehovah."
Hosea,9,5,What do ye at the day appointed? And at the day of Jehovah’s festival?
Hosea,9,6,"For, lo, they have gone because of destruction, Egypt gathereth them, Moph burieth them, The desirable things of their silver, Nettles possess them—a thorn is in their tents."
Hosea,9,7,"Come in have the days of inspection, Come in have the days of recompence, Israel doth know! a fool is the prophet, Mad is the man of the Spirit, Because of the abundance of thine iniquity, And great is the hatred."
Hosea,9,8,"Ephraim is looking away from My God, The prophet! a snare of a fowler is over all his ways, Hatred is in the house of his God."
Hosea,9,9,"They have gone deep—have done corruptly, As in the days of Gibeah, He doth remember their iniquity, He doth inspect their sins."
Hosea,9,10,"As grapes in a wilderness I found Israel, As the first-fruit in a fig-tree, at its beginning, I have seen your fathers, They—they have gone in to Baal-Peor, And are separated to a shameful thing, And are become abominable like their love."
Hosea,9,11,"Ephraim is as a fowl, Fly away doth their honour, without birth, And without womb, and without conception."
Hosea,9,12,"For though they nourish their sons, I have made them childless—without man, Surely also, woe to them, when I turn aside from them."
Hosea,9,13,"Ephraim! when I have looked to the rock, Is planted in comeliness, And Ephraim is to bring out unto a slayer his sons."
Hosea,9,14,"Give to them, Jehovah—what dost Thou give? Give to them miscarrying womb, and dry breasts."
Hosea,9,15,"All their evil is in Gilgal, Surely there I have hated them, Because of the evil of their doings, Out of My house I do drive them, I add not to love them, all their heads are apostates."
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim hath been smitten, Their root hath dried up, fruit they yield not, Yea, though they bring forth, I have put to death the desired of their womb."
Hosea,9,17,"Reject them doth my God, Because they have not hearkened to Him, And they are wanderers among nations!"
Hosea,10,1,"An empty vine is Israel, Fruit he maketh like to himself, According to the abundance of his fruit, He hath multiplied for the altars, According to the goodness of his land, They have made goodly standing- pillars."
Hosea,10,2,"Their heart hath been divided, now they are guilty, He doth break down their altars, He doth destroy their standing-pillars."
Hosea,10,3,"For now they say: We have no king, Because we have not feared Jehovah, And the king—what doth he for us?"
Hosea,10,4,"They have spoken words, To swear falsehood in making a covenant, And flourished as a poisonous herb hath judgment, on the furrows of a field."
Hosea,10,5,"For the calves of Beth-Aven fear do inhabitants of Samaria, Surely mourned on account of it hath its people, And its priests on account of it leap about, Because of its honour, for it hath removed from it,"
Hosea,10,6,"Also it to Asshur is carried, a present to a warlike king, Shame doth Ephraim receive, And ashamed is Israel of its own counsel."
Hosea,10,7,Cut off is Samaria! Its king is as a chip on the face of the waters.
Hosea,10,8,"And destroyed have been high places of Aven, the sin of Israel. Thorn and bramble go up on their altars, And they have said to hills, Cover us, And to heights, Fall upon us."
Hosea,10,9,"From the days of Gibeah thou hast sinned, O Israel, There they have stood, Not overtake them in Gibeah doth battle, Because of sons of perverseness."
Hosea,10,10,"When I desire, then I do bind them, And gathered against them have peoples, When they bind themselves to their two iniquities."
Hosea,10,11,"And Ephraim is a trained heifer—loving to thresh, And I—I have passed over on the goodness of its neck, I cause one to ride Ephraim, Plough doth Judah, harrow for him doth Jacob."
Hosea,10,12,"Sow for yourselves in righteousness, Reap according to loving-kindness, Till for yourselves tillage of knowledge, To seek Jehovah, Till he come and shew righteousness to you."
Hosea,10,13,"Ye have ploughed wickedness, Perversity ye have reaped, Ye have eaten the fruit of lying, For thou hast trusted in thy way, In the abundance of thy might."
Hosea,10,14,"And rise doth a tumult among thy people, And all thy fortresses are spoiled, As the spoiling of Shalman of Beth-Arbel, In a day of battle, Mother against sons dashed in pieces."
Hosea,10,15,"Thus hath Beth-El done to you, Because of the evil of your wickedness, In the dawn cut off utterly is a king of Israel!"
Hosea,11,1,"Because Israel is a youth, and I love him, Out of Egypt I have called for My Son."
Hosea,11,2,"They have called to them rightly, They have gone from before them, To lords they do sacrifice, And to graven images they make perfume."
Hosea,11,3,"And I have caused Ephraim to go on foot, Taking them by their arms, And they have not known that I strengthened them."
Hosea,11,4,"With cords of man I do draw them, With thick cords of love, And I am to them as a raiser up of a yoke on their jaws, And I incline unto him—I feed him."
Hosea,11,5,"He turneth not back unto the land of Egypt, And Asshur—he is his king, For they have refused to return."
Hosea,11,6,"Grievous hath been the sword in his cities, And it hath ended his bars, and consumed—from their own counsels."
Hosea,11,7,"And My people are hanging in suspense, about My returning, And unto the Most High they do call, Together they exalt not. God’s Love for Israel"
Hosea,11,8,"How do I give thee up, O Ephraim? Do I deliver thee up, O Israel? How do I make thee as Admah? Do I set thee as Zeboim? Turned in Me is My heart, kindled together have been My repentings."
Hosea,11,9,"I do not the fierceness of My anger, I turn not back to destroy Ephraim, For God I am, and not a man. In thy midst the Holy One, and I enter not in enmity,"
Hosea,11,10,"After Jehovah they go—as a lion He roareth, When He doth roar, then tremble do the sons from the west."
Hosea,11,11,"They tremble as a sparrow out of Egypt, And as a dove out of the land of Asshur, And I have caused them to dwell in their own houses, An affirmation of Jehovah."
Hosea,11,12,"Compassed Me with feigning hath Ephraim, And with deceit the house of Israel. And Judah again is ruling with God, And with the Holy Ones is faithful!"
Hosea,12,1,"Ephraim is enjoying wind, And is pursuing an east wind, All the day lying and spoiling he multiplieth, And a covenant with Asshur they make, And oil to Egypt is carried."
Hosea,12,2,"And a controversy hath Jehovah with Judah, To lay a charge on Jacob according to his ways, According to his doings He returneth to him."
Hosea,12,3,"In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And by his strength he was a prince with God,"
Hosea,12,4,"Yea, he is a prince unto the Messenger, And he overcometh by weeping, And he maketh supplication to Him, At Bethel He doth find him, And there He doth speak with us,"
Hosea,12,5,"Even Jehovah, God of the Hosts, Jehovah is His memorial."
Hosea,12,6,"And thou, through thy God, dost turn, Kindness and judgment keep thou, And wait on thy God continually."
Hosea,12,7,Canaan! in his hand are balances of deceit! To oppress he hath loved.
Hosea,12,8,"And Ephraim saith: ‘Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself, All my labours—they find not against me iniquity that is sin.’"
Hosea,12,9,"And I—Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, Again do I turn thee back into tents, As in the days of the appointed time."

Matthew,4,17,"From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say, ‘Reform ye, for come nigh hath the reign of the heavens.’ The First Disciples (Mark 1:16–20; Luke 5:1–11; John 1:35–42)"
Matthew,4,18,"And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea—for they were fishers— 19and he saith to them, ‘Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men,’ 20and they,"
Matthew,4,21,"And having advanced thence, he saw other two brothers, James of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, refitting their nets, and he called them, 22and they, immediately, having left the boat and their father, did follow him. Jesus Heals the Multitudes (Mark 3:7–12; Luke 6:17–19)"
Matthew,4,23,"And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people, 24and his fame went forth to all Syria, and they brought to him all having ailments, pressed with"
Matthew,4,25,"And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan."
Matthew,5,1,"And having seen the multitudes, he went up to the mount, and he having sat down, his disciples came to him, 2and having opened his mouth, he was teaching them, saying: The Beatitudes (Psalm 1:1–6; Luke 6:20–23) 3‘Happy the poor in spirit—because theirs is the reign of the heavens. 4‘Happy the mourning—because they shall be comforted. 5‘Happy the meek—because they shall inherit the land. 6‘Happy those hungering and thirsting for righteousness—because they shall be filled. 7‘Happy the kind—because they shall find kindness. 8‘Happy the clean in heart—because they shall see God. 9‘Happy the peacemakers—because they shall be called Sons of God. 10‘Happy those persecuted for righteousness’ sake—because theirs is the reign of the heavens. 11‘Happy are ye whenever they may reproach you, and may persecute, and may say any evil thing against you falsely for my sake— 12rejoice ye and be glad, because your reward is great in the heavens, for thus did they persecute the prophets who were before you. Salt and Light (Mark 9:49–50; Luke 14:34–35; Philippians 2:12–18) 13‘Ye are the salt of the land, but if the salt may lose savour, in what shall it be salted? for nothing is it good henceforth, except to be cast without, and to be trodden down by men. 14‘Ye are the light of the world, a city set upon a mount is not able to be hid; 15nor do they light a lamp, and put it under the measure, but on the lamp-stand, and it shineth to all those in the house; 16so let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and may glorify your Father who is in the heavens. The Fulfillment of the Law 17‘Do not suppose that I came to throw down the law or the prophets—I did not come to throw down, but to fulfil; 18for, verily I say to you, till that the heaven and the earth may pass away, one iota or"
Matthew,5,19,"Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands—the least—and may teach men so, least he shall be called in the reign of the heavens, but whoever may do and may teach them, he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens. 20‘For I say to you, that if your righteousness may not abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye may not enter to the reign of the heavens. Anger and Reconciliation (Luke 12:57–59) 21‘Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not kill, and whoever may kill shall be in danger of the judgment; 22but I—I say to you, that every one who is angry at his brother without cause, shall be in danger of the judgment, and whoever may say to his brother, Empty fellow! shall be in danger of the sanhedrim, and whoever may say, Rebel! shall be in danger of the gehenna of the fire. 23‘If, therefore, thou mayest bring thy gift to the altar, and there mayest remember that thy brother hath anything against thee, 24leave there thy gift before the altar, and go—first be reconciled to thy brother, and then having come bring thy gift. 25‘Be agreeing with thy opponent quickly, while thou art in the way with him, that the opponent may not deliver thee to the judge, and the judge may deliver thee to the officer, and to prison thou mayest be cast, 26verily I say to thee, thou mayest not come forth thence till that thou mayest pay the last farthing. Adultery (Leviticus 18:1–30) 27‘Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not commit adultery; 28but I—I say to you, that every one who is looking on a woman to desire her, did already commit adultery with her in his heart. 29‘But, if thy right eye doth cause thee to stumble, pluck it out and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna. 30‘And, if thy right hand doth cause thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna. Divorce (Deuteronomy 24:1–5; Luke 16:18) 31‘And it was said, That whoever may put away his wife, let him give to her a writing of divorce; 32but I—I say to you, that whoever may put away his wife, save for the matter of whoredom, doth make her to commit adultery; and whoever may marry her who hath been put away doth commit adultery. Oaths and Vows (Numbers 30:1–16) 33‘Again, ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not swear falsely, but thou shalt pay to the Lord thine oaths; 34but I—I say to you, not to swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is the throne of God, 35nor by the earth, because it is His footstool, nor by Jerusalem, because it is a city of a great king, 36nor by thy head mayest thou swear, because thou art not able one hair to make white or black; 37but let your word be, Yes, Yes, No, No, and that which is more than these is of the evil. Love Your Enemies (Leviticus 24:17–23; Luke 6:27–36) 38‘Ye heard that it was said: Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth; 39but I—I say to you, not to resist the evil, but whoever shall slap thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other; 40and whoever is willing to take thee to law, and thy coat to take—suffer to him also the cloak. 41‘And whoever shall impress thee one mile, go with him two, 42to him who is asking of thee be giving, and him who is willing to borrow from thee thou mayest not turn away. 43‘Ye heard that it was said: Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and shalt hate thine enemy; 44but I—I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those cursing you, do good to those hating you, and pray for those accusing you falsely, and persecuting you, 45that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens, because His sun He doth cause to rise on evil and good, and He doth send rain on righteous and unrighteous. 46‘For, if ye may love those loving you, what reward have ye? do not also the tax-gatherers the same? 47and if ye may salute your brethren only, what do ye abundant? do not also the tax- gatherers so? 48ye shall therefore be perfect, as your Father who is in the heavens is perfect."
Matthew,6,1,"Take heed your kindness not to do before men, to be seen by them, and if not—reward ye have not from your Father who is in the heavens; 2whenever, therefore, thou mayest do kindness, thou mayest not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may have glory from men; verily I say to you—they have their reward! 3‘But thou, doing kindness, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth, 4that thy kindness may be in secret, and thy Father who is seeing in secret Himself shall reward thee manifestly. The Lord’s Prayer (Luke 11:1–4) 5‘And when thou mayest pray, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites, because they love in the synagogues, and in the corners of the broad places—standing—to pray, that they may be seen of men;"
Matthew,6,6,"But thou, when thou mayest pray, go into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who is seeing in secret, shall reward thee manifestly. 7‘And—praying—ye may not use vain repetitions like the nations, for they think that in their much speaking they shall be heard, 8be ye not therefore like to them, for your Father doth know those things that ye have need of before your asking him; 9thus therefore pray ye: ‘Our Father who art in the heavens! hallowed be Thy name. 10‘Thy reign come: Thy will come to pass, as in heaven also on the earth. 11‘Our appointed bread give us to-day. 12‘And forgive us our debts, as also we forgive our debtors. 13‘And mayest Thou not lead us to temptation, but deliver us from the evil, because Thine is the reign,"
Matthew,6,14,"For, if ye may forgive men their trespasses He also will forgive you—your Father who is in the heavens; 15but if ye may not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Proper Fasting 16‘And when ye may fast, be ye not as the hypocrites, of sour countenances, for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men fasting; verily I say to you, that they have their reward. 17‘But thou, fasting, anoint thy head, and wash thy face, 18that thou mayest not appear to men fasting, but to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father, who is seeing in secret, shall reward thee manifestly. Treasures in Heaven (Luke 12:32–34) 19‘Treasure not up to yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust disfigure, and where thieves break through and steal, 20but treasure up to yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth disfigure, and where thieves do not break through nor steal, 21for where your treasure is, there will be also your heart. The Lamp of the Body (Luke 11:33–36) 22‘The lamp of the body is the eye, if, therefore, thine eye may be perfect, all thy body shall be enlightened, 23but if thine eye may be evil, all thy body shall be dark; if, therefore, the light that is in thee is darkness—the darkness, how great! 24‘None is able to serve two lords, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to the one, and despise the other; ye are not able to serve God and Mammon. Do Not Worry (Luke 12:22–31) 25‘Because of this I say to you, be not anxious for your life, what ye may eat, and what ye may drink, nor for your body, what ye may put on. Is not the life more than the nourishment, and the body than the clothing? 26look to the fowls of the heaven, for they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into storehouses, and your heavenly Father doth nourish them; are not ye much better than they? 27‘And who of you, being anxious, is able to add to his age one cubit? 28and about clothing why are ye anxious? consider well the lilies of the field; how do they grow? they do not labour, nor do they spin; 29and I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these. 30‘And if the herb of the field, that to-day is, and to-morrow is cast to the furnace, God doth so clothe—not much more you, O ye of little faith? 31therefore ye may not be anxious, saying, What may we eat? or, What may we drink? or, What may we put round? 32for all these do the nations seek for, for your heavenly Father doth know that ye have need of all these; 33but seek ye first the reign of God and His righteousness, and all these shall be added to you."
Matthew,6,34,"Be not therefore anxious for the morrow, for the morrow shall be anxious for its own things; sufficient for the day is the evil of it."
Matthew,7,3,"And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, and the beam that is in thine own eye dost not consider? 4or, how wilt thou say to thy brother, Suffer I may cast out the mote from thine eye, and lo, the beam is in thine own eye?"
Matthew,7,5,"Hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye."
Matthew,7,6,"Ye may not give that which is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before the swine, that they may not trample them among their feet, and having turned—may rend you. Ask, Seek, Knock (Luke 11:5–13) 7‘Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you; 8for every one who is asking doth receive, and he who is seeking doth find, and to him who is knocking it shall be opened. 9‘Or what man is of you, of whom, if his son may ask a loaf—a stone will he present to him? 10and if a fish he may ask—a serpent will he present to him? 11if, therefore, ye being evil, have known good gifts to give to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him? 12‘All things, therefore, whatever ye may will that men may be doing to you, so also do to them, for this is the law and the prophets. The Narrow Gate (Luke 13:22–30)"
Matthew,7,13,"Go ye in through the strait gate, because wide is the gate, and broad the way that is leading to the destruction, and many are those going in through it; 14how strait is the gate, and compressed the way that is leading to the life, and few are those finding it! A Tree and Its Fruit (Luke 6:43–45) 15‘But, take heed of the false prophets, who come unto you in sheep’s clothing, and inwardly are"
Matthew,7,16,From their fruits ye shall know them; do men gather from thorns grapes? or from
Matthew,7,18,A
Matthew,7,19,"Every tree not yielding good fruit is cut down and is cast to fire: 20therefore from their fruits ye shall know them. 21‘Not every one who is saying to me Lord, lord, shall come into the reign of the heavens; but he who"
Matthew,7,22,"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, lord, have we not in thy name prophesied? and in thy name cast out demons? and in thy name done many mighty things? 23and then I will acknowledge to them, that—I never knew you, depart from me ye who are working lawlessness. The House on the Rock (Luke 6:46–49) 24‘Therefore, every one who doth hear of me these words, and doth do them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house upon the rock; 25and the rain did descend, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and they beat on that house, and it fell not, for it had been founded on the rock. 26‘And every one who is hearing of me these words, and is not doing them, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand; 27and the rain did descend, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and they beat on that house, and it fell, and its fall was great.’ The Authority of Jesus"

Matthew,8,5,"And Jesus having entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion calling upon him, 6and saying, ‘Sir, my young man hath been laid in the house a paralytic, fearfully afflicted,’ 7and Jesus saith"
Matthew,8,8,"And the centurion answering said, ‘Sir, I am not worthy that thou mayest enter under my roof, but only say a word, and my servant shall be healed; 9for I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth, and to"

Matthew,8,16,"And evening having come, they brought to him many demoniacs, and he did cast out the spirits with a word, and did heal all who were ill, 17that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, ‘Himself took our infirmities, and the sicknesses he did bear.’ The Cost of Discipleship (Luke 9:57–62; Luke 14:25–33; John 6:59–66)"

The Patches and the Wineskins (Mark 2:21–22; Luke 5:36–39) 16‘And no one doth put a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment, for its filling up doth take from the garment, and a worse rent is made. 17‘Nor do they put new wine into old skins, and if not—the skins burst, and the wine doth run out, and the skins are destroyed, but they put new wine into new skins, and both are preserved together.’ The Healing Touch of Jesus (Mark 5:21–43; Luke 8:40–56)"

Matthew,10,17,"And, take ye heed of men, for they will give you up to sanhedrims, and in their synagogues they will scourge you, 18and before governors and kings ye shall be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations. 19‘And whenever they may deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye may speak, for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak; 20for ye are not the speakers, but the Spirit of your Father that is speaking in you. 21‘And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and father child, and children shall rise up against parents, and shall put them to death, 22and ye shall be hated by all because of my name, but he who hath endured to the end, he shall be saved. 23‘And whenever they may persecute you in this city, flee to the other, for verily I say to you, ye may not have completed the cities of Israel till the Son of Man may come. 24‘A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his lord; 25sufficient to the disciple that he may be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord; if the master of the house they did call Beelzeboul, how much more those of his household? Fear God Alone (Luke 12:4–7) 26‘Ye may not, therefore, fear them, for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed, and hid, that shall not be known; 27that which I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light, and that which you hear at the ear, proclaim on the house-tops. 28‘And be not afraid of those killing the body, and are not able to kill the soul, but fear rather Him who is able both soul and body to destroy in gehenna. 29‘Are not two sparrows sold for an assar? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father; 30and of you—even the hairs of the head are all numbered; 31be not therefore afraid, than many sparrows ye are better.

Not Peace but a Sword (Micah 7:1–6; Luke 12:49–53) 34‘Ye may not suppose that I came to put peace on the earth; I did not come to put peace, but a sword; 35for I came to set a man at variance against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, 36and the enemies of a man are those of his household. 37‘He who is loving father or mother above me, is not worthy of me, and he who is loving son or daughter above me, is not worthy of me, 38and whoever doth not receive his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me. 39‘He who found his life shall lose it, and he who lost his life for my sake shall find it. The Reward of Service (2 Kings 4:8–17) 40‘He who is receiving you doth receive me, and he who is receiving me doth receive Him who sent me, 41he who is receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s reward, and he who is receiving a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man’s reward, 42and whoever may give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say to you, he may not lose his reward.’"

Matthew,11,7,"And as they are going, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, ‘What went ye out to the wilderness to view?—a reed shaken by the wind? 8‘But what went ye out to see?—a man clothed in soft garments? lo, those wearing the soft things are in the kings’ houses. 9‘But what went ye out to see?—a prophet? yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet, 10for this is he of whom it hath been written, Lo, I do send My messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee."
Matthew,11,11,"Verily I say to you, there hath not risen, among those born of women, a greater than John the Baptist, but he who is least in the reign of the heavens is greater than he. 12‘And, from the days of John the Baptist till now, the reign of the heavens doth suffer violence, and violent men do take it by force, 13for all the prophets and the law till John did prophesy, 14and if ye are willing to receive it, he is Elijah who was about to come; 15he who is having ears to hear—let him hear. 16‘And to what shall I liken this generation? it is like little children in market-places, sitting and calling to their comrades, 17and saying, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance, we lamented to you, and ye did not smite the breast. 18‘For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon; 19the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Lo, a man, a glutton, and a wine- drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners, and wisdom was justified of her children.’ Woe to the Unrepentant (Luke 10:13–16)"
Matthew,11,20,"Then began he to reproach the cities in which were done most of his mighty works, because they did not reform. 21‘Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! because, if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you, long ago in sackcloth and ashes they had reformed; 22but I say to you, to Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in a day of judgment than for you. 23‘And thou, Capernaum, which unto the heaven wast exalted, unto hades shalt be brought down, because if in Sodom had been done the mighty works that were done in thee, it had remained unto this day; 24but I say to you, to the land of Sodom it shall be more tolerable in a day of judgment than to thee.’ Rest for the Weary (Luke 10:21–24)"

Matthew,13,19,"Every one hearing the word of the reign, and not understanding—the evil one doth come, and doth catch that which hath been sown in his heart; this is that sown by the way. 20‘And that sown on the rocky places, this is he who is hearing the word, and immediately with joy is receiving it, 21and he hath not root in himself, but is temporary, and persecution or tribulation having happened because of the word, immediately he is stumbled. 22‘And that sown toward the thorns, this is he who is hearing the word, and the anxiety of this age, and the deceitfulness of the riches, do choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 23‘And that sown on the good ground: this is he who is hearing the word, and is understanding, who indeed doth bear fruit, and doth make, some indeed a hundredfold, and some sixty, and some thirty.’ The Parable of the Weeds (Ezekiel 17:1–10)"
Matthew,13,24,"Another simile he set before them, saying: ‘The reign of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field, 25and, while men are sleeping, his enemy came and sowed darnel in the midst of the wheat, and went away, 26and when the herb sprang up, and yielded fruit, then appeared also the darnel. 27‘And the servants of the householder, having come near, said to him, Sir, good seed didst"
Matthew,13,28,"And he saith to them, A man, an enemy, did this; and the servants said to him, Wilt thou, then, that having gone away we may gather it up? 29‘And he said, No, lest—gathering up the darnel—ye root up with it the wheat, 30suffer both to grow together till the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the darnel, and bind it in bundles, to burn it, and the wheat gather up into my storehouse.’ The Parable of the Mustard Seed (Mark 4:30–34; Luke 13:18–19)"
Matthew,13,31,"Another simile he set before them, saying: ‘The reign of the heavens is like to a grain of mustard, which a man having taken, did sow in his field, 32which less, indeed, is than all the seeds, but when it may be grown, is greatest of the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven do come and rest in its branches.’ The Parable of the Leaven (Luke 13:20–21)"
Matthew,13,33,"Another simile spake he to them: ‘The reign of the heavens is like to leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.’ I Will Open My Mouth in Parables (Psalm 78:1–72)"
Matthew,13,34,"All these things spake Jesus in similes to the multitudes, and without a simile he was not speaking to them, 35that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophet, saying, ‘I will open in similes my mouth, I will utter things having been hidden from the foundation of the world.’ The Parable of the Weeds Explained (Zephaniah 1:1–6)"
Matthew,13,36,"Then having let away the multitudes, Jesus came to the house, and his disciples came near to him,"
Matthew,13,37,"And he answering said to them, ‘He who is sowing the good seed is the Son of Man, 38and the field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of the reign, and the darnel are the sons of the evil one, 39and the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is a full end of the age, and the reapers are messengers. 40‘As, then, the darnel is gathered up, and is burned with fire, so shall it be in the full end of this age, 41the Son of Man shall send forth his messengers, and they shall gather up out of his kingdom all the stumbling- blocks, and those doing the unlawlessness, 42and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth. 43‘Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the reign of their Father. He who is having ears to hear—let him hear. The Parables of the Treasure and the Pearl 44‘Again, the reign of the heavens is like to treasure hid in the field, which a man having found did hide, and from his joy goeth, and all, as much as he hath, he selleth, and buyeth that field. 45‘Again, the reign of the heavens is like to a man, a merchant, seeking goodly pearls, 46who having found one pearl of great price, having gone away, hath sold all, as much as he had, and bought it. The Parable of the Net 47‘Again, the reign of the heavens is like to a net that was cast into the sea, and did gather together of every kind, 48which, when it was filled, having drawn up again upon the beach, and having sat down, they gathered the good into vessels, and the bad they did cast out, 49so shall it be in the full end of the age, the messengers shall come forth and separate the evil out of the midst of the righteous, 50and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire, there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.’"

Matthew,13,53,"And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these similes, he removed thence, 54and having come to his own country, he was teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and were saying, ‘Whence to this one this wisdom and the mighty works? 55is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? 56and his sisters—are they not all with us? whence, then, to this one all these?’ 57and they were stumbled at him.

Luke,9,59,"And he said unto another, ‘Be following me;’ and he said, ‘Sir, permit me, having gone away, first to bury my father;’ 60and Jesus said to him, ‘Suffer the dead to bury their own dead, and thou, having gone away, publish"
Luke,9,61,"And another also said, ‘I will follow thee, sir, but first permit me to take leave of those in my house;’ 62and Jesus said unto him, ‘No one having put his hand on a plough, and looking back, is fit for the reign of God.’"
Luke,10,1,"And after these things, the Lord did appoint also other seventy, and sent them by twos before his face, to every city and place whither he himself was about to come, 2then said he unto them, ‘The harvest indeed is abundant, but the workmen few; beseech ye then the Lord of the harvest, that He may put forth workmen to His harvest. 3‘Go away; lo, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves; 4carry no bag, no scrip, nor sandals; and salute no one on the way; 5and into whatever house ye do enter, first say, Peace to this house; 6and if indeed there may be there the son of peace, rest on it"
Luke,10,7,"And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things they have, for worthy is the workman of his hire; go not from house to house, 8and into whatever city ye enter, and they may receive you, eat the things set before you, 9and heal the ailing in it, and say to them, The reign of God hath come nigh to you. 10‘And into whatever city ye do"
Luke,10,11,"And the dust that hath cleaved to us, from your city, we do wipe off against you, but this know ye, that the reign of God hath come nigh to you; 12and I say to you, that for Sodom in that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city. Woe to the Unrepentant (Matthew 11:20–24) 13‘Woe to thee, Chorazin; woe to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you, long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, they had reformed; 14but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment than for you. 15‘And thou, Capernaum, which unto the heaven wast exalted, unto hades thou shalt be brought down. 16‘He who is hearing you, doth hear me; and he who is putting you away, doth put me away; and he who is putting me away, doth put away Him who sent me.’ The Joyful Return"
Luke,10,17,"And the seventy turned back with joy, saying, ‘Sir, and the demons are being subjected to us in thy name;’ 18and he said to them, ‘I was beholding the Adversary, as lightning from the heaven having fallen; 19lo, I give to you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy, and nothing by any means shall hurt you; 20but, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice rather that your names were written in the heavens.’ Jesus’ Prayer of Thanksgiving (Matthew 11:25–30)"

Luke,10,29,"And he, willing to declare himself righteous, said unto Jesus, ‘And who is my neighbour?’ 30and Jesus having taken up the word, said, ‘A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, and having stripped him and inflicted blows, they went away, leaving him half dead. 31‘And by a coincidence a certain priest was going down in that way, and having seen him, he passed over on the opposite side; 32and in like manner also, a Levite, having been about the place, having come and seen, passed over on the opposite side. 33‘But a certain Samaritan, journeying, came along him, and having seen him, he was moved with compassion, 34and having come near, he bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and having lifted him up on his own beast, he brought him to an inn, and was careful of him; 35and on the morrow, going forth, taking out two denaries, he gave to the innkeeper, and said to him, Be careful of him, and whatever thou mayest spend more, I, in my coming again, will give back to thee. 36‘Who, then, of these three, seemeth to thee to have become neighbour of him who fell among the robbers?’ 37and he said, ‘He who did the kindness with him,’ then Jesus said to him, ‘Be going on, and thou be doing in like manner.’ Martha and Mary"
Luke,10,38,"And it came to pass, in their going on, that he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman, by name Martha, did receive him into her house, 39and she had also a sister, called Mary, who also, having seated herself beside the feet of Jesus, was hearing the word, 40and Martha was distracted about much serving, and having stood by him, she said, ‘Sir, dost thou not care that my sister left me"
Luke,10,41,"And Jesus answering said to her, ‘Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and disquieted about many things, 42but of one thing there is need, and Mary the good part did choose, that shall not be taken away from her.’"
Luke,11,1,"And it came to pass, in his being in a certain place praying, as he ceased, a certain one of his disciples said unto him, ‘Sir, teach us to pray, as also John taught his disciples.’"
Luke,11,2,"And he said to them, ‘When ye may pray, say ye: Our Father who art in the heavens; hallowed be Thy name: Thy reign come; Thy will come to pass, as in heaven also on earth; 3our appointed bread be giving us daily; 4and forgive us our sins, for also we ourselves forgive every one indebted to us; and mayest Thou not bring us into temptation; but do Thou deliver us from the evil.’ Ask, Seek, Knock (Matthew 7:7–12)"
Luke,11,5,"And he said unto them, ‘Who of you shall have a friend, and shall go on unto him at midnight, and may say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves, 6seeing a friend of mine came out of the way unto me, and I have not what I shall set before him, 7and he from within answering may say, Do not give me trouble, already the door hath been shut, and my children with me are in the bed, I am not able, having risen, to give to thee. 8‘I say to you, even if he will not give to him, having risen, because of his being his friend, yet because of his importunity, having risen, he will give him as many as he doth need; 9and I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you; 10for every one who is asking doth receive; and he who is seeking doth find; and to him who is knocking it shall be opened. 11‘And of which of you—the father—if the son shall ask a loaf, a stone will he present to him? and if a fish, will he instead of a fish, a serpent present to him? 12and"

Luke,11,14,"And he was casting forth a demon, and it was dumb, and it came to pass, the demon having gone forth, the dumb man spake, and the multitudes wondered, 15and certain of them said, ‘By Beelzeboul, ruler of the demons, he doth cast forth the demons;’ 16and others, tempting, a sign out of heaven"
Luke,11,17,"And he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, ‘Every kingdom having been divided against itself is desolated; and house against house doth fall; 18and if also the Adversary against himself was divided, how shall his kingdom be made to stand? for ye say, by Beelzeboul is my casting forth the demons. 19‘But if I by Beelzeboul cast forth the demons—your sons, by whom do they cast forth? because of this your judges they shall be; 20but if by the finger of God I cast forth the demons, then come unawares upon you did the reign of God. 21‘When the strong man armed may keep his hall, in peace are his goods; 22but when the stronger than he, having come upon him, may overcome him, his whole-armour he doth take away in which he had trusted, and his spoils he distributeth; 23he who is not with me is against me, and he who is not gathering with me doth scatter. An Unclean Spirit Returns (Matthew 12:43–45) 24‘When the unclean spirit may go forth from the man it walketh through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding, it saith, I will turn back to my house whence I came forth; 25and having come, it findeth it swept and adorned; 26then doth it go, and take to it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and having entered, they dwell there, and the last of that man becometh worst than the first.’ True Blessedness"

Luke,11,28,"And he said, ‘Yea, rather, happy those hearing the word of God, and keeping it!’ The Sign of Jonah (Jonah 3:1–10; Matthew 12:38–42)"
Luke,11,29,"And the multitudes crowding together upon him, he began to say, ‘This generation is evil, a sign it doth seek after, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet, 30for as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also shall the Son of Man be to this generation. 31‘A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo, greater than Solomon here! 32‘Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, because they reformed at the proclamation of Jonah; and lo, greater than Jonah here! The Lamp of the Body (Matthew 6:22–24)"
Luke,11,33,"And no one having lighted a lamp, doth put it in a secret place, nor under the measure, but on the lamp-stand, that those coming in may behold the light. 34‘The lamp of the body is the eye, when then thine eye may be simple, thy whole body also is lightened; and when it may be evil, thy body also is darkened; 35take heed, then, lest the light that is in thee be darkness; 36if then thy whole body is lightened, not having any part darkened, the whole shall be lightened, as when the lamp by the brightness may give thee light.’ Woes to Pharisees and Experts in the Law (Matthew 23:1–36)"
Luke,11,37,"And in his speaking, a certain Pharisee was asking him that he might dine with him, and having gone in, he reclined (at meat), 38and the Pharisee having seen, did wonder that he did not first baptize"
Luke,11,39,"And the Lord said unto him, ‘Now do ye, the Pharisees, the outside of the cup and of the plate make clean, but your inward part is full of rapine and wickedness; 40unthinking!"
Luke,11,41,"But what ye have give ye as alms, and, lo, all things are clean to you. 42‘But woe to you, the Pharisees, because ye tithe the mint, and the rue, and every herb, and ye pass by the judgment, and the love of God; these things it behoveth to do, and those not to be neglecting. 43‘Woe to you, the Pharisees, because ye love the first seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the market-places. 44‘Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because ye are as the unseen tombs, and the men walking above have not known.’"
Luke,11,45,"And one of the lawyers answering, saith to him, ‘Teacher, these things saying, us also thou dost insult;’ 46and he said, ‘And to you, the lawyers, woe! because ye burden men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves with one of your fingers do not touch the burdens. 47‘Woe to you,"
Luke,11,48,"Then do ye testify, and are well pleased with the works of your fathers, because they indeed killed them, and ye do build their tombs; 49because of this also the wisdom of God said: I will send to them prophets, and apostles, and some of them they shall kill and persecute, 50that the blood of all the prophets, that is being poured forth from the foundation of the world, may be required from this generation; 51from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, who perished between the altar and the house; yes, I say to you, It shall be required from this generation. 52‘Woe to you, the lawyers, because ye took away the key of the knowledge; yourselves ye did not enter; and those coming in, ye did hinder.’"
Luke,11,53,"And in his speaking these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began fearfully to urge and to press him to speak about many things, 54laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him."
Luke,12,1,"At which time the myriads of the multitude having been gathered together, so as to tread upon one another, he began to say unto his disciples, first, ‘Take heed to yourselves of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy; 2and there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known; 3because whatever in the darkness ye said, in the light shall be heard: and what to the ear ye spake in the inner-chambers, shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops. Fear God Alone (Matthew 10:26–31) 4‘And I say to you, my friends, be not afraid of those killing the body, and after these things are not having anything over to do; 5but I will show to you, whom ye may fear; Fear him who, after the killing, is having authority to cast to the gehenna; yes, I say to you, Fear ye Him. 6‘Are not five sparrows sold for two assars? and one of them is not forgotten before God, 7but even the hairs of your head have been all numbered; therefore fear ye not, than many sparrows ye are of more value. Confessing Christ (Matthew 10:32–33) 8‘And I say to you, Every one—whoever may confess with me before men, the Son of Man also shall confess with him before the messengers of God, 9and he who hath denied me before men, shall be denied before the messengers of God, 10and every one whoever shall say a word to the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven to him, but to him who to the Holy Spirit did speak evil, it shall not be forgiven. 11‘And when they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, be not anxious how or what ye may reply, or what ye may say, 12for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that hour what it behoveth you to say.’ The Parable of the Rich Fool"
Luke,12,13,"And a certain one said to him, out of the multitude, ‘Teacher, say to my brother to divide with me"
Luke,12,14,"And he said to him, ‘Man, who set me a judge or a divider over you?’"
Luke,12,15,"And he said unto them, ‘Observe, and beware of the covetousness, because not in the abundance of one’s goods"
Luke,12,16,"And he spake a simile unto them, saying, ‘Of a certain rich man the field brought forth well; 17and he was reasoning within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have not where I shall gather together my fruits? 18and he said, This I will do, I will take down my storehouses, and greater ones I will build, and I will gather together there all my products and my good things, 19and I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many good things laid up for many years, be resting, eat, drink, be merry. 20‘And God said to him, Unthinking one! this night thy soul they shall require from thee, and what things thou didst prepare—to whom shall they be? 21so is he who is treasuring up to himself, and is not rich toward God.’ Do Not Worry (Matthew 6:25–34)"
Luke,12,22,"And he said unto his disciples, ‘Because of this, to you I say, Be not anxious for your life, what ye may eat; nor for the body, what ye may put on; 23the life is more than the nourishment, and the body than the clothing. 24‘Consider the ravens, that they sow not, nor reap, to which there is no barn nor storehouse, and God doth nourish them; how much better are ye than the fowls? 25and who of you,"
Luke,12,26,"If, then, ye are not able for the least—why for the rest are ye anxious? 27‘Consider the lilies, how do they grow? they labour not, nor do they spin, and I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these; 28and if the herbage in the field, that to-day is, and to-morrow into an oven is cast, God doth so clothe, how much more you—ye of little faith? 29‘And ye—seek not what ye may eat, or what ye may drink, and be not in suspense, 30for all these things do the nations of the world seek after, and your Father hath known that ye have need of these things; 31but, seek ye the reign of God, and all these things shall be added to you. Treasures in Heaven (Matthew 6:19–21) 32‘Fear not, little flock, because your Father did delight to give you the reign; 33sell your goods, and give alms, make to yourselves bags that become not old, a treasure unfailing in the heavens, where thief doth not come near, nor moth destroy; 34for where your treasure is, there also your heart will be. Readiness at Any Hour (Matthew 24:36–51; Mark 13:32–37) 35‘Let your loins be girded, and the lamps burning, 36and ye like to men waiting for their lord, when he shall return out of the wedding feasts, that he having come and knocked, immediately they may open to him. 37‘Happy those servants, whom the lord, having come, shall find watching; verily I say to you, that he will gird himself, and will cause them to recline (at meat), and having come near, will minister to them; 38and if he may come in the second watch, and in the third watch he may come, and may find it so, happy are those servants. 39‘And this know, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief doth come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through; 40and ye, then, become ye ready, because at the hour ye think not, the Son of Man doth come.’"
Luke,12,41,"And Peter said to him, ‘Sir, unto us this simile dost thou speak, or also unto all?’"
Luke,12,42,"And the Lord said, ‘Who, then, is the faithful and prudent steward whom the lord shall set over his household, to give in"
Luke,12,43,"Happy that servant, whom his lord, having come, shall find doing so; 44truly I say to you, that over all his goods he will set him. 45‘And if that servant may say in his heart, My lord doth delay to come, and may begin to beat the men-servants and the maid-servants, to eat also, and to drink, and to be drunken; 46the lord of that servant will come in a day in which he doth not look for him, and in an hour that he doth not know, and will cut him off, and his portion with the unfaithful he will appoint. 47‘And that servant, who having known his lord’s will, and not having prepared, nor having gone according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes, 48and he who, not having known, and having done things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few; and to every one to whom much was given, much shall be required from him; and to whom they did commit much, more abundantly they will ask of him. Not Peace but Division (Micah 7:1–6; Matthew 10:34–39) 49‘Fire I came to cast to the earth, and what will I if already it was kindled? 50but I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I pressed till it may be completed! 51‘Think ye that peace I came to give in the earth? no, I say to you, but rather division; 52for there shall be henceforth five in one house divided—three against two, and two against three; 53a father shall be divided against a son, and a son against a father, a mother against a daughter, and a daughter against a mother, a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.’ Interpreting the Present Time (Matthew 16:1–4; Mark 8:11–13)"
Luke,12,54,"And he said also to the multitudes, ‘When ye may see the cloud rising from the west, immediately ye say, A shower doth come, and it is so; 55and when—a south wind blowing, ye say, that there will be heat, and it is; 56hypocrites! the face of the earth and of the heaven ye have known to make proof of, but this time—how do ye not make proof of it? Reconciling with an Adversary (Matthew 5:21–26) 57‘And why, also, of yourselves, judge ye not what is righteous? 58for, as thou art going away with thy opponent to the ruler, in the way give diligence to be released from him, lest he may drag thee unto"

Luke,13,6,"And he spake this simile: ‘A certain one had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit in it, and he did not find; 7and he said unto the vine-dresser, Lo, three years I come seeking fruit in this fig-tree, and do not find, cut it off, why also the ground doth it render useless? 8‘And he answering saith to him, Sir, suffer it also this year, till that I may dig about it, and cast in dung; 9and if indeed it may bear fruit—;and if not so, thereafter thou shalt cut it off.’ Jesus Heals a Disabled Woman"
Luke,13,10,"And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath, 11and lo, there was a woman having a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bowed together, and not able to bend back at all, 12and Jesus having seen her, did call her near, and said to her, ‘Woman, thou hast been loosed from thy infirmity;’ 13and he laid on her his hands, and presently she was set upright, and was glorifying"
Luke,13,14,"And the chief of the synagogue answering—much displeased that on the sabbath Jesus healed— said to the multitude, ‘Six days there are in which it behoveth us to be working; in these, then, coming,"
Luke,13,15,"Then the Lord answered him and said, ‘Hypocrite, doth not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or ass from the stall, and having led away, doth water it? 16and this one, being a daughter of Abraham, whom the Adversary bound, lo, eighteen years, did it"
Luke,13,17,"And he saying these things, all who were opposed to him were being ashamed, and all the multitude were rejoicing over all the glorious things that are being done by him. The Parable of the Mustard Seed (Matthew 13:31–32; Mark 4:30–34)"
Luke,13,18,"And he said, ‘To what is the reign of God like? and to what shall I liken it?"

Luke,13,22,"And he was going through cities and villages, teaching, and making progress toward Jerusalem; 23and a certain one said to him, ‘Sir, are those saved few?’ and he said unto them, 24‘Be striving to go in through the straight gate, because many, I say to you, will seek to go in, and shall not be able; 25from the time the master of the house may have risen up, and may have shut the door, and ye may begin without to stand, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, lord, open to us, and he answering shall say to you, I have not known you whence ye are, 26then ye may begin to say, We did eat before thee, and did drink, and in our broad places thou didst teach; 27and he shall say, I say to you, I have not known you whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of the unrighteousness. 28‘There shall be there the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth, when ye may see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the reign of God, and yourselves being cast out without; 29and they shall come from east and west, and from north and south, and shall recline in the reign of God, 30and lo, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.’ Lament over Jerusalem (Matthew 23:37–39)"

The Parable of the Guests"
Luke,14,7,"And he spake a simile unto those called, marking how they were choosing out the first couches, saying unto them, 8‘When thou mayest be called by any one to marriage-feasts, thou mayest not recline on the first couch, lest a more honourable than thou may have been called by him, 9and he who did call thee and him having come shall say to thee, Give to this one place, and then thou mayest begin with shame to occupy the last place. 10‘But, when thou mayest be called, having gone on, recline in the last place, that when he who called thee may come, he may say to thee, Friend, come up higher; then thou shalt have glory before those reclining with thee; 11because every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted.’"
Luke,14,12,"And he said also to him who did call him, ‘When thou mayest make a dinner or a supper, be not calling thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kindred, nor rich neighbours, lest they may also call thee again, and a recompense may come to thee; 13but when thou mayest make a feast, be calling poor, maimed, lame, blind, 14and happy thou shalt be, because they have not to recompense thee, for it shall be recompensed to thee in the rising again of the righteous.’ The Parable of the Banquet (Matthew 22:1–14)"
Luke,14,15,"And one of those reclining with him, having heard these things, said to him, ‘Happy is he who shall eat bread in the reign of God;’ 16and he said to him, ‘A certain man made a great supper, and called many, 17and he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to those having been called, Be coming, because now are all things ready. 18‘And they began with one consent all to excuse themselves: The first said to him, A field I bought, and I have need to go forth and see it; I beg of thee, have me excused. 19‘And another said, Five yoke of oxen I bought, and I go on to prove them; I beg of thee, have me excused: 20and another said, A wife I married, and because of this I am not able to come. 21‘And that servant having come, told to his lord these things, then the master of the house, having been angry, said to his servant, Go forth quickly to the broad places and lanes of the city, and the poor, and maimed, and lame, and blind, bring in hither. 22‘And the servant said, Sir, it hath been done as thou didst command, and still there is room. 23‘And the lord said unto the servant, Go forth to the ways and hedges, and constrain to come in, that my house may be filled; 24for I say to you, that none of those men who have been called shall taste of my supper.’ The Cost of Discipleship (Matthew 8:18–22; Luke 9:57–62; John 6:59–66)"
Luke,14,25,"And there were going on with him great multitudes, and having turned, he said unto them, 26‘If any one doth come unto me, and doth not hate his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, and yet even his own life, he is not able to be my disciple; 27and whoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, is not able to be my disciple. 28‘For who of you, willing to build a tower, doth not first, having sat down, count the expence, whether he have the things for completing? 29lest that he having laid a foundation, and not being able to finish, all who are beholding may begin to mock him, 30saying—This man began to build, and was not able to finish. 31‘Or what king going on to engage with another king in war, doth not, having sat down, first consult if he be able with ten thousand to meet him who with twenty thousand is coming against him? 32and if not so—he being yet a long way off—having sent an embassy, he doth ask the things for peace. 33‘So, then, every one of you who doth not take leave of all that he himself hath, is not able to be my disciple.

Luke,15,3,"And he spake unto them this simile, saying, 4‘What man of you having a hundred sheep, and having lost one out of them, doth not leave behind the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go on after the lost one, till he may find it? 5and having found, he doth lay it on his shoulders rejoicing, 6and having come to the house, he doth call together the friends and the neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me, because I found my sheep—the lost one. 7‘I say to you, that so joy shall be in the heaven over one sinner reforming, rather than over ninety-nine righteous men, who have no need of reformation. The Parable of the Lost Coin 8‘Or what woman having ten drachms, if she may lose one drachm, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek carefully till that she may find? 9and having found, she doth call together the female friends and the neighbours, saying, Rejoice with me, for I found the drachm that I lost. 10‘So I say to you, joy doth come before the messengers of God over one sinner reforming.’ The Parable of the Prodigal Son (Deuteronomy 21:18–21)"
Luke,15,11,"And he said, ‘A certain man had two sons, 12and the younger of them said to the father, Father, give me the portion of the substance falling to me, and he divided to them the living. 13‘And not many days after, having gathered all together, the younger son went abroad to a far country, and there he scattered his substance, living riotously; 14and he having spent all, there came a mighty famine on that country, and himself began to be in want; 15and having gone on, he joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him to the fields to feed swine, 16and he was desirous to fill his belly from the husks that the swine were eating, and no one was giving to him. 17‘And having come to himself, he said, How many hirelings of my father have a superabundance of bread, and I here with hunger am perishing! 18having risen, I will go on unto my father, and will say to him, Father, I did sin—to the heaven, and before thee, 19and no more am I worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hirelings. 20‘And having risen, he went unto his own father, and he being yet far distant, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and having ran he fell upon his neck and kissed him; 21and the son said to him, Father, I did sin—to the heaven, and before thee, and no more am I worthy to be called thy son. 22‘And the father said unto his servants, Bring forth the first robe, and clothe him, and give a ring for his hand, and sandals for the feet; 23and having brought the fatted calf, kill it, and having eaten, we may be merry, 24because this my son was dead, and did live again, and he was lost, and was found; and they began to be merry. 25‘And his elder son was in a field, and as, coming, he drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing, 26and having called near one of the young men, he was inquiring what these things might be, 27and he said to him—Thy brother is arrived, and thy father did kill the fatted calf, because in health he did receive him back. 28‘And he was angry, and would not go in, therefore his father, having come forth, was entreating him; 29and he answering said to the father, Lo, so many years I do serve thee, and never thy command did I transgress, and to me thou didst never give a kid, that with my friends I might make merry; 30but when thy son—this one who did devour thy living with harlots— came, thou didst kill to him the fatted calf. 31‘And he said to him, Child, thou art always with me, and all my things are thine; 32but to be merry, and to be glad, it was needful, because this thy brother was dead, and did live again, he was lost, and was found.’"
Luke,16,1,"And he said also unto his disciples, ‘A certain man was rich, who had a steward, and he was accused to him as scattering his goods; 2and having called him, he said to him, What is this I hear about thee? render the account of thy stewardship, for thou mayest not any longer be steward. 3‘And the steward said in himself, What shall I do, because my lord doth take away the stewardship from me? to dig I"
Luke,16,4,"I have known what I shall do, that, when I may be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me to their houses. 5‘And having called near each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much dost thou owe to my lord? 6and he said, A hundred baths of oil; and he said to him, Take thy bill, and having sat down write fifty. 7‘Afterward to another he said, And thou, how much dost thou owe? and he said, A hundred cors of wheat; and he saith to him, Take thy bill, and write eighty. 8‘And the lord commended the unrighteous steward that he did prudently, because the sons of this age are more prudent than the sons of the light, in respect to their generation. 9and I say to you, Make to yourselves friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye may fail, they may receive you to the age-during tabernacles."
Luke,16,10,"He who is faithful in the least, is also faithful in much; and he who in the least is unrighteous, is also unrighteous in much; 11if, then, in the unrighteous mammon ye became not faithful—the true who will entrust to you? 12and if in the other’s ye became not faithful—your own, who shall give to you? 13‘No domestic is able to serve two lords, for either the one he will hate, and the other he will love; or one he will hold to, and of the other he will be heedless; ye are not able to serve God and mammon.’ The Law and the Prophets"
Luke,16,14,"And also the Pharisees, being lovers of money, were hearing all these things, and were deriding him, 15and he said to them, ‘Ye are those declaring yourselves righteous before men, but God doth know your hearts; because that which among men is high, is abomination before God; 16the law and the prophets are till John; since then the reign of God is proclaimed good news, and every one doth press into it; 17and it is easier to the heaven and the earth to pass away, than of the law one tittle to fall. 18‘Every one who is sending away his wife, and marrying another, doth commit adultery; and every one who is marrying her sent away from a husband doth commit adultery. The Rich Man and Lazarus (John 5:39–47) 19‘And—a certain man was rich, and was clothed in purple and fine linen, making merry sumptuously every day, 20and there was a certain poor man, by name Lazarus, who was laid at his porch, full of sores, 21and desiring to be filled from the crumbs that are falling from the table of the rich man; yea, also the dogs, coming, were licking his sores. 22‘And it came to pass, that the poor man died, and that he was carried away by the messengers to the bosom of Abraham—and the rich man also died, and was buried; 23and in the hades having lifted up his eyes, being in torments, he doth see Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom, 24and having cried, he said, Father Abraham, deal kindly with me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and may cool my tongue, because I am distressed in this flame. 25‘And Abraham said, Child, remember that thou did receive—thou—thy good things in thy life, and Lazarus in like manner the evil things, and now he is comforted, and thou art distressed; 26and besides all these things, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that they who are willing to go over from hence unto you are not able, nor do they from thence to us pass through. 27‘And he said, I pray thee, then, father, that thou mayest send him to the house of my father, 28for I have five brothers, so that he may thoroughly testify to them, that they also may not come to this place of torment. 29‘Abraham saith to him, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them; 30and he said, No, father Abraham, but if any one from the dead may go unto them, they"

Luke,17,1,"And he said unto the disciples, ‘It is impossible for the stumbling blocks not to come, but woe to him through whom they come; 2it is more profitable to him if a weighty millstone is put round about his neck, and he hath been cast into the sea, than that he may cause one of these little ones to stumble. 3‘Take heed to yourselves, and, if thy brother may sin in regard to thee, rebuke him, and if he may reform, forgive him, 4and if seven times in the day he may sin against thee, and seven times in the day may turn back to thee, saying, I reform; thou shalt forgive him.’ The Power of Faith (Matthew 17:19–20)"
Luke,17,5,"And the apostles said to the Lord, ‘Add to us faith;’ 6and the Lord said, ‘If ye had faith as a grain of mustard, ye would have said to this sycamine, Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed you. 7‘But, who is he of you—having a servant ploughing or feeding—who, to him having come in out of the field, will say, Having come near, recline at meat? 8but will not rather say to him, Prepare what I may sup, and having girded thyself about, minister to me, till I eat and drink, and after these things"

Luke,20,27,"And certain of the Sadducees, who are denying that there is a rising again, having come near, questioned him, 28saying, ‘Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any one’s brother may die, having a wife, and he may die childless—that his brother may take the wife, and may raise up seed to his brother. 29‘There were, then, seven brothers, and the first having taken a wife, died childless, 30and the second took the wife, and he died childless, 31and the third took her, and in like manner also the seven—they left not children, and they died; 32and last of all died also the woman: 33in the rising again, then, of which of them doth she become wife?—for the seven had her as wife.’"
Luke,20,34,"And Jesus answering said to them, ‘The sons of this age do marry and are given in marriage, 35but those accounted worthy to obtain that age, and the rising again that is out of the dead, neither marry, nor are they given in marriage; 36for neither are they able to die any more—for they are like messengers—and they are sons of God, being sons of the rising again. 37‘And that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the Bush, since he doth call the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; 38and He is not a God of dead men, but of living, for all live to Him.’"

Luke,21,1,"And having looked up, he saw those who did cast their gifts to the treasury—rich men, 2and he saw also a certain poor widow casting there two mites, 3and he said, ‘Truly I say to you, that this poor widow did cast in more than all; 4for all these out of their superabundance did cast into the gifts to God, but this one out of her want, all the living that she had, did cast in.’ Temple Destruction and Other Signs (Matthew 24:1–8; Mark 13:1–8)"

The Destruction of Jerusalem (Matthew 24:15–25; Mark 13:14–23) 20‘And when ye may see Jerusalem surrounded by encampments, then know that come nigh did her desolation; 21then those in Judea, let them flee to the mountains; and those in her midst, let them depart out; and those in the countries, let them not come in to her; 22because these are days of vengeance, to fulfil all things that have been written. 23‘And woe to those with child, and to those giving suck, in those days; for there shall be great distress on the land, and wrath on this people; 24and they shall fall by the mouth of the sword, and shall be led captive to all the nations, and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by nations, till the times of nations be fulfilled.

Luke,21,29,"And he spake a simile to them: ‘See the fig-tree, and all the trees, 30when they may now cast forth, having seen, of yourselves ye know that now is the summer nigh; 31so also ye, when ye may see these things happening, ye know that near is the reign of God; 32verily I say to you—This generation may not pass away till all may have come to pass; 33the heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words may not pass away. Be Watchful for the Day 34‘And take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts may be weighed down with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day may come on you, 35for as a snare it shall come on all those dwelling on the face of all the land, 36watch ye, then, in every season, praying that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that are about to come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.’"

John,2,23,"And as he was in Jerusalem, in the passover, in the feast, many believed in his name, beholding his signs that he was doing; 24and Jesus himself was not trusting himself to them, because of his knowing all men, 25and because he had no need that any should testify concerning man, for he himself was knowing what was in man."

John,3,9,"Nicodemus answered and said to him, ‘How are these things able to happen?’"

John,3,17,"For God did not send His Son to the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him; 18he who is believing in him is not judged, but he who is not believing hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19‘And this is the judgment, that the light hath come to the world, and men did love the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil; 20for every one who is doing wicked things hateth the light, and doth not come unto the light, that his works may not be detected; 21but he who is doing the truth doth come to the light, that his works may be manifested, that in God they are having been wrought.’ John’s Testimony about Jesus"
John,3,22,"After these things came Jesus and his disciples to the land of Judea, and there he did tarry with them, and was baptizing; 23and John was also baptizing in Aenon, nigh to Salem, because there were many waters there, and they were coming and were being baptized— 24for John was not yet cast into the prison— 25there arose then a question from the disciples of John with some Jews about purifying, 26and they came unto John, and said to him, ‘Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou"
John,3,27,"John answered and said, ‘A man is not able to receive anything, if it may not have been given him from the heaven; 28ye yourselves do testify to me that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am having been sent before him; 29he who is having the bride is bridegroom, and the friend of the bridegroom, who is standing and hearing him, with joy doth rejoice because of the voice of the bridegroom; this, then, my joy hath been fulfilled. 30‘Him it behoveth to increase, and me to become less; 31he who from above is coming is above all; he who is from the earth, from the earth he is, and from the earth he speaketh; he who from the heaven is coming is above all. 32‘And what he hath seen and heard this he doth testify, and his testimony none receiveth; 33he who is receiving his testimony did seal that God is true; 34for he whom God sent, the sayings of God he speaketh; for not by measure doth God give the Spirit; 35the Father doth love the Son, and all things hath given into his hand; 36he who is believing in the Son, hath life age-during; and he who is not believing the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God doth remain upon him.’"

John,4,5,"He cometh, therefore, to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the place that Jacob gave to Joseph his son; 6and there was there a well of Jacob. Jesus therefore having been weary from the journeying, was sitting thus on the well; it was as it were the sixth hour; 7there cometh a woman out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith to her, ‘Give me to drink;’ 8for his disciples were gone away to the city, that they may buy victuals; 9the Samaritan woman therefore saith to him, ‘How dost thou, being a Jew, ask drink from me, being a Samaritan woman?’ for Jews"
John,4,10,"Jesus answered and said to her, ‘If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked him, and he"

John,4,12,"Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who did give us the well, and himself out of it did drink, and his sons, and his cattle?’"
John,4,13,"Jesus answered and said to her, ‘Every one who is drinking of this water shall thirst again; 14but whoever may drink of the water that I will give him, may not thirst—to the age; and the water that I will give him shall become in him a well of water, springing up to life age-during.’"
John,4,15,"The woman saith unto him, ‘Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.’"
John,4,16,"Jesus saith to her, ‘Go, call thy husband, and come hither;’ 17the woman answered and said, ‘I have not a husband.’ Jesus saith to her, ‘Well didst thou say—A husband I have not; 18for five husbands"
John,4,19,"The woman saith to him, ‘Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet; 20our fathers in this mountain did worship,"
John,4,21,"Jesus saith to her, ‘Woman, believe me, that there doth come an hour, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father; 22ye worship what ye have not known; we worship what we have known, because the salvation is of the Jews; 23but, there cometh an hour, and it now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father also doth seek such to worship"

John,4,38,"I sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured; others laboured, and ye into their labour have entered. Many Samaritans Believe"
John,4,39,"And from that city many believed in him, of the Samaritans, because of the word of the woman"
John,4,40,"When, then, the Samaritans came unto him, they were asking him to remain with them, and he remained there two days; 41and many more did believe because of his word, 42and said to the woman—‘No more because of thy speaking do we believe; for we ourselves have heard and known that this is truly the Saviour of the world—the Christ.’ Jesus Heals the Official’s Son (Matthew 8:5–13; Luke 7:1–10)"
John,4,43,"And after the two days he went forth thence, and went away to Galilee, 44for Jesus himself testified that a prophet in his own country shall not have honour; 45when then, he came to Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all things that he did in Jerusalem in the feast—for they also went to the feast."
John,4,46,"Jesus came, therefore, again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine, and there was a certain courtier, whose son was ailing in Capernaum, 47he, having heard that Jesus is come out of Judea to Galilee, went away unto him, and was asking him that he may come down and may heal his"
John,4,48,"Jesus then said unto him, ‘If signs and wonders ye may not see, ye will"
John,4,49,"The courtier saith unto him, ‘Sir, come down before my child die;’"
John,4,50,"Jesus saith to him, ‘Be going on; thy son doth live.’ And the man believed the word that Jesus said to him, and was going on, 51and he now going down, his servants met him, and told, saying—‘Thy child doth live;’ 52he inquired then of them the hour in which he became better, and they said to him—‘Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him;’ 53then the father knew that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him—‘Thy son doth live,’ and he himself believed, and his whole house; 54this again a second sign did Jesus, having come out of Judea to Galilee."
John,5,1,"After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, 2and there is in Jerusalem by the sheep -gate a pool that is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches, 3in these were lying a great multitude of the ailing, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water, 4for a messenger at a set time was going down in the pool, and was troubling the water, the first then having gone in after the troubling of the water, became whole of whatever sickness he was held. 5and there was a certain man there being in ailment thirty and eight years, 6him Jesus having seen lying, and having known that he is already a long time, he saith to him, ‘Dost thou"
John,5,7,"The ailing man answered him, ‘Sir, I have no man, that, when the water may be troubled, he may put me into the pool, and while I am coming, another doth go down before me.’"
John,5,8,"Jesus saith to him, ‘Rise, take up thy couch, and be walking;’ 9and immediately the man became whole, and he took up his couch, and was walking, and it was a sabbath on that day, 10the Jews then"
John,5,11,"He answered them, ‘He who made me whole—that one said to me, Take up thy couch, and be walking;’ 12they questioned him, then, ‘Who is the man who is saying to thee, Take up thy couch and be walking?’"
John,5,13,"But he that was healed had not known who he is, for Jesus did move away, a multitude being in the"
John,5,14,"After these things, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, ‘Lo, thou hast become"
John,5,15,"The man went away, and told the Jews that it is Jesus who made him whole, The Father and the Son 16and because of this were the Jews persecuting Jesus, and seeking to kill him, because these things"
John,5,17,"And Jesus answered them, ‘My Father till now doth work, and I work;’ 18because of this, then, were the Jews seeking the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the sabbath, but he also called God his own Father, making himself equal to God."
John,5,19,"Jesus therefore responded and said to them, ‘Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son is not able to do anything of himself, if he may not see the Father doing anything; for whatever things He may do, these also the Son in like manner doth; 20for the Father doth love the Son, and doth shew to him all things that He himself doth; and greater works than these He will shew him, that ye may wonder. 21‘For, as the Father doth raise the dead, and doth make alive, so also the Son doth make alive whom he willeth; 22for neither doth the Father judge any one, but all the judgment He hath given to the Son, 23that all may honour the Son according as they honour the Father; he who is not honouring the Son, doth not honour the Father who sent him. 24‘Verily, verily, I say to you—He who is hearing my word, and is believing Him who sent me, hath life age-during, and to judgment he doth not come, but hath passed out of the death to the life. 25‘Verily, verily, I say to you—There cometh an hour, and it now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those having heard shall live; 26for, as the Father hath life in himself, so He gave also to the Son to have life in himself, 27and authority He gave him also to do judgment, because he is Son of Man. 28‘Wonder not at this, because there doth come an hour in which all those in the tombs shall hear his voice, 29and they shall come forth; those who did the good things to a rising again of life, and those who practised the evil things to a rising again of judgment. 30‘I am not able of myself to do anything; according as I hear I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me. Testimonies about Jesus 31‘If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true; 32another there is who is testifying concerning me, and I have known that the testimony that he doth testify concerning me is true; 33ye have sent unto John, and he hath testified to the truth. 34‘But I do not receive testimony from man, but these things I say that ye may be saved; 35he was the burning and shining lamp, and ye did will to be glad, for an hour, in his light. 36‘But I have the testimony greater than John’s, for the works that the Father gave me, that I might finish them, the works themselves that I do, they testify concerning me, that the Father hath sent me. 37‘And the Father who sent me Himself hath testified concerning me; ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor His appearance have ye seen; 38and His word ye have not remaining in you, because whom He sent, him ye do not believe. The Witness of Scripture (Luke 16:19–31) 39‘Ye search the Writings, because ye think in them to have life age-during, and these are they that are testifying concerning me; 40and ye do not will to come unto me, that ye may have life; 41glory from man I do not receive, 42but I have known you, that the love of God ye have not in yourselves. 43‘I have come in the name of my Father, and ye do not receive me; if another may come in his own name, him ye will receive; 44how are ye able—ye—to believe, glory from one another receiving, and the glory that is from God alone ye seek not? 45‘Do not think that I will accuse you unto the Father; there is who is accusing you, Moses—in whom ye have hoped; 46for if ye were believing Moses, ye would have been believing me, for he wrote concerning me; 47but if his writings ye believe not, how shall ye believe my sayings?’"
John,6,1,"After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee (of Tiberias), 2and there was following him a great multitude, because they were seeing his signs that he was doing on the ailing; 3and Jesus went up to the mount, and he was there sitting with his disciples, 4and the passover was nigh, the"

John,6,22,"On the morrow, the multitude that was standing on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other little boat there except one—that into which his disciples entered—and that Jesus went not in with his disciples into the little boat, but his disciples went away alone, 23(and other little boats came from Tiberias, nigh the place where they did eat the bread, the Lord having given thanks), 24when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they also themselves did enter into the boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus; 25and having found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, ‘Rabbi, when hast thou come hither?’"
John,6,26,"Jesus answered them and said, ‘Verily, verily, I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were satisfied; 27work not for the food that is perishing, but for the food that is remaining to life age-during, which the Son of Man will give to you, for him did the"

John,6,35,"And Jesus said to them, ‘I am the bread of the life; he who is coming unto me may not hunger, and he who is believing in me may not thirst—at any time; 36but I said to you, that ye also have seen me, and ye believe not; 37all that the Father doth give to me will come unto me; and him who is coming unto me, I may in no wise cast without, 38because I have come down out of the heaven, not that I may do my will, but the will of Him who sent me. 39‘And this is the will of the Father who sent me, that all that He hath given to me I may not lose of it, but may raise it up in the last day; 40and this is the will of Him who sent me, that every one who is beholding the Son, and is believing in him, may have life age-during, and I will raise him up in the last day.’"

John,6,61,"And Jesus having known in himself that his disciples are murmuring about this, said to them, ‘Doth this stumble you? 62if then ye may behold the Son of Man going up where he was before? 63the spirit it is that is giving life; the flesh doth not profit anything; the sayings that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life; 64but there are certain of you who do not believe;’ for Jesus had known from the beginning who they are who are not believing, and who is he who will deliver him up, 65and he said, ‘Because of this I have said to you—No one is able to come unto me, if it may not have been given him from my Father.’"
John,6,66,"From this time many of his disciples went away backward, and were no more walking with him, Peter’s Confession of Faith (Matthew 16:13–20; Mark 8:27–30; Luke 9:18–20)"

John,7,1,"And Jesus was walking after these things in Galilee, for he did not wish to walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him, 2and the feast of the Jews was nigh—that of tabernacles— 3his brethren, therefore, said unto him, ‘Remove hence, and go away to Judea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works that thou dost; 4for no one in secret doth anything, and himself seeketh to be in public; if thou dost these things—manifest thyself to the world;’ 5for not even were his brethren believing in him."

John,7,14,"And it being now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up to the temple, and he was teaching, 15and"
John,7,16,"Jesus answered them and said, ‘My teaching is not mine, but His who sent me; 17if any one may will to do His will, he shall know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God, or—I do speak from myself. 18‘He who is speaking from himself his own glory doth seek, but he who is seeking the glory of him who sent him, this one is true, and unrighteousness is not in him;"

John,19,12,"From this time was Pilate seeking to release him, and the Jews were crying out, saying, ‘If this one thou mayest release, thou art not a friend of Caesar; every one making himself a king, doth speak against Caesar.’"
John,19,13,"Pilate, therefore, having heard this word, brought Jesus without—and he sat down upon the tribunal—to a place called, ‘Pavement,’ and in Hebrew, Gabbatha; 14and it was the preparation of the passover, and as it were the sixth hour, and he saith to the Jews, ‘Lo, your king!’ 15and they cried out, ‘Take away, take away, crucify him;’ Pilate saith to them, ‘Your king shall I crucify?’ the chief priests answered, ‘We have no king except Caesar.’ The Crucifixion (Psalm 22:1–31; Matthew 27:32–44; Mark 15:21–32; Luke 23:26–43)"
John,19,16,"Then, therefore, he delivered him up to them, that he may be crucified, and they took Jesus and led him away, 17and bearing his cross, he went forth to the place called Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha; 18where they crucified him, and with him two others, on this side, and on that side, and"
John,19,19,"And Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross, and it was written, ‘Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews;’ 20this title, therefore, read many of the Jews, because the place was nigh to the city where Jesus was crucified, and it was having been written in Hebrew, in Greek, in"

The Death of Jesus (Psalm 22:1–31; Matthew 27:45–56; Mark 15:33–41; Luke 23:44–49)"
John,19,28,"After this, Jesus knowing that all things now have been finished, that the Writing may be fulfilled, saith, ‘I thirst;’ 29a vessel, therefore, was placed full of vinegar, and they having filled a sponge with vinegar, and having put it around a hyssop stalk, did put it to his mouth; 30when, therefore, Jesus received the vinegar, he said, ‘It hath been finished;’ and having bowed the head, gave up the spirit.

John,19,31,"The Jews, therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, since it was the preparation, (for that sabbath day was a great one,) asked of Pilate that their legs may be broken, and"
John,19,32,"The soldiers, therefore, came, and of the first indeed they did break the legs, and of the other who was crucified with him, 33and having come to Jesus, when they saw him already having been dead, they did not break his legs; 34but one of the soldiers with a spear did pierce his side, and immediately there came forth blood and water; 35and he who hath seen hath testified, and his testimony is true, and that one hath known that true things he speaketh, that ye also may believe."
John,19,36,"For these things came to pass, that the Writing may be fulfilled, ‘A bone of him shall not be broken;’ 37and again another Writing saith, ‘They shall look to him whom they did pierce.’ The Burial of Jesus (Isaiah 53:9–12; Matthew 27:57–61; Mark 15:42–47; Luke 23:50–56)"

Acts,5,3,"And Peter said, ‘Ananias, wherefore did the Adversary fill thy heart, for thee to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back of the price of the place? 4while it remained, did it not remain thine? and having been sold, in thy authority was it not? why is it that thou didst put in thy heart this thing? thou didst not lie to men, but to God;’ 5and Ananias hearing these words, having fallen down, did expire, and great fear came upon all who heard these things, 6and having risen, the younger men wound him up, and having carried forth, they buried him."
Acts,5,7,"And it came to pass, about three hours after, that his wife, not knowing what hath happened, came in, 8and Peter answered her, ‘Tell me if for so much ye sold the place;’ and she said, ‘Yes, for so much.’"
Acts,5,9,"And Peter said unto her, ‘How was it agreed by you, to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? lo, the feet of those who did bury thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee forth;’ 10and she fell down presently at his feet, and expired, and the young men having come in, found her dead, and having carried forth, they buried her by her husband; 11and great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who heard these things. The Apostles Heal Many"
Acts,5,12,"And through the hands of the apostles came many signs and wonders among the people, and they were with one accord all in the porch of Solomon; 13and of the rest no one was daring to join himself to them, but the people were magnifying them, 14(and the more were believers added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women,) 15so as into the broad places to bring forth the ailing, and to lay them upon couches and mats, that at the coming of Peter, even his shadow might overshadow some one of them; 16and there were coming together also the people of the cities round about to Jerusalem, bearing ailing persons, and those harassed by unclean spirits—who were all healed. The Apostles Arrested and Freed"
Acts,5,17,"And having risen, the chief priest, and all those with him—being the sect of the Sadducees—were filled with zeal, 18and laid their hands upon the apostles, and did put them in a public prison; 19and a messenger of the Lord through the night opened the doors of the prison, having also brought them forth, he said, 20‘Go on, and standing, speak in the temple to the people all the sayings of this life;’ 21and having heard, they did enter at the dawn into the temple, and were teaching. And the chief priest having come, and those with him, they called together the sanhedrim and all the senate of the sons of Israel, and they sent to the prison to have them brought, 22and the officers having come, did not find them in the prison, and having turned back, they told, 23saying—‘The prison indeed we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors, and having opened—within we found no one.’ The Apostles before the Sanhedrin"
Acts,5,24,"And as the priest, and the magistrate of the temple, and the chief priests, heard these words, they were doubting concerning them to what this would come; 25and coming near, a certain one told them, saying—‘Lo, the men whom ye did put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people;’ 26then the magistrate having gone away with officers, brought them without violence, for they were fearing the people, lest they should be stoned; 27and having brought them, they set them in the sanhedrim, and the chief priest questioned them, 28saying, ‘Did not we strictly command you not to teach in this name? and lo, ye have filled Jerusalem"
Acts,5,29,"And Peter and the apostles answering, said, ‘To obey God it behoveth, rather than men; 30and the God of our fathers did raise up Jesus, whom ye slew, having hanged upon a tree; 31this one God, a Prince and a Saviour, hath exalted with His right hand, to give reformation to Israel, and forgiveness of sins; 32and we are His witnesses of these sayings, and the Holy Spirit also, whom God gave to those obeying him.’ Gamaliel’s Advice"
Acts,5,33,"And they having heard, were cut to the heart, and were taking counsel to slay them, 34but a certain one, having risen up in the sanhedrim—a Pharisee, by name Gamaliel, a teacher of law honoured by all the people—commanded to put the apostles forth a little, 35and said unto them, ‘Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves about these men, what ye are about to do, 36for before these days rose up Theudas, saying, that himself was some one, to whom a number of men did join themselves, as it were four hundred, who was slain, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered, and came to nought. 37‘After this one rose up, Judas the Galilean, in the days of the enrolment, and drew away much people after him, and that one perished, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered; 38and now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone, because if this counsel or this work may be of men, it will be overthrown, 39and if it be of God, ye are not able to overthrow it, lest perhaps also ye be found fighting against God.’"
Acts,5,40,"And to him they agreed, and having called near the apostles, having beaten them, they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go; 41they, indeed, then, departed from the presence of the sanhedrim, rejoicing that for his name they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour, 42every day also in the temple, and in every house, they were not ceasing teaching and proclaiming good news—Jesus the Christ."
Acts,6,1,"And in these days, the disciples multiplying, there came a murmuring of the Hellenists at the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily ministration, 2and the twelve, having called near the multitude of the disciples, said, ‘It is not pleasing that we, having left the word of God, do minister at tables; 3look out, therefore, brethren, seven men of you who are well testified of, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may set over this necessity, 4and we to prayer, and to the"
Acts,6,5,"And the thing was pleasing before all the multitude, and they did choose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch, 6whom they did set before the apostles, and they, having prayed, laid on them their hands."
Acts,6,7,"And the word of God did increase, and the number of the disciples did multiply in Jerusalem exceedingly; a great multitude also of the priests were obedient to the faith. The Arrest of Stephen"
Acts,6,8,"And Stephen, full of faith and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people, 9and there arose certain of those of the synagogue, called of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia, and Asia, disputing with Stephen, 10and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking; 11then they suborned men, saying—‘We have heard"
Acts,6,12,"They did stir up also the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and having come upon him, they caught him, and brought him to the sanhedrim; 13they set up also false witnesses, saying, ‘This one doth not cease to speak evil sayings against this holy place and the law, 14for we have heard him saying, That this Jesus the Nazarean shall overthrow this place, and shall change the customs that Moses delivered to us;’ 15and gazing at him, all those sitting in the sanhedrim saw his face as it were the face of a messenger."
Acts,7,1,"And the chief priest said, ‘Are then these things so?’ 2and he said, ‘Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken: The God of the glory did appear to our father Abraham, being in Mesopotamia, before his dwelling in Haran, 3and He said to him, Go forth out of thy land, and out of thy kindred, and come to a land that I shall shew thee. 4‘Then having come forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Haran, and from thence, after the death of his father, He did remove him to this land wherein ye now dwell, 5and He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a footstep, and did promise to give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him—he having no child. 6‘And God spake thus, That his seed shall be sojourning in a strange land, and they shall cause it to serve, and shall do it evil four hundred years, 7and the nation whom they shall serve I will judge,"
Acts,7,8,"And He gave to him a covenant of circumcision, and so he begat Isaac, and did circumcise him on the eighth day, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob—the twelve patriarchs; Joseph Sold into Egypt (Genesis 37:12–30) 9and the patriarchs, having been moved with jealousy, sold Joseph to Egypt, and God was with him, 10and did deliver him out of all his tribulations, and gave him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he did set him—governor over Egypt and all his house. 11‘And there came a dearth upon all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great tribulation, and our fathers were not finding sustenance, 12and Jacob having heard that there was corn in Egypt, sent forth our fathers a first time; 13and at the second time was Joseph made known to his brethren, and Joseph’s kindred became manifest to Pharaoh, 14and Joseph having sent, did call for his father Jacob, and all his kindred—with seventy and five souls— Israel Oppressed in Egypt (Exodus 1:8–22) 15and Jacob went down to Egypt, and died, himself and our fathers, 16and they were carried over into Sychem, and were laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in money from the sons of Emmor, of Sychem. 17‘And according as the time of the promise was drawing nigh, which God did swear to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt, 18till another king rose, who had not known Joseph; 19this one, having dealt subtilely with our kindred, did evil to our fathers, causing to expose their babes, that they might not live; The Birth and Adoption of Moses (Exodus 2:1–10; Hebrews 11:23–29) 20in which time Moses was born, and he was fair to God, and he was brought up three months in the house of his father; 21and he having been exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took him up, and did rear him to herself for a son; 22and Moses was taught in all wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in words and in works. The Rejection and Flight of Moses (Exodus 2:11–22) 23‘And when forty years were fulfilled to him, it came upon his heart to look after his brethren, the sons of Israel; 24and having seen a certain one suffering injustice, he did defend, and did justice to the oppressed, having smitten the Egyptian; 25and he was supposing his brethren to understand that God through his hand doth give salvation; and they did not understand. 26‘On the succeeding day, also, he shewed himself to them as they are striving, and urged them to peace, saying, Men, brethren are ye, wherefore do ye injustice to one another? 27and he who is doing injustice to the neighbour, did thrust him away, saying, Who set thee a ruler and a judge over us? 28to kill me dost thou wish, as thou didst kill yesterday the Egyptian? 29‘And Moses fled at this word, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons, The Call of Moses (Exodus 3:1–22) 30and forty years having been fulfilled, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai a messenger of the Lord, in a flame of fire of a bush, 31and Moses having seen did wonder at the sight;"
Acts,7,32,"I am the God of thy fathers; the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. ‘And Moses having become terrified, durst not behold, 33and the Lord said to him, Loose the sandal of thy feet, for the place in which thou hast stood is holy ground; 34seeing I have seen the affliction of My people that is in Egypt, and their groaning I did hear, and came down to deliver them; and now come, I will send thee to Egypt. 35‘This Moses, whom they did refuse, saying, Who did set thee a ruler and a judge? this one God a ruler and a redeemer did send, in the hand of a messenger who appeared to him in the bush; 36this one did bring them forth, having done wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years; 37this is the Moses who did say to the sons of Israel: A prophet to you shall the Lord your God raise up out of your brethren, like to me, him shall ye hear. 38‘This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the messenger who is speaking to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers who did receive the living oracles to give to us; The Rebellion of Israel (Exodus 32:1–35; Deuteronomy 9:7–29; Amos 5:16–27) 39to whom our fathers did not wish to become obedient, but did thrust away, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt, 40saying to Aaron, Make to us gods who shall go on before us, for this Moses, who brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, we have not known what hath happened to him. 41‘And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands, 42and God did turn, and did give them up to do service to the host of the heaven, according as it hath been written in the scroll of the prophets: Slain beasts and sacrifices did ye offer to Me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel? 43and ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan—the figures that ye made to bow before them, and I will remove your dwelling beyond Babylon. The Tabernacle of the Testimony (Exodus 40:1–33; Hebrews 9:1–10) 44‘The tabernacle of the testimony was among our fathers in the wilderness, according as He did direct, who is speaking to Moses, to make it according to the figure that he had seen; 45which also our fathers having in succession received, did bring in with Joshua, into the possession of the nations whom God did drive out from the presence of our fathers, till the days of David, 46who found favour before God, and requested to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob; 47and Solomon built Him an house. 48‘But the Most High in sanctuaries made with hands doth not dwell, according as the prophet saith:"
Acts,7,49,"The heaven is My throne, and the earth My footstool; what house will ye build to Me? saith the Lord, or what is the place of My rest? 50hath not My hand made all these things? 51‘Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and in ears! ye do always the Holy Spirit resist; as your fathers—also ye; 52which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed those who declared before about the coming of the Righteous One, of whom now ye betrayers and murderers have become, 53who received the law by arrangement of messengers, and did not keep it.’ The Stoning of Stephen"
Acts,7,54,"And hearing these things, they were cut to the hearts, and did gnash the teeth at him; 55and being full of the Holy Spirit, having looked stedfastly to the heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, 56and he said, ‘Lo, I see the heavens having been opened, and the"
Acts,7,57,"And they, having cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and did rush with one accord upon him, 58and having cast him forth outside of the city, they were stoning him—and the witnesses did put down their garments at the feet of a young man called Saul— 59and they were stoning Stephen, calling and saying, ‘Lord Jesus, receive my spirit;’ 60and having bowed the knees, he cried with a loud voice, ‘Lord, mayest thou not lay to them this sin;’ and this having said, he fell asleep."
Acts,8,1,"And Saul was assenting to his death, and there came in that day a great persecution upon the assembly in Jerusalem, all also were scattered abroad in the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles; 2and devout men carried away Stephen, and made great lamentation over him; 3and Saul was making havoc of the assembly, into every house entering, and haling men and women, was giving them up to prison; Philip in Samaria"
Acts,8,5,"And Philip having gone down to a city of Samaria, was preaching to them the Christ, 6the multitudes also were giving heed to the things spoken by Philip, with one accord, in their hearing and seeing the signs that he was doing, 7for unclean spirits came forth from many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice, and many who have been paralytic and lame were healed, 8and there was great joy in that city. Simon the Sorcerer (Deuteronomy 18:9–14)"
Acts,8,9,"And a certain man, by name Simon, was before in the city using magic, and amazing the nation of Samaria, saying himself to be a certain great one, 10to whom they were all giving heed, from small unto great, saying, ‘This one is the great power of God;’ 11and they were giving heed to him, because"

Acts,10,38,"Jesus who is from Nazareth—how God did anoint him with the Holy Spirit and power; who went through, doing good, and healing all those oppressed by the devil, because God was with him; 39and we—we are witnesses of all things that he did, both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem,—whom they did slay, having hanged upon a tree. 40‘This one God did raise up the third day, and gave him to become manifest, 41not to all the people, but to witnesses, to those having been chosen before by God—to us who did eat with him, and did drink with him, after his rising out of the dead; 42and he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify fully that it is he who hath been ordained by God judge of living and dead— 43to this one do all the prophets testify, that through his name every one that is believing in him doth receive remission of sins.’ The Gentiles Receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 19:1–7)"
Acts,10,44,"While Peter is yet speaking these sayings, the Holy spirit fell upon all those hearing the word, 45and those of the circumcision believing were astonished—as many as came with Peter—because also upon the nations the gift of the Holy Spirit hath been poured out, 46for they were hearing them speaking"
Acts,10,47,"Then answered Peter, ‘The water is any one able to forbid, that these may not be baptized, who the Holy Spirit did receive—even as also we?’ 48he commanded them also to be baptized in the name of the Lord; then they besought him to remain certain days."

Acts,11,27,"And in those days there came from Jerusalem prophets to Antioch, 28and one of them, by name Agabus, having stood up, did signify through the Spirit a great dearth is about to be throughout all the world—which also came to pass in the time of Claudius Caesar— 29and the disciples, according as any one was prospering, determined each of them to send for ministration to the brethren dwelling in Judea, 30which also they did, having sent unto the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul."
Acts,12,1,"And about that time, Herod the king put forth his hands, to do evil to certain of those of the assembly, 2and he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword, 3and having seen that it is pleasing to the Jews, he added to lay hold of Peter also—and they were the days of the unleavened food— 4whom also having seized, he did put in prison, having delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him, intending after the passover to bring him forth to the people. The Rescue of Peter"
Acts,12,5,"Peter, therefore, indeed, was kept in the prison, and fervent prayer was being made by the assembly unto God for him, 6and when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night was Peter sleeping between two soldiers, having been bound with two chains, guards also before the door were keeping the prison, 7and lo, a messenger of the Lord stood by, and a light shone in the buildings, and having smitten Peter"
Acts,12,8,"The messenger also said to him, ‘Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals;’ and he did so; and he saith to him, ‘Put thy garment round and be following me;’ 9and having gone forth, he was following him, and he knew not that it is true that which is done through the messenger, and was thinking he saw a vision, 10and having passed through a first ward, and a second, they came unto the iron gate that is leading to the city, which of its own accord did open to them, and having gone forth, they went on through"
Acts,12,11,"And Peter having come to himself, said, ‘Now I have known of a truth that the Lord did sent forth His messenger, and did deliver me out of the hand of Herod, and all the expectation of the people of the Jews;’ 12also, having considered, he came unto the house of Mary, the mother of John, who is surnamed Mark, where there were many"

Acts,12,18,"And day having come, there was not a little stir among the soldiers what then was become of Peter, 19and Herod having sought for him, and not having found, having examined the guards, did command them to be led away to punishment, and having gone down from Judea to Caesarea, he was abiding there. The Death of Herod"
Acts,12,20,"And Herod was highly displeased with the Tyrians and Sidonians, and with one accord they came unto him, and having made a friend of Blastus, who is over the bed-chambers of the king, they were asking peace, because of their country being nourished from the king’s; 21and on a set day, Herod having arrayed himself in kingly apparel, and having sat down upon the tribunal, was making an oration unto them, 22and the populace were shouting, ‘The voice of a god, and not of a man;’ 23and presently there smote him a messenger of the Lord, because he did not give the glory to God, and having been eaten of worms, he expired."

On Cyprus"
Acts,13,4,"These, indeed, then, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, thence also they sailed to Cyprus, 5and having come unto Salamis, they declared the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they had also John as a ministrant; 6and having gone through the island unto Paphos, they found a certain magian, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name is Bar-Jesus; 7who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man; this one having called for Barnabas and Saul, did desire to hear the word of God, 8and there withstood them Elymas the magian—for so is his name"
Acts,13,9,"And Saul—who also is Paul—having been filled with the Holy Spirit, and having looked stedfastly on him, 10said, ‘O full of all guile, and all profligacy, son of a devil, enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease perverting the right ways of the Lord? 11and now, lo, a hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season;’ and presently there fell upon him a mist and darkness, and he, going about, was seeking some to lead him by the hand; 12then the proconsul having seen what hath come to pass, did believe, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord. In Pisidian Antioch"
Acts,13,13,"And those about Paul having set sail from Paphos, came to Perga of Pamphylia, and John having departed from them, did turn back to Jerusalem, 14and they having gone through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia, and having gone into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, they sat down, 15and after the reading of the law and of the prophets, the chief men of the synagogue sent unto them,"
Acts,13,16,"And Paul having risen, and having beckoned with the hand, said, ‘Men, Israelites, and those fearing God, hearken: 17the God of this people Israel did choose our fathers, and the people He did exalt in their sojourning in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm did He bring them out of it; 18and about a period of forty years He did suffer their manners in the wilderness, 19and having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He did divide by lot to them their land. 20‘And after these things, about four hundred and fifty years, He gave judges—till Samuel the prophet; 21and thereafter they asked for a king, and God did give to them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years; 22and having removed him, He did raise up to them David for king, to whom also having testified, he said, I found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who shall do all My will. 23‘Of this one’s"
Acts,13,24,"John having first preached, before his coming, a baptism of reformation to all the people of Israel; 25and as John was fulfilling the course, he said, Whom me do ye suppose to be?

Acts,13,33,"God hath in full completed this to us their children, having raised up Jesus, as also in the second Psalm it hath been written, My Son thou art—I to-day have begotten thee. 34‘And that He did raise him up out of the dead, no more to return to corruption, he hath said thus—I will give to you the faithful kindnesses of David; 35wherefore also in another place he saith, Thou shalt not give Thy kind One to see corruption, 36for David, indeed, his own generation having served by the will of God, did fall asleep, and was added unto his fathers, and saw corruption, 37but he whom God did raise up, did not see corruption. 38‘Let it therefore be known to you, men, brethren, that through this one to you is the forgiveness of sins declared, 39and from all things from which ye were not able in the law of Moses to be declared righteous, in this one every one who is believing is declared righteous; 40see, therefore, it may not come upon you that hath been spoken in the prophets:"

Acts,13,42,"And having gone forth out of the synagogue of the Jews, the nations were calling upon them that on the next sabbath these sayings may be spoken to them, 43and the synagogue having been dismissed, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes did follow Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, were persuading them to remain in the grace of God."

Acts,14,1,"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they did enter together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spake, so that there believed both of Jews and Greeks a great multitude; 2and the unbelieving Jews did stir up and made evil the souls of the nations against the brethren; 3long time, indeed, therefore, did they abide speaking boldly in the Lord, who is testifying to the word of His grace, and granting"
Acts,14,4,"And the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews, and some with the apostles, 5and when there was a purpose both of the nations and of the Jews with their rulers to use them despitefully, and to stone them, 6they having become aware, did flee to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and to the region round about, 7and there they were proclaiming good news. The Visit to Lystra and Derbe"
Acts,14,8,"And a certain man in Lystra, impotent in the feet, was sitting, being lame from the womb of his mother—who never had walked, 9this one was hearing Paul speaking, who, having stedfastly beheld him, and having seen that he hath faith to be saved, 10said with a loud voice, ‘Stand up on thy feet upright;’ and he was springing and walking, 11and the multitudes having seen what Paul did, did lift up their voice, in the speech of Lycaonia, saying, ‘The gods, having become like men, did come down unto us;’ 12they were calling also Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes, since he was the leader in speaking."
Acts,14,13,"And the priest of the Zeus that is before their city, oxen and garlands unto the porches having brought, with the multitudes did wish to sacrifice, 14and having heard, the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having rent their garments, did spring into the multitude, crying 15and saying, ‘Men, why these things do ye? and we are men like-affected with you, proclaiming good news to you, from these vanities to turn unto the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the things in them; 16who in the past generations did suffer all the nations to go on in their ways, 17though, indeed, without witness He did not leave himself, doing good—from heaven giving rains to us, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness;’ 18and these things saying, scarcely did they restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them."
Acts,14,19,"And there came thither, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews, and they having persuaded the multitudes, and having stoned Paul, drew him outside of the city, having supposed him to be dead; 20and the disciples having surrounded him, having risen he entered into the city, and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe. Strengthening the Disciples"
Acts,14,21,"Having proclaimed good news also to that city, and having discipled many, they turned back to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch, 22confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting to remain in the faith, and that through many tribulations it behoveth us to enter into the reign of God, 23and having appointed to them by vote elders in every assembly, having prayed with fastings, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed."
Acts,14,24,"And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia, 25and having spoken in Perga the word, they went down to Attalia, 26and thence did sail to Antioch, whence they had been given by the grace of God for the work that they fulfilled; 27and having come and gathered together the assembly, they declared as many things as God did with them, and that He did open to the nations a door of faith; 28and they abode there not a little time with the disciples."
Acts,15,1,"And certain having come down from Judea, were teaching the brethren—‘If ye be not circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye are not able to be saved;’ 2there having been, therefore, not a little dissension and disputation to Paul and Barnabas with them, they arranged for Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, to go up unto the apostles and elders to Jerusalem about this question, 3they indeed, then, having been sent forward by the assembly, were passing through Phenice and Samaria,"
Acts,15,4,"And having come to Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly, and the apostles, and the elders, they declared also as many things as God did with them; The Council at Jerusalem (Amos 9:11–15; Galatians 2:1–10) 5and there rose up certain of those of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying—‘It behoveth to circumcise them, to command them also to keep the law of Moses.’"
Acts,15,6,"And there were gathered together the apostles and the elders, to see about this matter, 7and there having been much disputing, Peter having risen up said unto them, ‘Men, brethren, ye know that from former days, God among us did make choice, through my mouth, for the nations to hear the word of the good news, and to believe; 8and the heart-knowing God did bare them testimony, having given to them the Holy Spirit, even as also to us, 9and did put no difference also between us and them, by the faith having purified their hearts; 10now, therefore, why do ye tempt God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 11but, through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe to be saved, even as also they.’"
Acts,15,12,"And all the multitude did keep silence, and were hearkening to Barnabas and Paul, declaring as many signs and wonders as God did among the nations through them;"
Acts,15,14,"Simeon did declare how at first God did look after to take out of the nations a people for His name, 15and to this agree the words of the prophets, as it hath been written:"
Acts,15,16,"After these things I will turn back, and I will build again the tabernacle of David, that is fallen down, and its ruins I will build again, and will set it upright— 17that the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the nations, upon whom My name hath been called, saith the Lord, who is doing all these things. 18‘Known from the ages to God are all His works; 19wherefore I judge: not to trouble those who from the nations do turn back to God, 20but to write to them to abstain from the pollutions of the idols, and the whoredom, and the strangled thing; and the blood; 21for Moses from former generations in every city hath those preaching him—in the synagogues every sabbath being read.’ The Letter to the Gentile Believers"
Acts,15,22,"Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, chosen men out of themselves to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas—Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren— 23having written through their hand thus: ‘The apostles, and the elders, and the brethren, to those in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, brethren, who are of the nations, greeting; 24seeing we have heard that certain having gone forth from us did trouble you with words, subverting your souls, saying to be circumcised and to keep the law, to whom we did give no charge, 25it seemed good to us, having come together with one accord, chosen men to send unto you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul— 26men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ— 27we have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, and they by word are telling the same things. 28‘For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, no more burden to lay upon you, except these necessary things: 29to abstain from things offered to idols, and blood, and a strangled thing, and whoredom; from which keeping yourselves, ye shall do well; be strong!’ The Believers at Antioch Rejoice"

Acts,15,37,"And Barnabas counselled to take with them John called Mark, 38and Paul was not thinking it good to take him with them who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work; 39there came, therefore, a sharp contention, so that they were parted from one another, and Barnabas having taken Mark, did sail to Cyprus, 40and Paul having chosen Silas, went forth, having been given up to the grace of God by the brethren; 41and he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the assemblies."
Acts,16,1,"And he came to Derbe and Lystra, and lo, a certain disciple was there, by name Timotheus son of a certain woman, a believing Jewess, but of a father, a Greek, 2who was well testified to by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium; 3this one did Paul wish to go forth with him, and having taken him, he circumcised him, because of the Jews who are in those places, for they all knew his father—that he"

Acts,16,9,"And a vision through the night appeared to Paul—a certain man of Macedonia was standing, calling upon him, and saying, ‘Having passed through to Macedonia, help us;’— 10and when he saw the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go forth to Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord hath called us to preach good news to them, Lydia’s Conversion in Philippi (Revelation 2:18–29) 11having set sail, therefore, from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, on the morrow also to Neapolis, 12thence also to Philippi, which is a principal city of the part of Macedonia—a colony. And we were in this city abiding certain days, 13on the sabbath-day also we went forth outside of the city, by a river, where there used to be prayer, and having sat down, we were speaking to the women who came together, 14and a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, was hearing, whose heart the Lord did open to attend to the things spoken by Paul; 15and when she was baptized, and her household, she did call upon us, saying, ‘If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, having entered into my house, remain;’ and she constrained us. Paul and Silas Imprisoned"
Acts,16,16,"And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain maid, having a spirit of Python, did meet us, who brought much employment to her masters by soothsaying, 17she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying, ‘These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us a way of salvation;’ 18and this she was doing for many days, but Paul having been grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, ‘I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come forth from her;’ and it came forth the same hour."
Acts,16,19,"And her masters having seen that the hope of their employment was gone, having caught Paul and Silas, drew them to the market-place, unto the rulers, 20and having brought them to the magistrates, they said, ‘These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews; 21and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.’"
Acts,16,22,"And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates having torn their garments from them, were commanding to beat them with rods, 23many blows also having laid upon them, they cast them to prison, having given charge to the jailor to keep them safely, 24who such a charge having received, did put them to the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks. The Conversion of the Jailer"
Acts,16,25,"And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were hearing them, 26and suddenly a great earthquake came, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, opened also presently were all the doors, and of all—the bands were loosed; 27and the jailor having come out of sleep, and having seen the doors of the prison open, having drawn a sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to be fled, 28and Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, ‘Thou"
Acts,16,29,"And, having asked for a light, he sprang in, and trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas, 30and having brought them forth, said, ‘Sirs, what must I do—that I may be saved?’ 31and they said, ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved—thou and thy house;’ 32and they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all those in his household; 33and having taken them, in that hour of the night, he did bathe them from the blows, and was baptized, himself and all his presently, 34having brought them also into his house, he set food before them, and was glad with all the household, he having believed in God. An Official Apology"
Acts,16,35,"And day having come, the magistrates sent the rod-bearers, saying, ‘Let those men go;’ 36and the jailor told these words unto Paul—‘The magistrates have sent, that ye may be let go; now, therefore, having gone forth go on in peace;’ 37and Paul said to them, ‘Having beaten us publicly uncondemned— men, Romans being—they did cast us to prison, and now privately do they cast us forth! why no! but"

Acts,17,10,"And the brethren immediately, through the night, sent forth both Paul and Silas to Berea, who having come, went to the synagogue of the Jews; 11and these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, they received the word with all readiness of mind, every day examining the Writings whether those things were so; 12many, indeed, therefore, of them did believe, and of the honourable Greek women"

Acts,17,18,"And certain of the Epicurean and of the Stoic philosophers, were meeting together to see him, and some were saying, ‘What would this seed picker wish to say?’ and others, ‘Of strange demons he doth seem to be an announcer;’ because Jesus and the rising again he did proclaim to them as good news, 19having also taken him, unto the Areopagus they brought him, saying, ‘Are we able to know what is this new teaching that is spoken by thee, 20for certain strange things thou dost bring to our ears? we wish, then, to know what these things would wish to be;’ 21and all Athenians, and the strangers sojourning, for nothing else were at leisure but to say something, and to hear some newer thing. Paul’s Address in the Areopagus"
Acts,17,22,"And Paul, having stood in the midst of the Areopagus, said, ‘Men, Athenians, in all things I perceive you as over-religious; 23for passing through and contemplating your objects of worship, I found also an erection on which had been inscribed: To God—unknown; whom, therefore—not knowing—ye do worship, this One I announce to you. 24‘God, who did make the world, and all things in it, this One, of heaven and of earth being Lord, in temples made with hands doth not dwell, 25neither by the hands"
Acts,17,26,"He made also of one blood every nation of men, to dwell upon all the face of the earth—having ordained times before appointed, and the bounds of their dwellings— 27to seek the Lord, if perhaps they did feel after Him and find,—though, indeed, He is not far from each one of us, 28for in Him we live, and move, and are; as also certain of your poets have said: For of Him also we are offspring. 29‘Being, therefore, offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead to be like to gold, or silver, or stone, graving of art and device of man; 30the times, indeed, therefore, of the ignorance God having overlooked, doth now command all men everywhere to reform, 31because He did set a day in which He is about to judge the world in righteousness, by a man whom He did ordain, having given assurance to all, having raised him out of the dead.’"
Acts,17,32,"And having heard of a rising again of the dead, some, indeed, were mocking, but others said, ‘We will hear thee again concerning this;’ 33and so Paul went forth from the midst of them, 34and certain men having cleaved to him, did believe, among whom is also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman, by name Damaris, and others with them."
Acts,18,1,"And after these things, Paul having departed out of Athens, came to Corinth, 2and having found a certain Jew, by name Aquilas, of Pontus by birth, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife—because of Claudius having directed all the Jews to depart out of Rome—he came to them, 3and because of being of the same craft, he did remain with them, and was working, for they were tent-makers as to craft; 4and he was reasoning in the synagogue every sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks."
Acts,18,5,"And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the Spirit, testifying fully to the Jews Jesus the Christ; 6and on their resisting and speaking evil, having shaken his garments, he said unto them, ‘Your blood is upon your head—I am clean; henceforth to the nations"

Paul before Gallio"
Acts,18,12,"And Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a rush with one accord upon Paul, and brought him unto the tribunal, 13saying—‘Against the law this one doth persuade men to worship God;’ 14and Paul being about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, ‘If, indeed, then, it was anything unrighteous, or an act of wicked profligacy, O Jews, according to reason I had borne with you, 15but if it is a question concerning words and names, and of your law, look ye yourselves to it, for a judge of these things I do not wish to be,’ 16and he drave them from the tribunal; 17and all the Greeks having taken Sosthenes, the chief man of the synagogue, were beating him before the tribunal, and not even for these things was Gallio caring. Paul Returns to Antioch"
Acts,18,18,"And Paul having remained yet a good many days, having taken leave of the brethren, was sailing to Syria—and with him are Priscilla and Aquilas—having shorn his head in Cenchera, for he had a vow; 19and he came down to Ephesus, and did leave them there, and he himself having entered into the synagogue did reason with the Jews: 20and they having requested him to remain a longer time with them, he did not consent, 21but took leave of them, saying, ‘It behoveth me by all means the coming feast to keep at Jerusalem, and again I will return unto you—God willing.’ And he sailed from Ephesus, 22and having come down to Caesarea, having gone up, and having saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch.

Acts,18,24,"And a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, a man of eloquence, being mighty in the Writings, came to Ephesus, 25this one was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in the Spirit, was speaking and teaching exactly the things about the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John; 26this one also began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and Aquilas and Priscilla having heard of him, took him to them, and did more exactly expound to him the way of God, 27and he being minded to go through into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples, having exhorted them to receive him, who having come, did help them much who have believed through the grace, 28for powerfully the Jews he was refuting publicly, shewing through the Writings Jesus to be the Christ."
Acts,19,1,"And it came to pass, in Apollos’ being in Corinth, Paul having gone through the upper parts, came to Ephesus, and having found certain disciples, 2he said unto them, ‘The Holy Spirit did ye receive—having believed?’ and they said unto him, ‘But we did not even hear whether there is any Holy Spirit;’ 3and he"

Acts,19,16,"And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaping upon them, and having overcome them, prevailed against them, so that naked and wounded they did flee out of that house, 17and this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who are dwelling at Ephesus, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified, 18many also of those who did believe were coming, confessing and declaring their acts, 19and many of those who had practised the curious arts, having brought the books together, were burning them before all; and they reckoned together the prices of them, and found it five myriads of silverlings; 20so powerfully was the word of God increasing and prevailing. The Riot in Ephesus"
Acts,19,21,"And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in the Spirit, having gone through Macedonia and Achaia, to go on to Jerusalem, saying—‘After my being there, it behoveth me also to see Rome;’ 22and having sent to Macedonia two of those ministering to him—Timotheus and Erastus—he himself stayed a time in Asia."
Acts,19,23,"And there came, at that time, not a little stir about the way, 24for a certain one, Demetrius by name, a worker in silver, making silver sanctuaries of Artemis, was bringing to the artificers gain not a little, 25whom, having brought in a crowd together, and those who did work about such things, he said, ‘Men, ye know that by this work we have our wealth; 26and ye see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but almost in all Asia, this Paul, having persuaded, did turn away a great multitude, saying, that they are not gods who are made by hands; 27and not only is this department in danger for us of coming into disregard, but also, that of the great goddess Artemis the temple is to be reckoned for nothing, and also her greatness is about to be brought down, whom all Asia and the world doth worship.’"
Acts,19,28,"And they having heard, and having become full of wrath, were crying out, saying, ‘Great is the Artemis of the Ephesians!’ 29and the whole city was filled with confusion, they rushed also with one accord into the theatre, having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul’s fellow-travellers."

Acts,19,35,"And the public clerk having quieted the multitude, saith, ‘Men, Ephesians, why, who is the man that doth not know that the city of the Ephesians is a devotee of the great goddess Artemis, and of that which fell down from Zeus? 36these things, then, not being to be gainsaid, it is necessary for you to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. 37‘For ye brought these men, who are neither temple- robbers nor speaking evil of your goddess; 38if indeed, therefore, Demetrius and the artificers with him with any one have a matter, court days are held, and there are proconsuls; let them accuse one another. 39‘And if ye seek after anything concerning other matters, in the legal assembly it shall be determined; 40for we are also in peril of being accused of insurrection in regard to this day, there being no occasion by which we shall be able to give an account of this concourse;’ 41and these things having said, he dismissed the assembly."
Acts,20,1,"And after the ceasing of the tumult, Paul having called near the disciples, and having embraced them, went forth to go on to Macedonia; 2and having gone through those parts, and having exhorted them with many words, he came to Greece; 3having made also three months’ stay—a counsel of the Jews having been against him—being about to set forth to Syria, there came to him a resolution of returning"

Paul’s Farewell to the Ephesians"
Acts,20,17,"And from Miletus, having sent to Ephesus, he called for the elders of the assembly, 18and when they were come unto him, he said to them, ‘Ye—ye know from the first day in which I came to Asia, how, with you at all times I was; 19serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and temptations, that befell me in the counsels of the Jews against me; 20how nothing I did keep back of what things are profitable, not to declare to you, and to teach you publicly, and in every house, 21testifying fully both to Jews and Greeks, toward God reformation, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 22‘And now, lo, I—bound in the Spirit—go on to Jerusalem, the things that shall befall me in it not knowing, 23save that the Holy Spirit in every city doth testify fully, saying, that for me bonds and tribulations remain; 24but I make account of none of these, neither do I count my life precious to myself, so that I finish my course with joy, and the ministration that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify fully the good news of the grace of God. 25‘And now, lo, I have known that no more shall ye see my face,—ye all among whom I did go preaching the reign of God; 26wherefore I take you to witness this day, that I am clear from the blood of all, 27for I did not keep back from declaring to you all the counsel of God. 28‘Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit made you overseers, to feed the assembly of God that He acquired through His own blood, 29for I have known this, that there shall enter in, after my departing, grievous wolves unto you, not sparing the flock, 30and of your own selves there shall arise men, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. 31‘Therefore, watch, remembering that three years, night and day, I did not cease with tears warning each one; 32and now, I commend you, brethren, to God, and to the word of His grace, that is able to build up, and to give you an inheritance among all those sanctified. 33‘The silver or gold or garments of no one did I covet; 34and ye yourselves know that to my necessities, and to those who were with me, minister did these hands; 35all things I did shew you, that, thus labouring, it behoveth us to partake with the ailing, to be mindful also of the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.’"
Acts,20,36,"And these things having said, having bowed his knees, with them all, he did pray, 37and there came a great weeping to all, and having fallen upon the neck of Paul, they were kissing him, 38sorrowing most of all for the word that he had said—that they are about no more to see his face; and they were accompanying him to the ship."

Acts,21,17,"And we having come to Jerusalem, the brethren did gladly receive us, 18and on the morrow Paul was going in with us unto James, all the elders also came, 19and having saluted them, he was declaring, one by one, each of the things God did among the nations through his ministration, 20and they having heard, were glorifying the Lord. They said also to him, ‘Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of Jews who have believed, and all are zealous of the law, 21and they are instructed concerning thee, that apostasy from Moses thou dost teach to all Jews among the nations, saying—Not to circumcise the children, nor after the customs to walk; 22what then is it? certainly the multitude it behoveth to come together, for they will hear that thou hast come. 23‘This, therefore, do that we say to thee: We have four men having a vow on themselves, 24these having taken, be purified with them, and be at expence with them, that they may shave the head, and all may know that the things of which they have been instructed concerning thee are nothing, but thou dost walk—thyself also—the law keeping. 25‘And concerning those of the nations who have believed, we have written, having given judgment, that they observe no such thing, except to keep themselves both from idol-sacrifices, and"

Acts,23,22,"The chief captain, then, indeed, let the young man go, having charged him to tell no one, ‘that these things thou didst shew unto me;’ Paul Sent to Felix 23and having called near a certain two of the centurions, he said, ‘Make ready soldiers two hundred, that they may go on unto Caesarea, and horsemen seventy, and spearmen two hundred, from the third hour of the night; 24beasts also provide, that, having set Paul on, they may bring him safe unto Felix the governor;’ 25he having written a letter after this description: 26‘Claudius Lysias, to the most noble governor Felix, hail:"
Acts,23,27,"This man having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them—having come with the soldiery, I rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman; 28and, intending to know the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their sanhedrim, 29whom I found accused concerning questions of their law, and having no accusation worthy of death or bonds; 30and a plot having been intimated to me against this man—about to be of the Jews—at once I sent unto thee, having given command also to the accusers to say the things against him before thee; be"
Acts,23,31,"Then, indeed, the soldiers according to that directed them, having taken up Paul, brought him through the night to Antipatris, 32and on the morrow, having suffered the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the castle; 33those having entered into Caesarea, and delivered the letter to the"
Acts,23,34,"And the governor having read it, and inquired of what province he is, and understood that he is from Cilicia; 35‘I will hear thee—said he—when thine accusers also may have come;’ he also commanded him to be kept in the praetorium of Herod."
Acts,24,1,"And after five days came down the chief priest Ananias, with the elders, and a certain orator— Tertullus, and they made manifest to the governor the things against Paul; 2and he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, ‘Much peace enjoying through thee, and worthy deeds being done to this nation through thy forethought, 3always, also, and everywhere we receive it, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness; 4and that I may not be further tedious to thee, I pray thee to hear us concisely in thy gentleness; 5for having found this man a pestilence, and moving a dissension to all the Jews through the world—a ringleader also of the sect of the Nazarenes— 6who also the temple did try to profane, whom also we took, and according to our law did wish to judge, 7and Lysias the chief captain having come near, with much violence, out of our hands did take away, 8having commanded his accusers to come to thee, from whom thou mayest be able, thyself having examined, to know concerning all these things of which we accuse him;’ 9and the Jews also agreed, professing these things to be so. Paul’s Defense to Felix"
Acts,24,10,"And Paul answered—the governor having beckoned to him to speak—‘Knowing that for many years thou hast been a judge to this nation, the more cheerfully the things concerning myself I do answer; 11thou being able to know that it is not more than twelve days to me since I went up to worship in Jerusalem, 12and neither in the temple did they find me reasoning with any one, or making a dissension of the multitude, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city; 13nor are they able to prove against me the things concerning which they now accuse me. 14‘And I confess this to thee, that, according to the way that they call a sect, so serve I the God of the fathers, believing all things that in the law and the prophets have been written, 15having hope toward God, which they themselves also wait for, that there is about to be a rising again of the dead, both of righteous and unrighteous; 16and in this I do exercise myself, to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always. 17‘And after many years I came, about to do kind acts to my nation, and offerings, 18in which certain Jews from Asia did find me purified in the temple, not with multitude, nor with tumult, 19whom it behoveth to be present before thee, and to accuse, if they had anything against me, 20or let these same say if they found any unrighteousness in me in my standing before the sanhedrim, 21except concerning this one voice, in which I cried, standing among them—Concerning a rising again of the dead I am judged to-day by you.’ The Verdict Postponed"
Acts,24,22,"And having heard these things, Felix delayed them—having known more exactly of the things concerning the way—saying, ‘When Lysias the chief captain may come down, I will know fully the things concerning you;’ 23having given also a direction to the centurion to keep Paul, to let him also have liberty, and to forbid none of his own friends to minister or to come near to him."
Acts,24,24,"And after certain days, Felix having come with Drusilla his wife, being a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith toward Christ, 25and he reasoning concerning righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment that is about to be, Felix, having become afraid, answered, ‘For the present be going, and having got time, I will call for thee;’ 26and at the same time also hoping that money shall be given to him by Paul, that he may release him, therefore, also sending for him the oftener, he was conversing with him; 27and two years having been fulfilled, Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus; Felix also willing to lay a favour on the Jews, left Paul bound."
Acts,25,1,"Festus, therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea, 2and the chief priest and the principal men of the Jews made manifest to him the things against Paul, and were calling on him, 3asking favour against him, that he may send for him to"
Acts,25,4,"Then, indeed, Festus answered that Paul is kept in Caesarea, and himself is about speedily to go on thither, 5‘Therefore those able among you—saith he—having come down together, if there be anything in this man—let them accuse him;’ 6and having tarried among them more than ten days, having gone down to Caesarea, on the morrow having sat upon the tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought; 7and he having come, there stood round about the Jews who have come down from Jerusalem—many and weighty charges they are bringing against Paul, which they were not able to prove, 8he making defence—‘Neither in regard to"
Acts,25,9,"And Festus willing to lay on the Jews a favour, answering Paul, said, ‘Art thou willing, to Jerusalem having gone up, there concerning these things to be judged before me?’ Paul Appeals to Caesar 10and Paul said, ‘At the tribunal of Caesar I am standing, where it behoveth me to be judged; to Jews I did no unrighteousness, as thou dost also very well know; 11for if indeed I am unrighteous, and anything worthy of death have done, I deprecate not to die; and if there is none of the things of which these accuse me, no one is able to make a favour of me to them; to Caesar I appeal!’ 12then Festus, having communed with the council, answered, ‘To Caesar thou hast appealed; to Caesar thou shalt go.’ Festus Consults Agrippa"
Acts,25,13,"And certain days having passed, Agrippa the king, and Bernice, came down to Caesarea saluting Festus, 14and as they were continuing there more days, Festus submitted to the king the things concerning Paul, saying, ‘There is a certain man, left by Felix, a prisoner, 15about whom, in my being at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid information, asking a decision against him, 16unto whom I answered, that it is not a custom of Romans to make a favour of any man to die, before that he who is accused may have the accusers face to face, and may receive place of defence"
Acts,25,17,"They, therefore, having come together—I, making no delay, on the succeeding day having sat upon the tribunal, did command the man to be brought, 18concerning whom the accusers, having stood up, were bringing against him no accusation of the things I was thinking of, 19but certain questions concerning their own religion they had against him, and concerning a certain Jesus who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive; 20and I, doubting in regard to the question concerning this, said, If he would wish to go on to Jerusalem, and there to be judged concerning these things— 21but Paul having appealed to be kept to the hearing of Sebastus, I did"
Acts,25,22,"And Agrippa said unto Festus, ‘I was wishing also myself to hear the man;’ and he said, ‘To-morrow thou shalt hear him;’ Paul before Agrippa and Bernice 23on the morrow, therefore—on the coming of Agrippa and Bernice with much display, and they having entered into the audience chamber, with the chief captains also, and the principal men of the city, and"
Acts,25,24,"And Festus said, ‘King Agrippa, and all men who are present with us, ye see this one, about whom all the multitude of the Jews did deal with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out, He ought not to live any longer; 25and I, having found him to have done nothing worthy of death, and he also himself having appealed to Sebastus, I decided to send him, 26concerning whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord, wherefore I brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that the examination having been made, I may have something to write; 27for it doth seem to me irrational, sending a prisoner, not also to signify the charges against him.’"
Acts,26,1,"And Agrippa said unto Paul, ‘It is permitted to thee to speak for thyself;’ then Paul having stretched forth the hand, was making a defence: 2‘Concerning all things of which I am accused by Jews, king Agrippa, I have thought myself happy, being about to make a defence before thee to-day, 3especially knowing thee to be acquainted with all things—both customs and questions—among Jews; wherefore, I beseech thee, patiently to hear me. 4‘The manner of my life then, indeed, from youth—which from the beginning was among my nation, in Jerusalem—know do all the Jews, 5knowing me before from the first, (if they may be willing to testify,) that after the most exact sect of our worship, I lived a Pharisee; 6and now for the hope of the promise made to the fathers by God, I have stood judged, 7to which our twelve tribes, intently night and day serving, do hope to come, concerning which hope I am accused, king Agrippa, by the Jews; 8why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?"
Acts,26,9,"I, indeed, therefore, thought with myself, that against the name of Jesus of Nazareth it behoved me many things to do, 10which also I did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I in prison did shut up, from the chief priests having received the authority; they also being put to death, I gave my vote against them, 11and in every synagogue, often punishing them, I was constraining them to speak evil, being also exceedingly mad against them, I was also persecuting them even unto strange cities. 12‘In which things, also, going on to Damascus—with authority and commission from the chief priests— 13at mid-day, I saw in the way, O king, out of heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me a light—and those going on with me; 14and we all having fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why me dost thou persecute? hard for thee against pricks to kick! 15‘And I said, Who art thou, Lord? and he said, I am Jesus whom thou dost persecute; 16but rise, and stand upon thy feet, for for this I appeared to thee, to appoint thee an officer and a witness both of the things thou didst see, and of the things in which I will appear to thee, 17delivering thee from the people, and the nations, to whom now I send thee, 18to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of the Adversary unto God, for their receiving forgiveness of sins, and a lot among those having been sanctified, by faith that is toward me. 19‘Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, 20but to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem, to all the region also of Judea, and to the nations, I was preaching to reform, and to turn back unto God, doing works worthy of reformation; 21because of these things the Jews—having caught me in the temple—were endeavouring to kill me. 22‘Having obtained, therefore, help from God, till this day, I have stood witnessing both to small and to great, saying nothing besides the things that both the prophets and Moses spake of as about to come, 23that the Christ is to suffer, whether first by a rising from the dead, he is about to proclaim light to the people and to the nations.’ Festus Interrupts Paul’s Defense"
Acts,26,24,"And, he thus making a defence, Festus with a loud voice said, ‘Thou art mad, Paul; much learning doth turn thee mad;’ 25and he saith, ‘I am not mad, most noble Festus, but of truth and soberness the sayings I speak forth; 26for the king doth know concerning these things, before whom also I speak boldly, for none of these things, I am persuaded, are hidden from him; for this thing hath not been done in a corner; 27thou dost believe, king Agrippa, the prophets? I have known that thou dost believe!’"
Acts,26,28,"And Agrippa said unto Paul, ‘In a little thou dost persuade me to become a Christian!’ 29and Paul said, ‘I would have wished to God, both in a little, and in much, not only thee, but also all those hearing me to-day, to become such as I also am—except these bonds.’"
Acts,26,30,"And, he having spoken these things, the king rose up, and the governor, Bernice also, and those sitting with them, 31and having withdrawn, they were speaking unto one another, saying—‘This man doth nothing worthy of death or of bonds;’ 32and Agrippa said to Festus, ‘This man might have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.’"
Acts,27,1,"And when our sailing to Italy was determined, they were delivering up both Paul and certain others, prisoners, to a centurion, by name Julius, of the band of Sebastus, 2and having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium, we, being about to sail by the coasts of Asia, did set sail, there being with us Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, 3on the next day also we touched at Sidon, and Julius, courteously"
Acts,27,4,"And thence, having set sail, we sailed under Cyprus, because of the winds being contrary, 5and having sailed over the sea over-against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myria of Lycia, 6and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria, sailing to Italy, did put us into it, 7and having sailed slowly many days, and with difficulty coming over-against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone, 8and hardly passing it, we came to a certain place called ‘Fair Havens,’ nigh to which was the city of Lasaea."
Acts,27,9,"And much time being spent, and the sailing being now dangerous—because of the fast also being already past—Paul was admonishing, 10saying to them, ‘Men, I perceive that with hurt, and much damage, not only of the lading and of the ship, but also of our lives—the voyage is about to be;’ 11but the centurion to the pilot and to the shipowner gave credence more than to the things spoken by Paul; 12and the haven being incommodious to winter in, the more part gave counsel to sail thence also, if by any means they might be able, having attained to Phenice, there to winter, which is a haven of Crete, looking to the south-west and north-west, The Storm at Sea (Jonah 1:4–10) 13and a south wind blowing softly, having thought they had obtained their purpose, having lifted anchor, they sailed close by Crete, 14and not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, that is called Euroclydon, 15and the ship being caught, and not being able to bear up against the wind, having given her up, we were borne on, 16and having run under a certain little isle, called Clauda, we were hardly able to become masters of the boat, 17which having taken up, they were using helps, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest"
Acts,27,18,"And we, being exceedingly tempest-tossed, the succeeding day they were making a clearing, 19and on the third day with our own hands the tackling of the ship we cast out, 20and neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and not a little tempest lying upon us, thenceforth all hope was taken away of our being saved."
Acts,27,21,"And there having been long fasting, then Paul having stood in the midst of them, said, ‘It behoved you, indeed, O men—having hearkened to me—not to set sail from Crete, and to save this hurt and damage; 22and now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall be no loss of life among you— but of the ship; 23for there stood by me this night a messenger of God—whose I am, and whom I serve— 24saying, Be not afraid Paul; before Caesar it behoveth thee to stand; and, lo, God hath granted to thee all those sailing with thee; 25wherefore be of good cheer, men! for I believe God, that so it shall be, even as it hath been spoken to me, 26and on a certain island it behoveth us to be cast.’ The Shipwreck"
Acts,27,27,"And when the fourteenth night came—we being borne up and down in the Adria—toward the middle of the night the sailors were supposing that some country drew nigh to them; 28and having sounded they found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther, and again having sounded, they found fifteen fathoms, 29and fearing lest on rough places we may fall, out of the stern having cast four"
Acts,27,30,"And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and having"
Acts,27,31,"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, ‘If these do not remain in the ship—ye are not able to be saved;’ 32then the soldiers did cut off the ropes of the boat, and suffered it to fall off."
Acts,27,33,"And till the day was about to be, Paul was calling upon all to partake of nourishment, saying, ‘Fourteen days to-day, waiting, ye continue fasting, having taken nothing, 34wherefore I call upon you to take nourishment, for this is for your safety, for of not one of you shall a hair from the head fall;’ 35and having said these things, and having taken bread, he gave thanks to God before all, and having broken it, he began to eat; 36and all having become of good cheer, themselves also took food, 37(and we were—all the souls in the ship—two hundred, seventy and six), 38and having eaten sufficient nourishment, they were lightening the ship, casting forth the wheat into the sea."
Acts,27,39,"And when the day came, they were not discerning the land, but a certain creek were perceiving having a beach, into which they took counsel, if possible, to thrust forward the ship, 40and the anchors having taken up, they were committing it to the sea, at the same time—having loosed the bands of the rudders, and having hoisted up the mainsail to the wind—they were making for the shore, 41and having fallen into a place of two seas, they ran the ship aground, and the fore-part, indeed, having stuck fast,"
Acts,27,42,"And the soldiers’ counsel was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one having swam out should escape, 43but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, hindered them from the counsel, and did command those able to swim, having cast themselves out first—to get unto the land, 44and the rest, some indeed upon boards, and some upon certain things of the ship; and thus it came to pass that all came safe unto the land."
Acts,28,1,"And having been saved, then they knew that the island is called Melita, 2and the foreigners were shewing us no ordinary kindness, for having kindled a fire, they received us all, because of the pressing rain, and because of the cold; 3but Paul having gathered together a quantity of sticks, and having laid"
Acts,28,4,"And when the foreigners saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said unto one another, ‘Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, having been saved out of the sea, the justice did not suffer to live;’ 5he then, indeed, having shaken off the beast into the fire, suffered no evil, 6and they were expecting him to be about to be inflamed, or to fall down suddenly dead, and they, expecting it a long time, and seeing nothing uncommon happening to him, changing their minds, said he was a god."
Acts,28,7,"And in the neighbourhood of that place were lands of the principal man of the island, by name Publius, who, having received us, three days did courteously lodge us; 8and it came to pass, the father of Publius with feverish heats and dysentery pressed, was laid, unto whom Paul having entered, and having prayed, having laid his hands on him, healed him; 9this, therefore, being done, the others also in the island having infirmities were coming and were healed; 10who also with many honours did honour us, and we setting sail—they were lading us with the things that were necessary. Paul Arrives in Italy"
Acts,28,11,"And after three months, we set sail in a ship (that had wintered in the isle) of Alexandria, with the sign Dioscuri, 12and having landed at Syracuse, we remained three days, 13thence having gone round, we came to Rhegium, and after one day, a south wind having sprung up, the second day we came to Puteoli; 14where, having found brethren, we were called upon to remain with them seven days, and thus to Rome we came; 15and thence, the brethren having heard the things concerning us, came forth to meet us, unto Appii Forum, and Three Taverns—whom Paul having seen, having given thanks to God, took courage. Paul Preaches at Rome (Isaiah 6:1–13)"
Acts,28,16,"And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered up the prisoners to the captain of the barrack, but Paul was suffered to remain by himself, with the soldier guarding him."
Acts,28,17,"And it came to pass after three days, Paul called together those who are the principal men of the Jews, and they having come together, he said unto them: ‘Men, brethren, I—having done nothing contrary to the people, or to the customs of the fathers—a prisoner from Jerusalem, was delivered up to the hands of the Romans; 18who, having examined me, were wishing to release me, because of their being no cause of death in me, 19and the Jews having spoken against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar—not as having anything to accuse my nation of; 20for this cause, therefore, I called for you to see and to speak with you, for because of the hope of Israel with this chain I am bound.’"
Acts,28,21,"And they said unto him, ‘We did neither receive letters concerning thee from Judea, nor did any one who came of the brethren declare or speak any evil concerning thee, 22and we think it good from thee to hear what thou dost think, for, indeed, concerning this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against;’ 23and having appointed him a day, they came, more of them unto him, to the lodging, to whom he was expounding, testifying fully the reign of God, persuading them also of the things concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and the prophets, from morning till evening, 24and, some, indeed, were"
Acts,28,25,"And not being agreed with one another, they were going away, Paul having spoken one word—‘Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers, 26saying, Go on unto this people and say, With hearing ye shall hear, and ye shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and ye shall not perceive, 27for made gross was the heart of this people, and with the ears they heard heavily, and their eyes they did close, lest they may see with the eyes, and with the heart may understand, and be turned back, and I may heal them. 28‘Be it known, therefore, to you, that to the nations was sent the salvation of God, these also will hear it;’ 29and he having said these things, the Jews went away, having much disputation among themselves; 30and Paul remained an entire two years in his own hired house, and was receiving all those coming in unto him, 31preaching the reign of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness—unforbidden."
Romans,1,1,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, having been separated to the good news of God— 2which He announced before through His prophets in holy writings— 3concerning His Son, (who is come of the seed of David according to the flesh, 4who is marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of sanctification, by the rising again from the dead,) Jesus Christ our Lord; 5through whom we did receive grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, in behalf of his name; 6among whom are also ye, the called of Jesus Christ; 7to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints; Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ! Unashamed of the Gospel 8first, indeed, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world; 9for God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you, 10always in my prayers beseeching, if by any means now at length I shall have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you, 11for I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that ye may be established; 12and that is, that I may be"

Romans,1,17,"For the righteousness of God in it is revealed from faith to faith, according as it hath been written, ‘And the righteous one by faith shall live,’ God’s Wrath against Sin 18for revealed is the wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety and unrighteousness of men, holding"
Romans,1,19,"Because that which is known of God is manifest among them, for God did manifest it to them, 20for the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, by the things made being understood, are plainly seen, both His eternal power and Godhead—to their being inexcusable; 21because, having known God they did not glorify Him as God, nor gave thanks, but were made vain in their reasonings, and their unintelligent heart was darkened, 22professing to be wise, they were made fools, 23and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of fowls, and of quadrupeds, and of reptiles."
Romans,1,24,"Wherefore also God did give them up, in the desires of their hearts, to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies among themselves; 25who did change the truth of God into a falsehood, and did honour and serve the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed to the ages. Amen."
Romans,1,26,"Because of this did God give them up to dishonourable affections, for even their females did change the natural use into that against nature; 27and in like manner also the males having left the natural use of the female, did burn in their longing toward one another; males with males working shame, and the recompense of their error that was fit, in themselves receiving."
Romans,1,28,"And, according as they did not approve of having God in knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mind, to do the things not seemly; 29having been filled with all unrighteousness, whoredom, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil dispositions; whisperers, 30evil-speakers, God-haters, insulting, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31unintelligent, faithless, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful; 32who the righteous judgment of God having known—that those practising such things are worthy of death—not only do them, but also have delight with those practising them."
Romans,2,1,"Therefore, thou art inexcusable, O man—every one who is judging—for in that in which thou dost judge the other, thyself thou dost condemn, for the same things thou dost practise who art judging, 2and we have known that the judgment of God is according to truth, upon those practising such things."
Romans,2,3,"And dost thou think this, O man, who art judging those who such things are practising, and art doing them, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? 4or the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, dost thou despise?—not knowing that the goodness of God doth lead thee to reformation! 5but, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou dost treasure up to thyself wrath, in a day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God, 6who shall render to each according to his works; 7to those, indeed, who in continuance of a good work, do seek glory, and honour, and incorruptibility—life age-during; 8and to those contentious, and disobedient, indeed, to the truth, and obeying the unrighteousness—indignation and wrath, 9tribulation and distress, upon every soul of man that is working the evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek; 10and glory, and honour,"
Romans,2,11,"For there is no acceptance of faces with God, 12for as many as without law did sin, without law also shall perish, and as many as did sin in law, through law shall be judged, 13for not the hearers of the law are righteous before God, but the doers"
Romans,2,14,"For, when nations that have not a law, by nature may do the things of the law, these not having a law—to themselves are a law; 15who do shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also witnessing with them, and between one another the thoughts accusing or else defending, 16in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my good news, through Jesus Christ. The Jews and the Law"
Romans,2,17,"Lo, thou art named a Jew, and dost rest upon the law, and dost boast in God, 18and dost know the will, and dost approve the distinctions, being instructed out of the law, 19and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of blind ones, a light of those in darkness, 20an instructor of foolish ones, a teacher"
Romans,2,21,"Thou, then, who art teaching another, thyself dost thou not teach? 22thou who art preaching not to steal, dost thou steal? thou who art saying not to commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou who art abhorring the idols, dost thou rob temples? 23thou who in the law dost boast, through the transgression of the law God dost thou dishonour? 24for the name of God because of you is evil spoken of among the nations, according as it hath been written."

Romans,2,26,"If, therefore the uncircumcision the righteousness of the law may keep, shall not his uncircumcision for circumcision be reckoned? 27and the uncircumcision, by nature, fulfilling the law, shall judge thee who, through letter and circumcision,"
Romans,2,28,"For he is not a Jew who is so outwardly, neither is circumcision that which is outward in flesh; 29but a Jew is he who is so inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart, in spirit, not in letter, of which the praise is not of men, but of God."
Romans,3,1,"What, then, is the superiority of the Jew? or what the profit of the circumcision? 2much in every way; for first, indeed, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God; 3for what, if certain were faithless? shall their faithlessness the faithfulness of god make useless? 4let it not be! and let God become true, and every man false, according as it hath been written, ‘That Thou mayest be declared righteous in Thy words, and mayest overcome in Thy being judged.’"
Romans,3,5,"And, if our unrighteousness God’s righteousness doth establish, what shall we say? is God unrighteous who is inflicting the wrath? (after the manner of a man I speak) 6let it not be! since how shall God judge the world? 7for if the truth of God in my falsehood did more abound to His glory, why yet am I also as a sinner judged? 8and not, as we are evil spoken of, and as certain affirm us to say—‘We may do the evil things, that the good ones may come?’ whose judgment is righteous. There Is No One Righteous (Psalm 14:1–7; Psalm 53:1–6; Isaiah 59:1–17)"
Romans,3,9,"What, then? are we better? not at all! for we did before charge both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin, 10according as it hath been written—‘There is none righteous, not even one;"
Romans,3,11,"There is none who is understanding, there is none who is seeking after God."
Romans,3,12,"All did go out of the way, together they became unprofitable, there is none doing good, there is not even one."
Romans,3,13,A sepulchre opened is their throat; with their tongues they used deceit; poison of asps is under their lips.
Romans,3,14,Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
Romans,3,15,Swift are their feet to shed blood.
Romans,3,16,Ruin and misery are in their ways.
Romans,3,17,And a way of peace they did not know.
Romans,3,18,There is no fear of God before their eyes.’
Romans,3,19,"And we have known that as many things as the law saith, to those in the law it doth speak, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may come under judgment to God; 20wherefore by works of law shall no flesh be declared righteous before Him, for through law is a knowledge of sin. Righteousness through Faith in Christ (Philippians 3:1–11)"
Romans,3,21,"And now apart from law hath the righteousness of God been manifested, testified to by the law and the prophets, 22and the righteousness of God is through the faith of Jesus Christ to all, and upon all those believing,—for there is no difference, 23for all did sin, and are come short of the glory of God— 24being declared righteous freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 25whom God did set forth a mercy seat, through the faith in his blood, for the shewing forth of His righteousness, because of the passing over of the bygone sins in the forbearance of God— 26for the shewing forth of His righteousness in the present time, for His being righteous, and declaring him righteous who is of the faith of Jesus."
Romans,3,27,"Where then is the boasting? it was excluded; by what law? of works? no, but by a law of faith:"
Romans,3,29,"The God of Jews only is He, and not also of nations? 30yes, also of nations; since one is God who shall declare righteous the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through the faith."
Romans,3,31,"Law then do we make useless through the faith? let it not be! yea, we do establish law."
Romans,4,1,"What, then, shall we say Abraham our father, to have found, according to flesh? 2for if Abraham by works was declared righteous, he hath to boast—but not before God; 3for what doth the writing say? ‘And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him—to righteousness;’ 4and to him who is working, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt; 5and to him who is not working, and is believing upon Him who is declaring righteous the impious, his faith is reckoned—to righteousness: 6even as David also doth speak of the happiness of the man to whom God doth reckon righteousness apart from works: 7‘Happy they whose lawless acts were forgiven, and whose sins were covered; 8happy the man to whom the Lord may not reckon sin.’"
Romans,4,9,"Is this happiness, then, upon the circumcision, or also upon the uncircumcision—for we say that the faith was reckoned to Abraham—to righteousness? 10how then was it reckoned? he being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision; 11and a sign he did receive of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith in the uncircumcision, for his being father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for the righteousness also being reckoned to them, 12and father of circumcision to those not of circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of the faith, that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham. Abraham Receives the Promise (Genesis 15:8–21)"
Romans,4,13,"For not through law is the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, of his being heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith; 14for if they who are of law are heirs, the faith hath been made void, and the promise hath been made useless; 15for the law doth work wrath; for where law is not, neither is transgression."
Romans,4,16,"Because of this it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, for the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that which is of the law only, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, 17who is father of us all (according as it hath been written—‘A father of many nations I have set thee,’) before Him whom he did believe—God, who is quickening the dead, and is calling the things that be not as"
Romans,4,18,"Who, against hope in hope did believe, for his becoming father of many nations according to that spoken: ‘So shall thy seed be;’ 19and not having been weak in the faith, he did not consider his own body, already become dead, (being about a hundred years old,) and the deadness of Sarah’s womb, 20and at the promise of God did not stagger in unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, having given glory to God, 21and having been fully persuaded that what He hath promised He is able also to"
Romans,4,23,"And it was not written on his account alone, that it was reckoned to him, 24but also on ours, to whom it is about to be reckoned—to us believing on Him who did raise up Jesus our Lord out of the dead, 25who was delivered up because of our offences, and was raised up because of our being declared righteous."
Romans,5,1,"Having been declared righteous, then, by faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2through whom also we have the access by the faith into this grace in which we have stood,"
Romans,5,3,"And not only so, but we also boast in the tribulations, knowing that the tribulation doth work endurance; 4and the endurance, experience; and the experience, hope; 5and the hope doth not make ashamed, because the love of God hath been poured forth in our hearts through the Holy Spirit that hath been given to us. Christ’s Sacrifice for the Ungodly (John 3:1–21)"
Romans,5,6,"For in our being still ailing, Christ in due time did die for the impious; 7for scarcely for a righteous man will any one die, for for the good man perhaps some one also doth dare to die; 8and God doth commend His own love to us, that, in our being still sinners, Christ did die for us; 9much more, then, having been declared righteous now in his blood, we shall be saved through him from the wrath; 10for if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having"
Romans,5,11,"And not only so, but we are also boasting in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we did receive the reconciliation; Death in Adam, Life in Christ (Genesis 3:1–7) 12because of this, even as through one man the sin did enter into the world, and through the sin the death; and thus to all men the death did pass through, for that all did sin; 13for till law sin was in the world: and sin is not reckoned when there is not law; 14but the death did reign from Adam till Moses, even upon those not having sinned in the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is a type of him who is coming."
Romans,5,15,"But, not as the offence so also is the free gift; for if by the offence of the one the many did die, much more did the grace of God, and the free gift in grace of the one man Jesus Christ, abound to the many; 16and not as through one who did sin is the free gift, for the judgment indeed is of one to condemnation, but the gift is of many offences to a declaration of ‘Righteous,’ 17for if by the offence of the one the death did reign through the one, much more those, who the abundance of the grace and of the free gift of the righteousness are receiving, in life shall reign through the one—Jesus Christ."
Romans,5,18,"So, then, as through one offence to all men it is to condemnation, so also through one declaration of ‘Righteous’ it is to all men to justification of life; 19for as through the disobedience of the one man, the many were constituted sinners: so also through the obedience of the one, shall the many be"
Romans,5,20,"And law came in, that the offence might abound, and where the sin did abound, the grace did overabound, 21that even as the sin did reign in the death, so also the grace may reign, through righteousness, to life age-during, through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans,6,1,"What, then, shall we say? shall we continue in the sin that the grace may abound? 2let it not be! we who died to the sin—how shall we still live in it? 3are ye ignorant that we, as many as were baptized to Christ Jesus, to his death were baptized? 4we were buried together, then, with him through the baptism to the death, that even as Christ was raised up out of the dead through the glory of the Father,"
Romans,6,5,"For, if we have become planted together to the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of the rising again; 6this knowing, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of the sin may be made useless, for our no longer serving the sin; 7for he who hath died hath been set free from the sin."
Romans,6,8,"And if we died with Christ, we believe that we also shall live with him, 9knowing that Christ, having been raised up out of the dead, doth no more die, death over him hath no more lordship; 10for in that he died, to the sin he died once, and in that he liveth, he liveth to God; 11so also ye, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to the sin, and living to God in Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans,6,12,"Let not then the sin reign in your mortal body, to obey it in its desires; 13neither present ye your members instruments of unrighteousness to the sin, but present yourselves to God as living out of the dead, and your members instruments of righteousness to God; 14for sin over you shall not have lordship, for ye are not under law, but under grace. The Wages of Sin"
Romans,6,15,"What then? shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? let it not be! 16have ye not known that to whom ye present yourselves servants for obedience, servants ye are to him to whom ye obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness? 17and thanks to God, that ye were servants of the sin, and—were obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which ye were"
Romans,6,19,"In the manner of men I speak, because of the weakness of your flesh, for even as ye did present your members servants to the uncleanness and to the lawlessness—to the lawlessness, so now present your members servants to the righteousness—to sanctification, 20for when ye were servants of the sin, ye were free from the righteousness, 21what fruit, therefore,"
Romans,6,22,"And now, having been freed from the sin, and having become servants to God, ye have your fruit—to sanctification, and the end life age-during; 23for the wages of the sin is death, and the gift of God is life age-during in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans,7,1,"Are ye ignorant, brethren—for to those knowing law I speak—that the law hath lordship over the man as long as he liveth? 2for the married woman to the living husband hath been bound by law, and if the husband may die, she hath been free from the law of the husband; 3so, then, the husband being alive, an adulteress she shall be called if she may become another man’s; and if the husband may die, she is free from the law, so as not to be an adulteress, having become another man’s."
Romans,7,4,"So that, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of the Christ, for your becoming another’s, who out of the dead was raised up, that we might bear fruit to God; 5for when we were in the flesh, the passions of the sins, that are through the law, were working in our members, to bear fruit to the death; 6and now we have ceased from the law, that being dead in which we were held, so that we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter. God’s Law Is Holy"
Romans,7,7,"What, then, shall we say? the law is sin? let it not be! but the sin I did not know except through law, for also the covetousness I had not known if the law had not said: 8‘Thou shalt not covet;’ and the sin having received an opportunity, through the command, did work in me all covetousness—for apart"
Romans,7,9,"And I was alive apart from law once, and the command having come, the sin revived, and I died; 10and the command that is for life, this was found by me for death; 11for the sin, having received an opportunity, through the command, did deceive me, and through it did slay me; 12so that the law, indeed, is holy, and the command holy, and righteous, and good. Struggling with Sin"
Romans,7,13,"That which is good then, to me hath it become death? let it not be! but the sin, that it might appear sin, through the good, working death to me, that the sin might become exceeding sinful through the command, 14for we have known that the law is spiritual, and I am fleshly, sold by the sin; 15for that which I work,"
Romans,7,16,"And if what I do not will, this I do, I consent to the law that it is good, 17and now it is no longer I that work it, but the sin dwelling in me, 18for I have known that there doth not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh, good: for to will is present with me, and to work that which is right I do not find, 19for the good that I will, I do"
Romans,7,20,"And if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it, but the sin that is dwelling in me."
Romans,7,21,"I find, then, the law, that when I desire to do what is right, with me the evil is present, 22for I delight in the law of God according to the inward man, 23and I behold another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of the sin that is in my members."
Romans,7,24,A wretched man I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?
Romans,7,25,"I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord; so then, I myself indeed with the mind do serve the law of God, and with the flesh, the law of sin."
Romans,8,1,"There is, then, now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit; 2for the law of the Spirit of the life in Christ Jesus did set me free from the law of the sin and of the death; 3for what the law was not able to do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, His own Son having sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, did condemn the sin in the flesh, 4that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the"
Romans,8,5,"For those who are according to the flesh, the things of the flesh do mind; and those according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit; 6for the mind of the flesh is death, and the mind of the Spirit—life and peace; 7because the mind of the flesh is enmity to God, for to the law of God it doth not subject itself, 8for neither is it able; and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God."
Romans,8,9,"And ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God doth dwell in you; and if any one hath not the Spirit of Christ—this one is not His; 10and if Christ is in you, the body, indeed, is dead because of sin, and the Spirit is life because of righteousness, 11and if the Spirit of Him who did raise up Jesus out of the dead doth dwell in you, He who did raise up the Christ out of the dead shall quicken also your dying bodies, through His Spirit dwelling in you. Heirs with Christ"
Romans,8,12,"So, then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh; 13for if according to the flesh ye do live, ye are about to die; and if, by the Spirit, the deeds of the body ye put to death, ye shall live; 14for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God; 15for ye did not receive a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye did receive a spirit of adoption in which we cry, ‘Abba—"
Romans,8,16,"The Spirit himself doth testify with our spirit, that we are children of God; 17and if children, also heirs, heirs, indeed, of God, and heirs together of Christ—if, indeed, we suffer together, that we may also be glorified together. Future Glory (2 Corinthians 5:1–10)"
Romans,8,18,"For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory about to be revealed in us; 19for the earnest looking out of the creation doth expect the revelation of the sons of God; 20for to vanity was the creation made subject—not of its will, but because of Him who did subject it—in hope, 21that also the creation itself shall be set free from the servitude of the corruption to the liberty of the glory of the children of God; 22for we have known that all the creation"
Romans,8,23,"And not only so, but also we ourselves, having the first-fruit of the Spirit, we also ourselves in ourselves do groan, adoption expecting—the redemption of our body; 24for in hope we were saved, and hope beheld is not hope; for what any one doth behold, why also doth he hope for it? 25and if what we do not behold we hope for, through continuance we expect it."
Romans,8,26,"And, in like manner also, the Spirit doth help our weaknesses; for, what we may pray for, as it behoveth us, we have not known, but the Spirit himself doth make intercession for us with groanings unutterable, 27and He who is searching the hearts hath known what is the mind of the Spirit, because according to God he doth intercede for saints. God Works in All Things (Ephesians 1:3–14)"
Romans,8,28,"And we have known that to those loving God all things do work together for good, to those who are called according to purpose; 29because whom He did foreknow, He also did fore-appoint, conformed to the image of His Son, that he might be first-born among many brethren; 30and whom He did fore- appoint, these also He did call; and whom He did call, these also He declared righteous; and whom He declared righteous, these also He did glorify."
Romans,8,31,"What, then, shall we say unto these things? if God is for us, who is against us?"
Romans,8,32,"He who indeed His own Son did not spare, but for us all did deliver him up, how shall He not also with him the all things"
Romans,8,33,"Who shall lay a charge against the choice ones of God? God is He that is declaring righteous, 34who is he that is condemning? Christ is He that died, yea, rather also, was raised up; who is also on the right hand of God—who also doth intercede for us. More than Conquerors (Psalm 44:1–26)"
Romans,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ? tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36(according as it hath been written—‘For Thy sake we are put to death all the day long, we were reckoned as sheep of slaughter,’) 37but in all these we more than conquer, through him who loved us; 38for I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor messengers, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, 39nor things about to be, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of god, that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans,9,1,"Truth I say in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing testimony with me in the Holy Spirit, 2that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart— 3for I was wishing, I myself, to be anathema from the Christ—for my brethren, my kindred, according to the flesh, 4who are Israelites, whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the service, and the promises, 5whose are the fathers, and of whom is the Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed to the ages. Amen. God’s Sovereign Choice (Genesis 25:19–28; Malachi 1:1–5)"
Romans,9,6,"And it is not possible that the word of God hath failed; for not all who are of Israel are these Israel; 7nor because they are seed of Abraham are all children, but—‘in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee;’ 8that is, the children of the flesh—these are not children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for seed; 9for the word of promise is this; ‘According to this time I will come, and there shall"
Romans,9,10,"And not only so, but also Rebecca, having conceived by one—Isaac our father— 11(for they being not yet born, neither having done anything good or evil, that the purpose of God, according to choice, might remain; not of works, but of Him who is calling,) it was said to her— 12‘The greater shall serve the less;’ 13according as it hath been written, ‘Jacob I did love, and Esau I did hate.’"
Romans,9,14,"What, then, shall we say? unrighteousness is with God? let it not be! 15for to Moses He saith, ‘I will do kindness to whom I do kindness, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion;’ 16so, then—not of him who is willing, nor of him who is running, but of God who is doing kindness: 17for the Writing saith to Pharaoh—‘For this very thing I did raise thee up, that I might shew in thee My power, and that My name might be declared in all the land;’ 18so, then, to whom He willeth, He doth kindness, and to whom He willeth, He doth harden."
Romans,9,19,"Thou wilt say, then, to me, ‘Why yet doth He find fault? for His counsel who hath resisted?’ 20nay, but, O man, who art thou that art answering again to God? shall the thing formed say to Him who did form it, Why me didst thou make thus? 21hath not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same"
Romans,9,22,"And if God, willing to shew the wrath and to make known His power, did endure, in much long suffering, vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, 23and that He might make known the riches of His glory on vessels of kindness, that He before prepared for glory, whom also He did call—us— 24not only out of Jews, but also out of nations, 25as also in Hosea He saith, ‘I will call what is not My people—My people; and her not beloved— Beloved, 26and it shall be—in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not My people; there they shall be called sons of the living God.’"
Romans,9,27,"And Isaiah doth cry concerning Israel, ‘If the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved; 28for a matter He is finishing, and is cutting short in righteousness, because a matter cut short will the Lord do upon the land. 29and according as Isaiah saith before, ‘Except the Lord of Sabaoth did leave to us a seed, as Sodom we had become, and as Gomorrah we had been made like.’ Israel’s Unbelief"
Romans,9,30,"What, then, shall we say? that nations who are not pursuing righteousness did attain to righteousness, and righteousness that is of faith, 31and Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, at a law of righteousness did not arrive; 32wherefore? because—not by faith, but as by works of law; for they did stumble at the stone of stumbling, 33according as it hath been written, ‘Lo, I place in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence; and every one who is believing thereon shall not be ashamed.’"
Romans,10,1,"Brethren, the pleasure indeed of my heart, and my supplication that is to God for Israel, is—for salvation; 2for I bear them testimony that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, 3for not knowing the righteousness of God, and their own righteousness seeking to establish, to the"
Romans,10,4,"For Christ is an end of law for righteousness to every one who is believing, 5for Moses doth describe the righteousness that is of the law, that, ‘The man who did them shall live in them,’ 6and the righteousness of faith doth thus speak: ‘Thou mayest not say in thine heart, Who shall go up to the heaven,’ that is, Christ to bring down? 7or, ‘Who shall go down to the abyss,’ that is,"
Romans,10,8,"But what doth it say? ‘Nigh thee is the saying—in thy mouth, and in thy heart:’ that is, the saying of the faith, that we preach; 9that if thou mayest confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and mayest believe in thy heart that God did raise him out of the dead, thou shalt be saved, 10for with the heart doth one believe to righteousness, and with the mouth is confession made to salvation; 11for the Writing saith, ‘Every one who is believing on him shall not be ashamed,’ 12for there is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord of all is rich to all those calling upon Him, 13for every one—whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be saved.’"
Romans,10,14,"How then shall they call upon him in whom they did not believe? and how shall they believe on him of whom they did not hear? and how shall they hear apart from one preaching? 15and how shall they preach, if they may not be sent? according as it hath been written, ‘How beautiful the feet of those proclaiming good tidings of peace, of those proclaiming good tidings of the good things!’"
Romans,10,16,"But they were not all obedient to the good tidings, for Isaiah saith, ‘Lord, who did give credence to our report?’ 17so then the faith is by a report, and the report through a saying of God, 18but I say, Did they not hear? yes, indeed—‘to all the earth their voice went forth, and to the ends of the habitable world their sayings.’"
Romans,10,19,"But I say, Did not Israel know? first Moses saith, ‘I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation; by an unintelligent nation I will anger you,’ 20and Isaiah is very bold, and saith, ‘I was found by those not seeking Me; I became manifest to those not inquiring after Me;’ 21and unto Israel He saith, ‘All the day I did stretch out My hands unto a people unbelieving and gainsaying.’"

Romans,11,2,"God did not cast away His people whom He knew before; have ye not known—in Elijah—what the Writing saith? how he doth plead with God concerning Israel, saying, 3‘Lord, Thy prophets they did kill, and Thy altars they dug down, and I was left alone, and they seek my life;’ 4but what saith the divine answer to him? ‘I left to Myself seven thousand men, who did not"
Romans,11,5,"So then also in the present time a remnant according to the choice of grace there hath been; 6and if by grace, no more of works, otherwise the grace becometh no more grace; and if of works, it is no more grace, otherwise the work is no more work."
Romans,11,7,"What then? What Israel doth seek after, this it did not obtain, and the chosen did obtain, and the rest were hardened, 8according as it hath been written, ‘God gave to them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear,’—unto this very day, 9and David saith, ‘Let their table become for a snare, and for a trap, and for a stumbling-block, and for a recompense to them; 10let their eyes be darkened—not to behold, and their back do Thou always bow down.’ The Ingrafting of the Gentiles"

Romans,11,13,"For to you I speak— to the nations—inasmuch as I am indeed an apostle of nations, my ministration I do glorify; 14if by any means I shall arouse to jealousy mine own flesh, and shall save some of them, 15for if the casting away of them is a reconciliation of the world, what the reception—if not life out of the dead? 16and if the first-fruit is holy, the lump also; and if the root is holy, the branches also."
Romans,11,17,"And if certain of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wast graffed in among them, and a fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree didst become— 18do not boast against the branches; and if thou dost boast, thou dost not bear the root, but the root thee!"
Romans,11,19,"Thou wilt say, then, ‘The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in;’ right! 20by unbelief they were broken off, and thou hast stood by faith; be not high-minded, but be fearing; 21for if God"

Romans,11,23,"And those also, if they may not remain in unbelief, shall be graffed in, for God is able again to graff them in; 24for if thou, out of the olive tree, wild by nature, wast cut out, and, contrary to nature, wast graffed into a good olive tree, how much rather shall they, who are according to nature, be graffed into their own olive tree? All Israel Will Be Saved"
Romans,11,25,"For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this secret—that ye may not be wise in your own conceits—that hardness in part to Israel hath happened till the fulness of the nations may come in; 26and so all Israel shall be saved, according as it hath been written, ‘There shall come forth out of Sion he who is delivering, and he shall turn away impiety from Jacob, 27and this to them is the covenant from Me, when I may take away their sins.’"
Romans,11,28,"As regards, indeed, the good tidings, they are enemies on your account; and as regards the choice— beloved on account of the fathers; 29for unrepented of are the gifts and the calling of God; 30for as ye also once did not believe in God, and now did find kindness by the unbelief of these: 31so also these now did not believe, that in your kindness they also may find kindness; 32for God did shut up together the whole to unbelief, that to the whole He might do kindness.

Romans,11,33,"O depth of riches, and wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable His judgments, and untraceable His ways! 34for who did know the mind of the Lord? or who did become His counsellor? 35or who did first give to Him, and it shall be given back to him again? 36because of Him, and through Him, and to Him are the all things; to Him is the glory—to the ages. Amen."
Romans,12,1,"I call upon you, therefore, brethren, through the compassions of God, to present your bodies a sacrifice—living, sanctified, acceptable to God—your intelligent service; 2and be not conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, for your proving what is the will of God—the good, and acceptable, and perfect."
Romans,12,3,"For I say, through the grace that was given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think above what it behoveth to think; but to think so as to think wisely, as to each God did deal a measure of faith, 4for as in one body we have many members, and all the members have not the same office, 5so we,"
Romans,12,6,"And having gifts, different according to the grace that was given to us; whether prophecy—‘According to the proportion of faith!’ 7or ministration—‘In the ministration!’ or he who is teaching—‘In the teaching!’ 8or he who is exhorting—‘In the exhortation!’ he who is sharing—‘In simplicity!’ he who is leading—‘In diligence?’ he who is doing kindness—‘In cheerfulness.’ Love, Zeal, Hope, Hospitality (John 13:31–35; 1 John 3:11–24)"
Romans,12,9,"The love unfeigned: abhorring the evil; cleaving to the good; 10in the love of brethren, to one another kindly affectioned: in the honour going before one another; 11in the diligence not slothful; in the spirit fervent; the Lord serving; 12in the hope rejoicing; in the tribulation enduring; in the prayer persevering; 13to the necessities of the saints communicating; the hospitality pursuing. Forgiveness (Matthew 18:21–35)"
Romans,12,14,"Bless those persecuting you; bless, and curse not; 15to rejoice with the rejoicing, and to weep with the weeping, 16of the same mind one toward another, not minding the high things, but with the lowly going along; become not wise in your own conceit; 17giving back to no one evil for evil; providing right"
Romans,12,18,If possible—so far as in you—with all men being in peace; 19not avenging
Romans,12,20,"I will recompense again, saith the Lord;’ if, then, thine enemy doth hunger, feed him; if he doth thirst, give"
Romans,12,21,"Be not overcome by the evil, but overcome, in the good, the evil."
Romans,13,1,"Let every soul to the higher authorities be subject, for there is no authority except from God, and the authorities existing are appointed by God, 2so that he who is setting himself against the authority,"
Romans,13,3,"For those ruling are not a terror to the good works, but to the evil; and dost thou wish not to be afraid of the authority? that which is good be doing, and thou shalt have praise from it, 4for of God it is a ministrant to thee for good; and if that which is evil thou mayest do, be fearing, for not in vain doth it bear the sword; for of God it is a ministrant, an avenger for wrath to him who is doing that which is"
Romans,13,5,"Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because of the wrath, but also because of the conscience, 6for because of this also pay ye tribute; for servants of God they are, on this very thing attending continually; 7render, therefore, to all their dues; to whom tribute, the tribute; to whom custom, the custom; to whom fear, the fear; to whom honour, the honour. Love Fulfills the Law (Leviticus 19:9–18)"
Romans,13,8,"To no one owe anything, except to love one another; for he who is loving the other—law he hath fulfilled, 9for, ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false testimony, Thou shalt not covet;’ and if there is any other command, in this word it is summed up, in this: ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;’ 10the love to the neighbour doth work no ill; the love, therefore, is the fulness of law. The Day Is Near"
Romans,13,11,"And this, knowing the time, that for us, the hour already is to be aroused out of sleep, for now nearer is our salvation than when we did believe; 12the night did advance, and the day came nigh; let us lay aside, therefore, the works of the darkness, and let us put on the armour of the light; 13as in day-time, let us walk becomingly; not in revellings and drunkennesses, not in chamberings and lasciviousnesses, not in strife and emulation; 14but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and for the flesh take no forethought—for desires."
Romans,14,1,"And him who is weak in the faith receive ye—not to determinations of reasonings; 2one doth believe that he may eat all things—and he who is weak doth eat herbs; 3let not him who is eating despise him who is not eating: and let not him who is not eating judge him who is eating, for God did receive him."
Romans,14,4,"Thou—who art thou that art judging another’s domestic? to his own master he doth stand or fall; and he shall be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand."
Romans,14,5,"One doth judge one day above another, and another doth judge every day alike; let each in his own"
Romans,14,6,"He who is regarding the day, to the Lord he doth regard it, and he who is not regarding the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He who is eating, to the Lord he doth eat, for he doth give thanks to God; and he who is not eating, to the Lord he doth not eat, and doth give thanks"
Romans,14,7,"For none of us to himself doth live, and none to himself doth die; 8for both, if we may live, to the Lord we live; if also we may die, to the Lord we die; both then if we may live, also if we may die, we are the Lord’s; 9for because of this Christ both died and rose again, and lived again, that both of dead and of living he may be Lord."
Romans,14,10,"And thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or again, thou, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand at the tribunal of the Christ; 11for it hath been written, ‘I live! saith the Lord—to Me bow shall every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God;’ 12so, then, each of us concerning himself shall give reckoning to God; The Law of Love (Ezekiel 14:1–11; 1 Corinthians 8:1–13) 13no longer, therefore, may we judge one another, but this judge ye rather, not to put a stumbling-"
Romans,14,14,"I have known, and am persuaded, in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself, except to him who is reckoning anything to be unclean—to that one it is unclean; 15and if through victuals thy brother is grieved, no more dost thou walk according to love; do"
Romans,14,16,"Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of, 17for the reign of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit; 18for he who in these things is serving the Christ, is acceptable to God and approved of men."
Romans,14,19,"So, then, the things of peace may we pursue, and the things of building up one another; 20for the sake of victuals cast not down the work of God; all things, indeed, are pure, but evil is to the man who"
Romans,14,21,"Right it is not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything in which"
Romans,14,22,"Thou hast faith! to thyself have it before God; happy is he who is not judging himself in what he doth approve, 23and he who is making a difference, if he may eat, hath been condemned, because it is not of faith; and all that is not of faith is sin."
Romans,15,1,"And we ought—we who are strong—to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves; 2for let each one of us please the neighbour for good, unto edification, 3for even the Christ did not please himself, but, according as it hath been written, ‘The reproaches of those reproaching Thee fell upon me;’ 4for, as many things as were written before, for our instruction were written before, that"
Romans,15,5,"And may the God of the endurance, and of the exhortation, give to you to have the same mind toward one another, according to Christ Jesus; 6that with one accord—with one mouth—ye may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; Christ the Servant of Jews and Gentiles 7wherefore receive ye one another, according as also the Christ did receive us, to the glory of God."
Romans,15,8,"And I say Jesus Christ to have become a ministrant of circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises to the fathers, 9and the nations for kindness to glorify God, according as it hath been written, ‘Because of this I will confess to Thee among nations, and to Thy name I will sing praise,’ 10and again it saith, ‘Rejoice ye nations, with His people;’ 11and again, ‘Praise the Lord, all ye nations; and laud Him, all ye peoples;’ 12and again, Isaiah saith, ‘There shall be the root of Jesse, and he who is rising to rule nations—upon him shall nations hope;’ 13and the God of the hope shall fill you with all joy and peace in the believing, for your abounding in the hope in power of the Holy Spirit. Paul the Minister to the Gentiles"
Romans,15,14,"And I am persuaded, my brethren—I myself also—concerning you, that ye yourselves also are full of goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, able also one another to admonish; 15and the more boldly I did write to you, brethren, in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me by God, 16for my being a servant of Jesus Christ to the nations, acting as priest in the good news of God, that the offering up of the nations may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
Romans,15,17,"I have, then, a boasting in Christ Jesus, in the things pertaining to God, 18for I will not dare to speak anything of the things that Christ did not work through me, to obedience of nations, by word and deed, 19in power of signs and wonders, in power of the Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circle as far as Illyricum, have fully preached the good news of the Christ; 20and so counting it honour to proclaim good news, not where Christ was named—that upon another’s foundation I might not build— 21but according as it hath been written, ‘To whom it was not told concerning him, they shall see; and they who have not heard, shall understand.’"
Romans,15,22,"Wherefore, also, I was hindered many times from coming unto you, Paul’s Travel Plans (1 Corinthians 16:5–9) 23and now, no longer having place in these parts, and having a longing to come unto you for many years, 24when I may go on to Spain I will come unto you, for I hope in going through, to see you, and"
Romans,15,25,"And, now, I go on to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints; 26for it pleased Macedonia and Achaia well to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who are in Jerusalem; 27for it pleased well, and their debtors they are, for if in their spiritual things the nations did participate, they ought also, in the fleshly things, to minister to"
Romans,15,28,"This, then, having finished, and having sealed to them this fruit, I will return through you, to Spain; 29and I have known that coming unto you—in the fulness of the blessing of the good news of Christ I shall come."
Romans,15,30,"And I call upon you, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in the prayers for me unto God, 31that I may be delivered from those not believing in Judea, and that my ministration, that is for Jerusalem, may become acceptable to the saints; 32that in joy I may come unto you, through the will of God, and may be refreshed with you, 33and the God of the peace be with you all. Amen."
Romans,16,1,"And I commend you to Phebe our sister—being a ministrant of the assembly that is in Cenchrea— 2that ye may receive her in the Lord, as doth become saints, and may assist her in whatever matter she may have need of you—for she also became a leader of many, and of myself."
Romans,16,3,"Salute Priscilla and Aquilas, my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus— 4who for my life their own neck did lay down, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the nations— 5and the assembly"
Romans,16,6,"Salute Mary, who did labour much for us; 7salute Andronicus and Junias, my kindred, and my fellow-captives, who are"
Romans,16,8,"Salute Amplias, my beloved in the Lord; 9salute Arbanus, our fellow-workman in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved; 10salute Apelles, the approved in Christ; salute those of the household of Aristobulus; 11salute Herodion, my kinsman; salute those of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord; 12salute Tryphaena, and Tryphosa,"
Romans,16,13,"Salute Rufus, the choice one in the Lord, and his mother and mine, 14salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren with them; 15salute Philologus, and Julias, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them; 16salute one another in a holy kiss; the assemblies of Christ do salute you. Avoid Divisions (Titus 3:9–11)"
Romans,16,17,"And I call upon you, brethren, to mark those who the divisions and the stumbling-blocks, contrary to the teaching that ye did learn, are causing, and turn ye away from them; 18for such our Lord Jesus Christ do not serve, but their own belly; and through the good word and fair speech they deceive the hearts of the harmless, 19for your obedience did reach to all; I rejoice, therefore, as regards you, and I wish you to be wise, indeed, as to the good, and harmless as to the evil; 20and the God of the peace shall bruise the Adversary under your feet quickly; the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen! Greetings from Paul’s Fellow Workers (Colossians 4:7–14)"
Romans,16,21,"Salute you do Timotheus, my fellow-workman, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kindred;"
Romans,16,22,"I Tertius salute you (who wrote the letter) in the Lord; 23salute you doth Gaius, my host, and of the whole assembly; salute you doth Erastus, the steward of the city, and Quartus the brother, 24the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. Doxology (Jude 1:24–25)"
Romans,16,25,"And to Him who is able to establish you, according to my good news, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the secret, in the times of the ages having been kept silent, 26and now having been made manifest, also, through prophetic writings, according to a command of the age- during God, having been made known to all the nations for obedience of faith— 27to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to him be glory to the ages. Amen."
1 Corinthians,1,1,"Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother, 2to the assembly of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place—both theirs and ours:"
1 Corinthians,1,3,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! Thanksgiving (Philippians 1:3–11; Colossians 1:3–14)
1 Corinthians,1,4,"I give thanks to my God always concerning you for the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus, 5that in every thing ye were enriched in him, in all discourse and all knowledge, 6according as the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in you, 7so that ye are not behind in any gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, 8who also shall confirm you unto the end—unblamable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ; 9faithful is God, through whom ye were called to the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Unity in the Church (Psalm 133:1–3; Ephesians 4:1–16)"
1 Corinthians,1,10,"And I call upon you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that the same thing ye may all say, and there may not be divisions among you, and ye may be perfected in the same mind, and in the same judgment, 11for it was signified to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloe, that contentions are among you; 12and I say this, that each one of you saith, ‘I, indeed, am of Paul’—"
1 Corinthians,1,13,Hath the Christ been divided? was Paul
1 Corinthians,1,14,"I give thanks to God that no one of you did I baptize, except Crispus and Gaius— 15that no one may say that to my own name I did baptize; 16and I did baptize also Stephanas’ household—further, I have not known if I did baptize any other."
1 Corinthians,1,17,"For Christ did not send me to baptize, but—to proclaim good news; not in wisdom of discourse, that the cross of the Christ may not be made of none effect; The Message of the Cross 18for the word of the cross to those indeed perishing is foolishness, and to us—those being saved—it is the power of God, 19for it hath been written, ‘I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will bring to nought;’ 20where is the wise? where the scribe? where a disputer of this age? did not God make foolish the wisdom of this world? 21for, seeing in the wisdom of God the world through the wisdom knew not God,"
1 Corinthians,1,22,"Since also Jews ask a sign, and Greeks seek wisdom, 23also we—we preach Christ crucified, to Jews, indeed, a stumbling-block, and to Greeks foolishness, 24and to those called—both Jews and Greeks—Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God, 25because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men; Wisdom from God 26for see your calling, brethren, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble; 27but the foolish things of the world did God choose, that the wise He may put to shame; and the weak things of the world did God choose that He may put to shame the strong; 28and the base things of the world, and the things despised did God choose, and the things that are not, that the things that are He may make useless— 29that no flesh may glory before Him; 30and of Him ye—ye are in Christ Jesus, who became to us from God wisdom, righteousness also, and sanctification, and redemption, 31that, according as it hath been written, ‘He who is glorying—in the Lord let him glory.’"
1 Corinthians,2,1,"And I, having come unto you, brethren, came—not in superiority of discourse or wisdom—declaring to you the testimony of God, 2for I decided not to know any thing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified; 3and I, in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling, was with you; 4and my word and my preaching was not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power— 5that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Spiritual Wisdom (Ephesians 1:15–23)"
1 Corinthians,2,6,"And wisdom we speak among the perfect, and wisdom not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age— of those becoming useless, 7but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a secret, that God foreordained before the ages to our glory, 8which no one of the rulers of this age did know, for if they had known, the Lord of the glory they would not have crucified; 9but, according as it hath been written, ‘What eye did not see, and ear did not hear, and upon the heart of man came not up, what God did prepare for those loving Him—‘ 10but to us did God reveal them through His Spirit, for the Spirit all things doth search, even the depths of God, 11for who of men hath known the things of the man, except the spirit of the man that is in"
1 Corinthians,2,12,"And we the spirit of the world did not receive, but the Spirit that is of God, that we may know the things conferred by God on us, 13which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, with spiritual things spiritual things comparing, 14and the natural man doth not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for to him they are foolishness, and he is not able to know them, because spiritually they are discerned; 15and he who is spiritual, doth discern indeed all things, and he himself is by no one discerned; 16for who did know the mind of the Lord that he shall instruct Him? and we—we have the mind of Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,1,"And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly—as to babes in Christ; 2with milk I fed you, and not with meat, for ye were not yet able, but not even yet are ye now able, 3for yet ye are fleshly, for where there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not fleshly, and in the manner of men do walk? 4for when one may say, ‘I, indeed, am of Paul;’ and another, ‘I—of Apollos;’ are ye not fleshly?"
1 Corinthians,3,5,"Who, then, is Paul, and who Apollos, but ministrants through whom ye did believe, and to each as"
1 Corinthians,3,6,"I planted, Apollos watered, but God was giving growth; 7so that neither is he who is planting anything, nor he who is watering, but He who is giving growth—God; 8and he who is planting and he who is watering are one, and each his own reward shall receive, according to his own labour, 9for of God we are fellow-workmen; God’s tillage, God’s building ye are. Christ Our Foundation (Isaiah 28:14–22; Ephesians 2:19–22; 1 Peter 2:1–8)"
1 Corinthians,3,10,"According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a wise master-builder, a foundation I have laid, and another doth build on it, 11for other foundation no one is able to lay except that which is laid, which is Jesus the Christ; 12and if any one doth build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw— 13of each the work shall become manifest, for the day shall declare it, because in fire it is revealed, and the work of each, what kind it is, the fire shall prove; 14if of any one the work doth remain that he built on it, a wage he shall receive; 15if of any the work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; and himself shall be saved, but so as through fire. God’s Temple and God’s Wisdom (Romans 12:1–8; 1 Corinthians 6:18–20) 16have ye not known that ye are a sanctuary of God, and the Spirit of God doth dwell in you? 17if any one the sanctuary of God doth waste, him shall God waste; for the sanctuary of God is holy, the which ye are."
1 Corinthians,3,18,"Let no one deceive himself; if any one doth seem to be wise among you in this age—let him become a fool, that he may become wise, 19for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it hath been written, ‘Who is taking the wise in their craftiness;’ 20and again, ‘The Lord doth know the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.’"
1 Corinthians,3,21,"So then, let no one glory in men, for all things are yours, 22whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things about to be—all are yours, 23and ye are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s."
1 Corinthians,4,1,"Let a man so reckon us as officers of Christ, and stewards of the secrets of God, 2and as to the rest, it is required in the stewards that one may be found faithful, 3and to me it is for a very little thing that by you I may be judged, or by man’s day, but not even myself do I judge, 4for of nothing to myself have I been conscious, but not in this have I been declared right—and he who is discerning me is the Lord: 5so, then, nothing before the time judge ye, till the Lord may come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of the darkness, and will manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then the praise shall come to each from God."
1 Corinthians,4,6,"And these things, brethren, I did transfer to myself and to Apollos because of you, that in us ye may learn not to think above that which hath been written, that ye may not be puffed up one for one against the other, 7for who doth make thee to differ? and what hast thou, that thou didst not receive? and if thou didst also receive, why dost thou glory as not having received?"
1 Corinthians,4,8,"Already ye are having been filled, already ye were rich, apart from us ye did reign, and I would also ye did reign, that we also with you may reign together, 9for I think that God did set forth us the apostles last—as appointed to death, because a spectacle we became to the world, and messengers, and men; 10we are fools because of Christ, and ye wise in Christ; we are ailing, and ye strong; ye glorious, and we dishonoured; 11unto the present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and wander about, 12and labour, working with our own hands; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer; 13being spoken evil of, we entreat; as filth of the world we did become— of all things an offscouring—till now. Paul’s Fatherly Warning"
1 Corinthians,4,14,"Not as putting you to shame do I write these things, but as my beloved children I do admonish, 15for if a myriad of child-conductors ye may have in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus, through"
1 Corinthians,4,16,"I call upon you, therefore, become ye followers of me; 17because of this I sent to you Timotheus, who is my child, beloved and faithful in the Lord, who shall remind you"
1 Corinthians,4,18,"And as if I were not coming unto you certain were puffed up; 19but I will come quickly unto you, if the Lord may will, and I will know not the word of those puffed up, but the power; 20for not in word is the reign of God, but in power? 21what do ye wish? with a rod shall I come unto you, or in love, with a spirit also of meekness?"
1 Corinthians,5,1,"Whoredom is actually heard of among you, and such whoredom as is not even named among the nations—as that one hath the wife of the father!— 2and ye are having been puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he may be removed out of the midst of you who did this work, 3for I indeed, as being absent as to the body, and present as to the spirit, have already judged, as being present, him who so wrought this thing: 4in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—ye being gathered together, also my spirit—with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 5to deliver up such a one to the Adversary for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
1 Corinthians,5,6,"Not good is your glorying; have ye not known that a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven? 7cleanse out, therefore, the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened, for also our passover for us was sacrificed—Christ, 8so that we may keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness, but with unleavened food of sincerity and truth. Expel the Immoral Brother"
1 Corinthians,5,9,"I did write to you in the epistle, not to keep company with whoremongers— 10and not certainly with the whoremongers of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, seeing ye ought then to go forth out of the world— 11and now, I did write to you not to keep company with him, if any one, being named a brother, may be a whoremonger, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner—with such a one not even to eat together; 12for what have I also those without to judge? those within do ye not judge? 13and those without God doth judge; and put ye away the evil from among yourselves."
1 Corinthians,6,1,"Dare any one of you, having a matter with the other, go to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? 2have ye not known that the saints shall judge the world? and if by you the world is judged, are ye unworthy of the smaller judgments? 3have ye not known that we shall judge messengers? why not then the things of life? 4of the things of life, indeed, then, if ye may have judgment, those despised in the assembly—these cause ye to sit; 5unto your shame I speak: so there is not among you one wise man, not even one, who shall be able to discern in the midst of his brethren! 6but brother with brother doth go to be judged, and this before unbelievers!"
1 Corinthians,6,7,"Already, indeed, then, there is altogether a fault among you, that ye have judgments with one another; wherefore do ye not rather suffer injustice? wherefore be ye not rather defrauded? 8but ye— ye do injustice, and ye defraud, and these—brethren! Members of Christ 9have ye not known that the unrighteous the reign of God shall not inherit? be not led astray; neither whoremongers, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites, 10nor thieves, nor"

1 Corinthians,6,19,"Have ye not known that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own, 20for ye were bought with a price; glorify, then, God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s."
1 Corinthians,7,1,"And concerning the things of which ye wrote to me: good it is for a man not to touch a woman, 2and because of the whoredom let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her proper husband; 3to the wife let the husband the due benevolence render, and in like manner also the wife to the husband; 4the wife over her own body hath not authority, but the husband; and, in like manner"
1 Corinthians,7,5,"Defraud not one another, except by consent for a time, that ye may be free for fasting and prayer, and again may come together, that the Adversary may not tempt you because of your incontinence; 6and this I say by way of concurrence—not of command, 7for I wish all men to be even as I myself am; but each his own gift hath of God, one indeed thus, and one thus."
1 Corinthians,7,8,"And I say to the unmarried and to the widows: it is good for them if they may remain even as I am; 9and if they have not continence—let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn; 10and to the married I announce—not I, but the Lord—let not a wife separate from a husband: 11but and if she may separate, let her remain unmarried, or to the husband let her be reconciled, and let not a husband send away a wife."
1 Corinthians,7,12,"And to the rest I speak—not the Lord—if any brother hath a wife unbelieving, and she is pleased to dwell with him, let him not send her away; 13and a woman who hath a husband unbelieving, and he is pleased to dwell with her, let her not send him away; 14for the unbelieving husband hath been sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife hath been sanctified in the husband; otherwise your"
1 Corinthians,7,15,"And, if the unbelieving doth separate himself—let him separate himself: the brother or the sister is not under servitude in such cases, and in peace hath God called us; 16for what, hast thou known, O wife, whether the husband thou shalt save? or what, hast thou known, O husband, whether the wife thou shalt save? Live Your Calling 17if not, as God did distribute to each, as the Lord hath called each—so let him walk; and thus in all the assemblies do I direct: 18being circumcised—was any one called? let him not become uncircumcised; in uncircumcision was any one called? let him not be circumcised; 19the circumcision is"
1 Corinthians,7,20,"Each in the calling in which he was called—in this let him remain; 21a servant—wast thou called? be not anxious; but if also thou art able to become free—use it rather; 22for he who is in the Lord—having been called a servant—is the Lord’s freedman: in like manner also he the freeman, having been called, is servant of Christ: 23with a price ye were bought, become not servants of men; 24each, in that in which he was called, brethren, in this let him remain with God.

1 Corinthians,7,37,"And he who hath stood stedfast in the heart—not having necessity—and hath authority over his own will, and this he hath determined in his heart—to keep his own virgin—doth well; 38so that both he who is giving in marriage doth well, and he who is not giving in marriage doth better."
1 Corinthians,7,39,"A wife hath been bound by law as long time as her husband may live, and if her husband may sleep, she is free to be married to whom she will—only in the Lord; 40and she is happier if she may so remain—according to my judgment; and I think I also have the Spirit of God."
1 Corinthians,8,1,"And concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that we all have knowledge: knowledge puffeth up, but love buildeth up; 2and if any one doth think to know anything, he hath not yet known anything according as it behoveth him to know; 3and if any one doth love God, this one hath been known by Him."
1 Corinthians,8,4,"Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one; 5for even if there are those called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon earth—as there are gods many and lords many— 6yet to us is one God, the Father, of whom are the all things, and we to Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are the all things, and we through Him; 7but not in all men is the knowledge, and certain with conscience of the idol, till now, as a thing"
1 Corinthians,8,8,"But victuals do not commend us to God, for neither if we may eat are we in advance; nor if we may not eat, are we behind; 9but see, lest this privilege of yours may become a stumbling-block to the infirm, 10for if any one may see thee that hast knowledge in an idol’s temple reclining at meat—shall not his conscience—he being infirm—be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to idols, 11and the brother who is infirm shall perish by thy knowledge, because of whom Christ died? 12and thus sinning in regard to the brethren, and smiting their weak conscience—in regard to Christ ye sin; 13wherefore, if victuals cause my brother to stumble, I may eat no flesh—to the age—that my brother I may not cause to stumble."
1 Corinthians,9,1,Am not I an apostle? am not I free? Jesus Christ our Lord have I not seen? my work are not ye in the Lord? 2if to others I am not an apostle—yet doubtless to you I am; for the seal of my apostleship are ye in the Lord.
1 Corinthians,9,3,"My defence to those who examine me in this; 4have we not authority to eat and to drink? 5have we not authority a sister—a wife—to lead about, as also the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 6or only I and Barnabas, have we not authority—not to work? 7who doth serve as a soldier at his own charges at any time? who doth plant a vineyard, and of its fruit doth not eat? or who doth feed a flock, and of the milk of the flock doth not eat?"
1 Corinthians,9,8,"According to man do I speak these things? or doth not also the law say these things? 9for in the law of Moses it hath been written, ‘thou shalt not muzzle an ox treading out corn;’ for the oxen doth God care? 10or because of us by all means doth He say it? yes, because of us it was written, because in"

1 Corinthians,9,13,"Have ye not known that those working about the things of the temple—of the temple do eat, and those waiting at the altar—with the altar are partakers? 14so also did the Lord direct to those proclaiming the good news: of the good news to live."
1 Corinthians,9,15,"And I have used none of these things; neither did I write these things that it may be so done in my case, for it is good for me rather to die, than that any one may make my glorying void; 16for if I may proclaim good news, it is no glorying for me, for necessity is laid upon me, and woe is to me if I may not proclaim good news; 17for if willing I do this, I have a reward; and if unwillingly—with a stewardship"

1 Corinthians,10,1,"And I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, 2and all to Moses were baptized in the cloud, and in the sea; 3and all the same spiritual food did eat, 4and all the same spiritual drink did drink, for they were drinking of a spiritual rock following them, and the rock was the Christ; 5but in the most of them God was not well pleased, for they were strewn in the wilderness, 6and those things became types of us, for our not passionately desiring evil things, as also these did"
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Neither become ye idolaters, as certain of them, as it hath been written, ‘The people sat down to eat and to drink, and stood up to play;’ 8neither may we commit whoredom, as certain of them did commit whoredom, and there fell in one day twenty-three thousand; 9neither may we tempt the Christ, as also certain of them did tempt, and by the serpents did perish; 10neither murmur ye, as also some"

1 Corinthians,10,18,"See Israel according to the flesh! are not those eating the sacrifices in the fellowship of the altar? 19what then do I say? that an idol is anything? or that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything?— 20no, but that the things that the nations sacrifice—they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not wish you to come into the fellowship of the demons."
1 Corinthians,10,21,"Ye are not able the cup of the Lord to drink, and the cup of demons; ye are not able of the table of the Lord to partake, and of the table of demons; 22do we arouse the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than He? All to God’s Glory (1 Peter 4:1–11)"

1 Corinthians,10,25,"Whatever in the meat-market is sold eat ye, not inquiring, because of the conscience, 26for the Lord’s is the earth, and its fulness; 27and if any one of the unbelieving do call you, and ye wish to go, all that is set before you eat, nothing inquiring, because of the conscience; 28and if any one may say to you, ‘This is a thing sacrificed to an idol,’—do not eat, because of that one who shewed it, and of the conscience, for the Lord’s is the earth and its fulness: 29and conscience, I say, not of thyself, but of the other, for why is it that my liberty is judged by another’s conscience? 30and if I thankfully do partake, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks?"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"Whether, then, ye eat, or drink, or do anything, do all to the glory of God; 32become offenceless, both to Jews and Greeks, and to the assembly of God; 33as I also in all things do please all, not seeking my own profit, but that of many—that they may be saved."

1 Corinthians,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having the head covered, doth dishonour his head, 5and every woman praying or prophesying with the head uncovered, doth dishonour her own head, for it is one and the same thing with her being shaven, 6for if a woman is not covered—then let her be shorn, and if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven—let her be covered; 7for a man, indeed, ought not to cover the head, being the image and glory of God, and a woman is the glory of a man, 8for a man is not of a woman, but a woman is of a man, 9for a man also was not created because of the woman, but a woman because of the man; 10because of this the woman ought to have a token of authority upon the head, because of the messengers; 11but neither is a man apart from a woman, nor a woman apart from a man, in the Lord, 12for as the woman is of the man, so also the man is through the woman, and the all things are of"
1 Corinthians,11,13,"In your own selves judge ye; is it seemly for a woman uncovered to pray to God? 14doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man indeed have long hair, a dishonour it is to him? 15and a woman, if she have long hair, a glory it is to her, because the hair instead of a covering hath been given to her; 16and if any one doth think to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the assemblies of God. Sharing in the Lord’s Supper (Matthew 26:20–30; Mark 14:17–26; Luke 22:14–23)"
1 Corinthians,11,17,"And this declaring, I give no praise, because not for the better, but for the worse ye come together; 18for first, indeed, ye coming together in an assembly, I hear of divisions being among you, and partly I believe it, 19for it behoveth sects also to be among you, that those approved may become manifest among you; 20ye, then, coming together at the same place—it is not to eat the Lord’s supper; 21for each his own supper doth take before in the eating, and one is hungry, and another is drunk; 22why, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or the assembly of God do ye despise, and shame those not having? what may I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I do not praise!"
1 Corinthians,11,23,"For I—I received from the Lord that which also I did deliver to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread, 24and having given thanks, he brake, and said, ‘Take ye, eat"
1 Corinthians,11,25,"In like manner also the cup after the supping, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood; this do ye, as often as ye may drink it—to the remembrance of me;’ 26for as often as ye may eat this bread, and this cup may drink, the death of the Lord ye do shew forth—till he may come; 27so that whoever may eat this bread or may drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, guilty he shall be of the body and blood of the Lord: 28and let a man be proving himself, and so of the bread let him eat, and of the cup let him drink; 29for he who is eating and drinking unworthily, judgment to himself"
1 Corinthians,11,30,"Because of this, among you many are weak and sickly, and sleep do many; 31for if ourselves we were discerning, we would not be being judged, 32and being judged by the Lord, we are chastened, that with the world we may not be condemned; 33so then, my brethren, coming together to eat, for one another wait ye; 34and if any one is hungry, at home let him eat, that to judgment ye may not come together; and the rest, whenever I may come, I shall arrange."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"And concerning the spiritual things, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant; 2ye have known that ye were nations, unto the dumb idols—as ye were led—being carried away; 3wherefore, I give you to understand that no one, in the Spirit of God speaking, saith Jesus is anathema, and no one is able to say Jesus is Lord, except in the Holy Spirit."

1 Corinthians,12,7,"And to each hath been given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit; 8for to one through the Spirit hath been given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; 9and to another faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healings in the same Spirit; 10and to another in-workings of mighty deeds; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; and to another divers kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues: 11and all these doth work the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each severally as he intendeth. The Body of Christ"
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For, even as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the one body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ, 13for also in one Spirit we all to one body were baptized, whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or freemen, and all into one Spirit were made to drink, 14for also the body is not one member, but many; 15if the foot may say, ‘Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body;’ it is not, because of this, not of the body; 16and if the ear may say, ‘Because I"
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where the hearing? if the whole hearing, where the smelling? 18and now, God did set the members each one of them in the body, according as He willed, 19and if all were one member, where the body? 20and now, indeed, are many members, and one body; 21and an eye is not able to say to"
1 Corinthians,12,22,"But much more the members of the body which seem to be more infirm are necessary, 23and those that we think to be less honourable of the body, around these we put more abundant honour, and our unseemly things have seemliness more abundant, 24and our seemly things have no need; but God did temper the body together, to the lacking part having given more abundant honour, 25that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same anxiety for one another, 26and whether one member doth suffer, suffer with it do all the members, or one member is glorified, rejoice with it do all the members; The Greater Gifts 27and ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And some, indeed, did God set in the assembly, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, afterwards powers, afterwards gifts of healings, helpings, governings, divers kinds of tongues; 29are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all powers? 30have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? 31and desire earnestly the better gifts; and yet a far excelling way do I shew to you:"
1 Corinthians,13,1,"If with the tongues of men and of messengers I speak, and have not love, I have become brass sounding, or a cymbal tinkling; 2and if I have prophecy, and know all the secrets, and all the knowledge, and if I have all the faith, so as to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing; 3and if I give away to feed others all my goods, and if I give up my body that I may be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"The love is long-suffering, it is kind, the love doth not envy, the love doth not vaunt itself, is not puffed up, 5doth not act unseemly, doth not seek its own things, is not provoked, doth not impute evil, 6rejoiceth not over the unrighteousness, and rejoiceth with the truth; 7all things it beareth, all it believeth, all it hopeth, all it endureth."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"The love doth never fail; and whether there be prophecies, they shall become useless; whether tongues, they shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall become useless; 9for in part we know, and in part we prophecy; 10and when that which is perfect may come, then that which is in part shall become"
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a babe, as a babe I was speaking, as a babe I was thinking, as a babe I was reasoning, and when I have become a man, I have made useless the things of the babe; 12for we see now through a mirror obscurely, and then face to face; now I know in part, and then I shall fully know, as also I was known; 13and now there doth remain faith, hope, love—these three; and the greatest of these is love."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Pursue the love, and seek earnestly the spiritual things, and rather that ye may prophecy, 2for he who is speaking in an unknown tongue—to men he doth not speak, but to God, for no one doth hearken, and in spirit he doth speak secrets; 3and he who is prophesying to men doth speak edification, and exhortation, and comfort; 4he who is speaking in an unknown tongue, himself doth edify, and he who is prophesying, an assembly doth edify; 5and I wish you all to speak with tongues, and more that ye may prophecy, for greater is he who is prophesying than he who is speaking with tongues, except one may interpret, that the assembly may receive edification."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"And now, brethren, if I may come unto you speaking tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophesying, or in teaching? 7yet the things without life giving sound—whether pipe or harp—if a difference in the sounds they may not give, how shall be known that which is piped or that which is harped? 8for if also an uncertain sound a trumpet may give, who shall prepare himself for battle? 9so also ye, if through the tongue, speech easily understood ye may not give—how shall that which is spoken be known? for ye shall be speaking to air."
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is unmeaning, 11if, then, I do not know the power of the voice, I shall be to him who is speaking a foreigner, and he who is speaking, is to me a foreigner; 12so also ye, since ye are earnestly desirous of spiritual gifts, for the building up of the assembly seek that ye may abound; 13wherefore he who is speaking in an unknown tongue—let him pray that he may interpret; 14for if I"
1 Corinthians,14,15,"What then is it? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing psalms with the spirit, and I will sing psalms also with the understanding; 16since, if thou mayest bless with the spirit, he who is filling the place of the unlearned, how shall he say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, since what thou dost say he hath not known? 17for thou, indeed, dost give thanks well, but the other is not built up!"
1 Corinthians,14,18,"I give thanks to my God—more than you all with tongues speaking— 19but in an assembly I wish to speak five words through my understanding, that others also I may instruct, rather than myriads of words in an unknown tongue."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brethren, become not children in the understanding, but in the evil be ye babes, and in the understanding become ye perfect; 21in the law it hath been written, that, ‘With other tongues and with other lips I will speak to this people, and not even so will they hear Me, saith the Lord;’ 22so that the tongues are for a sign, not to the believing, but to the unbelieving; and the prophesy is not for the"
1 Corinthians,14,23,"If, therefore, the whole assembly may come together, to the same place, and all may speak with tongues, and there may come in unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad? 24and if all may prophecy, and any one may come in, an unbeliever or unlearned, he is convicted by all, he is discerned by all, 25and so the secrets of his heart become manifest, and so having fallen upon his face, he will bow before God, declaring that God really is among you. Orderly Worship"
1 Corinthians,14,26,"What then is it, brethren? whenever ye may come together, each of you hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation? let all things be for building up; 27if an unknown tongue any one do speak, by two, or at the most, by three, and in turn, and let one interpret; 28and if there may be no interpreter, let him be silent in an assembly, and to himself let him"
1 Corinthians,14,29,"And prophets—let two or three speak, and let the others discern, 30and if to another sitting anything may be revealed, let the first be silent; 31for ye are able, one by one, all to prophesy, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted, 32and the spiritual gift of prophets to prophets are subject, 33for God is not a God of tumult, but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints."
1 Corinthians,14,34,"Your women in the assemblies let them be silent, for it hath not been permitted to them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law saith; 35and if they wish to learn anything, at home their own"
1 Corinthians,14,36,"From you did the word of God come forth? or to you alone did it come? 37if any one doth think to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge the things that I write to you—that of the Lord they are commands; 38and if any one is ignorant—let him be ignorant; 39so that, brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and to speak with tongues do not forbid; 40let all things be done decently and in order."
1 Corinthians,15,1,"And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that I proclaimed to you, which also ye did receive, in which also ye have stood, 2through which also ye are being saved, in what words I proclaimed good news to you, if ye hold fast, except ye did believe in vain, 3for I delivered to you first, what also I did receive, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Writings, 4and that he was buried, and that he hath risen on the third day, according to the Writings, 5and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve, 6afterwards he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain till now, and certain also did fall asleep; 7afterwards"
1 Corinthians,15,8,"And last of all—as to the untimely birth—he appeared also to me, 9for I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I did persecute the assembly of God, 10and by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace that is towards me came not in vain, but more abundantly than they all did I labour, yet not I, but the grace of God that is with me; 11whether, then, I or they, so we preach, and so ye did believe. The Resurrection of the Dead"
1 Corinthians,15,12,"And if Christ is preached, that out of the dead he hath risen, how say certain among you, that there is no rising again of dead persons? 13and if there be no rising again of dead persons, neither hath Christ risen; 14and if Christ hath not risen, then void is our preaching, and void also your faith, 15and we also are found false witnesses of God, because we did testify of God that He raised up the Christ, whom He did not raise if then dead persons do not rise; 16for if dead persons do not rise, neither hath Christ risen, 17and if Christ hath not risen, vain is your faith, ye are yet in your sins; 18then, also, those having fallen asleep in Christ did perish; 19if in this life we have hope in Christ only, of all men we are most to be pitied. The Order of Resurrection"
1 Corinthians,15,20,"And now, Christ hath risen out of the dead—the first-fruits of those sleeping he became, 21for since through man is the death, also through man is a rising again of the dead, 22for even as in Adam all die, so also in the Christ all shall be made alive, 23and each in his proper order, a first-fruit Christ, afterwards those who are the Christ’s, in his presence, 24then—the end, when he may deliver up the reign to God, even the Father, when he may have made useless all rule, and all authority and power— 25for it behoveth him to reign till he may have put all the enemies under his feet— 26the last enemy is done away—death; 27for all things He did put under his feet, and, when one may say that all things have been subjected, it is evident that He is excepted who did subject the all things to him, 28and when the all things may be subjected to him, then the Son also himself shall be subject to Him, who did subject to him the all things, that God may be the all in all."

1 Corinthians,15,31,"Every day do I die, by the glorying of you that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord: 32if after the manner of a man with wild beasts I fought in Ephesus, what the advantage to me if the dead do not rise? let us eat and drink, for to-"

1 Corinthians,15,35,"But some one will say, ‘How do the dead rise? 36unwise! thou—what thou dost sow is not quickened except it may die; 37and that which thou dost sow, not the body that shall be dost thou sow, but bare grain, it may be of wheat, or of some one of the others, 38and God doth give to it a body according as"
1 Corinthians,15,39,"All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fishes, and another of birds; 40and there are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but one is the glory of the heavenly, and another that of the earthly; 41one glory of sun, and another glory of moon, and another glory of stars, for star from star doth differ in glory."
1 Corinthians,15,42,"So also is the rising again of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; 43it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 44it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body; 45so also it hath been written, ‘The first man Adam became a living creature,’ the last Adam is for a life-giving spirit, 46but that which is spiritual is not first, but that which was natural, afterwards that which is spiritual."
1 Corinthians,15,47,"The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord out of heaven; 48as is the earthy, such are also the earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are also the heavenly; 49and, according as we did bear the image of the earthy, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly. Where, O Death, Is Your Victory? (Hosea 13:9–14)"
1 Corinthians,15,50,"And this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood the reign of God is not able to inherit, nor doth the corruption inherit the incorruption; 51lo, I tell you a secret; we indeed shall not all sleep, and we all shall be changed; 52in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, in the last trumpet, for it shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we—we shall be changed: 53for it behoveth this corruptible to put on incorruption, and this mortal to put on immortality; 54and when this corruptible may have put on incorruption, and this mortal may have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the word that hath been written, ‘The Death was swallowed up—to victory; 55where, O Death, thy sting? where, O Hades, thy victory?’ 56and the sting of the death is the sin, and the power of the sin the law; 57and to God—thanks, to Him who is giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ; 58so that, my brethren beloved, become ye stedfast, unmovable, abounding in the work of the Lord at all times, knowing that your labour is not vain in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,16,1,"And concerning the collection that is for the saints, as I directed to the assemblies of Galatia, so also ye—do ye; 2on every first day of the week, let each one of you lay by him, treasuring up whatever he may have prospered, that when I may come then collections may not be made; 3and whenever I may come, whomsoever ye may approve, through letters, these I will send to carry your favour to Jerusalem; 4and if it be meet for me also to go, with me they shall go. Paul’s Travel Plans (Romans 15:23–33)"
1 Corinthians,16,5,"And I will come unto you, when I pass through Macedonia—for Macedonia I do pass through— 6and with you, it may be, I will abide, or even winter, that ye may send me forward whithersoever I go, 7for I do not wish to see you now in the passing, but I hope to remain a certain time with you, if the Lord may permit; 8and I will remain in Ephesus till the Pentecost, 9for a door to me hath been opened— great and effectual—and withstanders are many. Timothy and Apollos (Philippians 2:19–30)"
1 Corinthians,16,10,"And if Timotheus may come, see that he may become without fear with you, for the work of the Lord he doth work, even as I, 11no one, then, may despise him; and send ye him forward in peace, that he may come to me, for I expect him with the brethren; 12and concerning Apollos our brother, much I did entreat him that he may come unto you with the brethren, and it was not at all his will that he may come now, and he will come when he may find convenient. Concluding Exhortations"
1 Corinthians,16,13,"Watch ye, stand in the faith; be men, be strong; 14let all your things be done in love."
1 Corinthians,16,15,"And I entreat you, brethren, ye have known the household of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruit of Achaia, and to the ministration to the saints they did set themselves— 16that ye also be subject to such, and to every one who is working with us and labouring; 17and I rejoice over the presence of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because the lack of you did these fill up; 18for they did refresh my spirit and yours; acknowledge ye, therefore, those who are such.

2 Corinthians,1,2,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ! The God of All Comfort"
2 Corinthians,1,3,"Blessed is God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of the mercies, and God of all comfort, 4who is comforting us in all our tribulation, for our being able to comfort those in any tribulation through the comfort with which we are comforted ourselves by God; 5because, as the sufferings of the Christ do abound to us, so through the Christ doth abound also our comfort; 6and whether we be in tribulation, it is for your comfort and salvation, that is wrought in the enduring of the same sufferings that we also suffer; whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort and salvation; 7and our hope is stedfast for you, knowing that even as ye are partakers of the sufferings—so also of the comfort."
2 Corinthians,1,8,"For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of our tribulation that happened to us in Asia, that we were exceedingly burdened above our power, so that we despaired even of life; 9but we ourselves in ourselves the sentence of the death have had, that we may not be trusting on ourselves, but on God, who is raising the dead, 10who out of so great a death did deliver us, and doth deliver, in whom we have hoped that even yet He will deliver; 11ye working together also for us by your supplication, that the gift through many persons to us, through many may be thankfully acknowledged for us. Paul’s Change of Plans"
2 Corinthians,1,12,"For our glorying is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we did conduct ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you; 13for no other things do we write to you, but what ye either do read or also acknowledge, and I hope that also unto the end ye shall acknowledge, 14according as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that your glory we are, even as also ye are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus; 15and in this confidence I was purposing to come unto you before, that a second favour ye might have, 16and through you to pass to Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and by you to"
2 Corinthians,1,17,"This, therefore, counselling, did I then use the lightness; or the things that I counsel, according to the flesh do I counsel, that it may be with me Yes, yes, and No, no? 18and God is faithful, that our word unto you became not Yes and No, 19for the Son of God, Jesus Christ, among you through us having been preached—through me and Silvanus and Timotheus—did not become Yes and No, but in him it hath become Yes; 20for as many as are promises of God, in him are the Yes, and in him the Amen, for glory to God through us; 21and He who is confirming you with us into Christ, and did anoint us, is God, 22who also sealed us, and gave the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
2 Corinthians,1,23,"And I for a witness on God do call upon my soul, that sparing you, I came not yet to Corinth; 24not that we are lords over your faith, but we are workers together with your joy, for by the faith ye stand."
2 Corinthians,2,1,"And I decided this to myself, not again to come in sorrow unto you, 2for if I make you sorry, then who is he who is making me glad, except he who is made sorry by me? 3and I wrote to you this same thing, that having come, I may not have sorrow from them of whom it behoved me to have joy, having confidence in you all, that my joy is of you all, 4for out of much tribulation and pressure of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that ye might be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly toward you."
2 Corinthians,2,5,"And if any one hath caused sorrow, he hath not caused sorrow to me, but in part, that I may not burden you all; 6sufficient to such a one is this punishment, that is by the more part, 7so that, on the contrary, it is rather for you to forgive and to comfort, lest by over abundant sorrow such a one may be swallowed up; 8wherefore, I call upon you to confirm love to him, 9for, for this also did I write, that"
2 Corinthians,2,10,"And to whom ye forgive anything—I also; for I also, if I have forgiven anything, to whom I have forgiven it, because of you—in the person of Christ—I forgive it, 11that we may not be over-reached by the Adversary, for of his devices we are not ignorant. Triumph in Christ"
2 Corinthians,2,12,"And having come to Troas for the good news of the Christ, and a door to me having been opened in"
2 Corinthians,2,13,"I have not had rest to my spirit, on my not finding Titus my brother, but having taken leave of them, I went forth to Macedonia; 14and to God are thanks, who at all times is leading us in triumph in the Christ, and the fragrance of His knowledge He is manifesting through us in every place, 15because of Christ a sweet fragrance we are to God, in those being saved, and in those being lost; 16to the one, indeed, a fragrance of death to death, and to the other, a fragrance of life to life; and for these things who is sufficient? 17for we are not as the many, adulterating the word of God, but as of sincerity—but as of God; in the presence of God, in Christ we do speak."
2 Corinthians,3,1,"Do we begin again to recommend ourselves, except we need, as some, letters of recommendation unto you, or from you? 2our letter ye are, having been written in our hearts, known and read by all men, 3manifested that ye are a letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in the tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart, 4and such trust we have through the Christ toward God, 5not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything, as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God, 6who also made us sufficient to be ministrants of a new covenant, not of letter, but of spirit; for the letter doth kill, and the spirit doth make alive. The Glory of the New Covenant (Exodus 34:10–35) 7and if the ministration of the death, in letters, engraved in stones, came in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look stedfastly to the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face—which was being made useless, 8how shall the ministration of the Spirit not be more in glory? 9for if the ministration of the condemnation is glory, much more doth the ministration of the righteousness abound in glory; 10for also even that which hath been glorious, hath not been glorious—in this respect, because of the superior glory; 11for if that which is being made useless is through glory, much more that which is remaining is in glory."
2 Corinthians,3,12,"Having, then, such hope, we use much freedom of speech, 13and are not as Moses, who was putting a vail upon his own face, for the sons of Israel not stedfastly to look to the end of that which is being made useless, 14but their minds were hardened, for unto this day the same vail at the reading of the Old Covenant doth remain unwithdrawn—which in Christ is being made useless— 15but till to-day, when Moses is read, a vail upon their heart doth lie, 16and whenever they may turn unto the Lord, the"
2 Corinthians,3,17,"And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty; 18and we all, with unvailed face, the glory of the Lord beholding in a mirror, to the same image are being transformed, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord."
2 Corinthians,4,1,"Because of this, having this ministration, according as we did receive kindness, we do not faint, 2but did renounce for ourselves the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor deceitfully using the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth recommending ourselves unto every conscience of men, before God; 3and if also our good news is vailed, in those perishing it is vailed, 4in whom the god of this age did blind the minds of the unbelieving, that there doth not shine forth to them the enlightening of the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God; 5for not ourselves do we preach, but Christ Jesus—Lord, and ourselves your servants because of Jesus; 6because it is God who said, Out of darkness light is to shine, who did shine in our hearts, for the enlightening of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. Treasure in Jars of Clay (Romans 6:1–14)"
2 Corinthians,4,7,"And we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us; 8on every side being in tribulation, but not straitened; perplexed, but not in despair; 9persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; 10at all times the dying of the Lord Jesus bearing about in the body, that the life also of Jesus in our body may be manifested, 11for always are we who are living delivered up to death because of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our dying flesh, 12so that, the death indeed in us doth work, and the life in you."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"And having the same spirit of the faith, according to that which hath been written, ‘I believed, therefore I did speak;’ we also do believe, therefore also do we speak; 14knowing that He who did raise up the Lord Jesus, us also through Jesus shall raise up, and shall present with you, 15for the all things are because of you, that the grace having been multiplied, because of the thanksgiving of the more, may abound to the glory of God; 16wherefore, we faint not, but if also our outward man doth decay, yet the inward is renewed day by day; 17for the momentary light matter of our tribulation, more and more exceedingly an age-during weight of glory doth work out for us— 18we not looking to the things seen, but to the things not seen; for the things seen are temporary, but the things not seen are age-during."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"For we have known that if our earthly house of the tabernacle may be thrown down, a building from God we have, an house not made with hands—age-during—in the heavens, 2for also in this we groan, with our dwelling that is from heaven earnestly desiring to clothe ourselves, 3if so be that, having clothed ourselves, we shall not be found naked, 4for we also who are in the tabernacle do groan, being burdened, seeing we wish not to unclothe ourselves, but to clothe ourselves, that the mortal may be"
2 Corinthians,5,5,"And He who did work us to this self-same thing is God, who also did give to us the earnest of the Spirit; 6having courage, then, at all times, and knowing that being at home in the body, we are away from home from the Lord,— 7for through faith we walk, not through sight— 8we have courage, and are well"
2 Corinthians,5,9,"Wherefore also we are ambitious, whether at home or away from home, to be well pleasing to him, 10for all of us it behoveth to be manifested before the tribunal of the Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body, in reference to the things that he did, whether good or evil; Ambassadors for Christ 11having known, therefore, the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, and to God we are manifested, and I hope also in your consciences to have been manifested; 12for not again ourselves do we recommend to you, but we are giving occasion to you of glorifying in our behalf, that ye may have something in reference to those glorifying in face and not in heart; 13for whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God; whether we be of sound mind—it is to you, 14for the love of the Christ doth constrain us, having judged thus: that if one for all died, then the whole died, 15and for all he died, that those living, no more to themselves may live, but to him who died for them, and was raised again."
2 Corinthians,5,16,"So that we henceforth have known no one according to the flesh, and even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him no more; 17so that if any one is in Christ—he is a new"
2 Corinthians,5,18,"And the all things are of God, who reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and did give to us the ministration of the reconciliation, 19how that God was in Christ—a world reconciling to Himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses; and having put in us the word of the reconciliation, 20in behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as if God were calling through us, we beseech, in behalf of Christ, ‘Be ye reconciled to God;’ 21for him who did not know sin, in our behalf He did make sin, that we may become the righteousness of God in him."
2 Corinthians,6,1,"And working together also we call upon you that ye receive not in vain the grace of God— 2for He saith, ‘In an acceptable time I did hear thee, and in a day of salvation I did help thee, lo, now is a well-accepted time; lo, now, a day of salvation,’— 3in nothing giving any cause of offence, that the ministration may be not blamed, 4but in everything recommending ourselves as God’s ministrants; in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in distresses, 5in stripes, in imprisonments, in insurrections, in labours, in watchings, in fastings, 6in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned, 7in the word of truth, in the power of God, through the armour of the righteousness, on the right and on the left, 8through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report, as leading astray, and true; 9as unknown, and recognized; as dying, and lo, we live; as chastened, and not put to death; 10as sorrowful, and always rejoicing; as poor, and making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things."
2 Corinthians,6,11,"Our mouth hath been open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart hath been enlarged! 12ye are not straitened in us, and ye are straitened in your own bowels, 13and as a recompense of the same kind, (as to children I say it,) be ye enlarged—also ye! Do Not Be Unequally Yoked"
2 Corinthians,6,14,"Become not yoked with others—unbelievers, for what partaking is there to righteousness and lawlessness? 15and what fellowship to light with darkness? and what concord to Christ with Belial? or what part to a believer with an unbeliever? 16and what agreement to the sanctuary of God with idols? for ye are a sanctuary of the living God, according as God said—‘I will dwell in them, and will walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people, 17wherefore, come ye forth out of the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and an unclean thing do not touch, and I—I will receive you, 18and I will be to you for a Father, and ye—ye shall be to Me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.’"
2 Corinthians,7,1,"Having, then, these promises, beloved, may we cleanse ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting sanctification in the fear of God; 2receive us; no one did we wrong; no one did we waste; no one did we defraud; 3not to condemn you do I say it, for I have said before that in our hearts ye are to die with and to live with; 4great is my freedom of speech unto you, great my glory on your behalf; I have been filled with the comfort, I overabound with the joy on all our tribulation, 5for also we, having come to Macedonia, no relaxation hath our flesh had, but on every side we are in tribulation, without are fightings, within—fears; 6but He who is comforting the cast-down—God—He did comfort us in the presence of Titus; 7and not only in his presence, but also in the comfort with which he was comforted over you, declaring to us your longing desire, your lamentation, your zeal for me, so that the more I did rejoice, 8because even if I made you sorry in the letter, I do not repent—if"
2 Corinthians,7,9,"I now do rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye were made sorry to reformation, for ye were made sorry toward God, that in nothing ye might receive damage from us; 10for the sorrow toward God reformation to salvation not to be repented of doth work, and the sorrow of the world doth work death, 11for, lo, this same thing—your being made sorry toward God—how much diligence it doth work in you! but defence, but displeasure, but fear, but longing desire, but zeal, but revenge; in every thing"
2 Corinthians,7,12,"If, then, I also wrote to you—not for his cause who did wrong, nor for his cause who did suffer wrong, but for our diligence in your behalf being manifested unto you before God— 13because of this we have been comforted in your comfort, and more abundantly the more did we rejoice in the joy of Titus, that his spirit hath been refreshed from you all; 14because if anything to him in your behalf I have boasted, I was not put to shame; but as all things in truth we did speak to you, so also our boasting before Titus became truth, 15and his tender affection is more abundantly toward you, remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and"
2 Corinthians,7,16,"I rejoice, therefore, that in everything I have courage in you."
2 Corinthians,8,1,"And we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God, that hath been given in the assemblies of Macedonia, 2because in much trial of tribulation the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty, did abound to the riches of their liberality; 3because, according to their power, I testify, and above their power, they were willing of themselves, 4with much entreaty calling on us to receive the favour and the fellowship of the ministration to the saints, 5and not according as we expected, but themselves they did give first to the Lord, and to us, through the will of God, 6so that we exhorted Titus, that, according as he did begin before, so also he may finish to you also this favour, 7but even as in every thing ye do abound, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us, that also in this grace ye may abound; 8not according to command do I speak, but because of the diligence of others, and of your love proving the genuineness, 9for ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that because of you he became poor—being rich, that ye by that poverty may become rich. 10and an opinion in this do I give: for this to you is expedient, who not only to do, but also to will, did begin before—a year ago, 11and now also finish doing it, that even as there is the readiness of the will, so also the finishing, out of that which ye have, 12for if the willing mind is present, according to that which any one may have it is well-accepted, not according to that which he hath not; 13for not that for others release, and ye pressured, do I speak, 14but by equality, at the present time your abundance—for their want, that also their abundance may be for your want, that there may be equality, 15according as it hath been written, ‘He who did gather much, had nothing over; and he who did gather little, had no lack.’ Titus Commended (Titus 1:1–4)"
2 Corinthians,8,16,"And thanks to God, who is putting the same diligence for you in the heart of Titus, 17because indeed the exhortation he accepted, and being more diligent, of his own accord he went forth unto you, 18and we sent with him the brother, whose praise in the good news is through all the assemblies, 19and not only so, but who was also appointed by vote by the assemblies, our fellow-traveller, with this favour that is ministered by us, unto the glory of the same Lord, and your willing mind; 20avoiding this, lest any one may blame us in this abundance that is ministered by us, 21providing right things, not only before the Lord, but also before men; 22and we sent with them our brother, whom we proved in many things many times being diligent, and now much more diligent, by the great confidence that is toward you, 23whether—about Titus—my partner and towards you fellow-worker, whether—our brethren, apostles of assemblies—glory of Christ; 24the shewing therefore of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf, to them shew ye, even in the face of the assemblies."
2 Corinthians,9,1,"For, indeed, concerning the ministration that is for the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you, 2for I have known your readiness of mind, which in your behalf I boast of to Macedonians, that Achaia hath been prepared a year ago, and the zeal of you did stir up the more part, 3and I sent the brethren, that our boasting on your behalf may not be made vain in this respect; that, according as I said, ye may be ready, 4lest if Macedonians may come with me, and find you unprepared, we—we may be put"
2 Corinthians,9,5,"Necessary, therefore, I thought it to exhort the brethren, that they may go before to you, and may make up before your formerly announced blessing, that this be ready, as a blessing, and not as covetousness."
2 Corinthians,9,6,"And this: He who is sowing sparingly, sparingly also shall reap; and he who is sowing in blessings, in blessings also shall reap; 7each one, according as he doth purpose in heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for a cheerful giver doth God love, 8and God is able all grace to cause to abound to you, that in every thing always all sufficiency having, ye may abound to every good work, 9(according as it hath been written, ‘He dispersed abroad, he gave to the poor, his righteousness doth remain to the age,’) 10and may He who is supplying seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness, 11in every thing being enriched to all liberality, which doth work through us thanksgiving to God, 12because the ministration of this service not only is supplying the wants of the saints, but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God, 13through the proof of this ministration glorifying God for the subjection of your confession to the good news of the Christ, and for the liberality of the fellowship to them and to all, 14and by their supplication in your behalf, longing after you because of the exceeding grace of God upon you; 15thanks also to God for His unspeakable gift!"
2 Corinthians,10,1,"And I, Paul, myself, do call upon you—through the meekness and gentleness of the Christ—who in presence, indeed am humble among you, and being absent, have courage toward you, 2and I beseech you, that, being present, I may not have courage, with the confidence with which I reckon to be bold against certain reckoning us as walking according to the flesh; 3for walking in the flesh, not according to the flesh do we war, 4for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful to God for bringing down of strongholds, 5reasonings bringing down, and every high thing lifted up against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of the Christ, 6and being in readiness to avenge every disobedience, whenever your obedience may be fulfilled."
2 Corinthians,10,7,"The things in presence do ye see? if any one hath trusted in himself to be Christ’s, this let him reckon again from himself, that according as he is Christ’s, so also we are Christ’s; 8for even if also anything more abundantly I shall boast concerning our authority, that the Lord gave us for building up, and not for casting you down, I shall not be ashamed; 9that I may not seem as if I would terrify you through the letters, 10because the letters indeed—saith one—are weighty and strong, and the bodily presence"
2 Corinthians,10,11,"This one—let him reckon thus: that such as we are in word, through letters, being absent, such also, being present, we are in deed."
2 Corinthians,10,12,"For we do not make bold to rank or to compare ourselves with certain of those commending themselves, but they, among themselves measuring themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise, 13and we in regard to the unmeasured things will not boast ourselves, but after the measure of the line that the God of measure did appoint to us—to reach even unto you; 14for not as not reaching to you do we stretch ourselves overmuch, for even unto you did we come in the good news of the Christ, 15not boasting of the things not measured, in other men’s labours, and having hope—your faith increasing—in you to be enlarged, according to our line—into abundance, 16in the places beyond you to proclaim good news, not in another’s line in regard to the things made ready, to boast; 17and he who is boasting—in the Lord let him boast; 18for not he who is commending himself is approved, but he whom the Lord doth commend."
2 Corinthians,11,1,"O that ye were bearing with me a little of the folly, but ye also do bear with me: 2for I am zealous for you with zeal of God, for I did betroth you to one husband, a pure virgin, to present to Christ, 3and I fear, lest, as the serpent did beguile Eve in his subtilty, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in the Christ; 4for if, indeed, he who is coming doth preach another Jesus whom we did not preach, or another Spirit ye receive which ye did not receive, or other good news which ye did not accept—well were ye bearing it, 5for I reckon that I have been nothing behind the very chiefest apostles, 6and even if unlearned in word—yet not in knowledge, but in every thing we were made manifest in all things to you."
2 Corinthians,11,7,"The sin did I do—myself humbling that ye might be exalted, because freely the good news of God I did proclaim to you? 8other assemblies I did rob, having taken wages, for your ministration; 9and being present with you, and having been in want, I was chargeable to no one, for my lack did the brethren supply—having come from Macedonia—and in everything burdenless to you I did keep myself, and will"
2 Corinthians,11,10,"The truth of Christ is in me, because this boasting shall not be stopped in regard to me in the regions of Achaia; 11wherefore? because I do not love you? God hath known! 12and what I do, I also will do, that I may cut off the occasion of those wishing an occasion, that in that which they boast they may be found according as we also; 13for those such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ, 14and no wonder—for even the Adversary doth transform himself into a messenger of light; 15no great thing, then, if also his ministrants do transform themselves as ministrants of righteousness—whose end shall be according to their works.

2 Corinthians,11,17,"That which I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this the confidence of boasting; 18since many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast: 19for gladly do ye bear with the fools—being wise, 20for ye bear, if any one is bringing you under bondage, if any one doth devour, if any one doth take away, if any one doth exalt himself, if any one on the face doth smite you; 21in reference to dishonour I speak, how that we were weak, and in whatever any one"

Paul’s Thorn and God’s Grace"
2 Corinthians,12,5,"Of such an one I will boast, and of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities, 6for if I may wish to boast, I shall not be a fool, for truth I will say; but I forebear, lest any one in regard to me may think anything above what he doth see me, or doth hear anything of me; 7and that by the exceeding greatness of the revelations I might not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of the Adversary, that he might buffet me, that I might"
2 Corinthians,12,8,"Concerning this thing thrice the Lord did I call upon, that it might depart from me, 9and He said to me, ‘Sufficient for thee is My grace, for My power in infirmity is perfected;’ most gladly, therefore, will I rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of the Christ may rest on me: 10wherefore I am well pleased in infirmities, in damages, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses—for Christ; for whenever I am infirm, then I am powerful; Paul’s Concern for the Corinthians"

Benediction and Farewell"

Galatians,1,6,"I wonder that ye are so quickly removed from Him who did call you in the grace of Christ to another good news; 7that is not another, except there be certain who are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of the Christ; 8but even if we or a messenger out of heaven may proclaim good news to you different from what we did proclaim to you—anathema let him be! 9as we have said before, and now say again, If any one to you may proclaim good news different from what ye did receive— anathema let him be! Paul Preaches the Gospel 10for now men do I persuade, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if yet men I did please—Christ’s servant I should not be."
Galatians,1,11,"And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that were proclaimed by me, that it is not according to man, 12for neither did I from man receive it, nor was I taught it, but through a revelation of Jesus Christ, 13for ye did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism, that exceedingly I was persecuting the assembly of God, and wasting it, 14and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in mine own race, being more abundantly zealous of my fathers’ deliverances, 15and when God was well pleased—having separated me from the womb of my mother, and having called me through His grace— 16to reveal His Son in me, that I might proclaim him good news among the nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood, 17nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus, 18then, after three years I went up to Jerusalem to enquire about Peter, and remained with him fifteen"
Galatians,1,20,"And the things that I write to you, lo, before God—I lie not; 21then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia, 22and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea, that are in Christ, 23and only they were hearing, that ‘he who is persecuting us then, doth now proclaim good news—the faith that then he was wasting;’ 24and they were glorifying God in me."
Galatians,2,1,"Then, after fourteen years again I went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken with me also Titus; 2and I went up by revelation, and did submit to them the good news that I preach among the nations, and privately to those esteemed, lest in vain I might run or did run; 3but not even Titus, who is with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised— 4and that because of the false brethren brought in unawares, who did come in privily to spy out our liberty that we have in Christ Jesus, that us they might bring under bondage, 5to whom not even for an hour we gave place by subjection, that"
Galatians,2,6,"And from those who were esteemed to be something—whatever they were then, it maketh no difference to me—the face of man God accepteth not, for—to me those esteemed did add nothing, 7but, on the contrary, having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of the uncircumcision, as Peter with that of the circumcision, 8for He who did work with Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, did work also in me in regard to the nations, 9and having known the grace that was given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, who were esteemed to be pillars, a right hand of fellowship they did give to me, and to Barnabas, that we to the nations, and they to the circumcision may go, 10only, of the poor that we should be mindful, which also I was diligent—this very thing—to do. Paul Confronts Cephas"
Galatians,2,11,"And when Peter came to Antioch, to the face I stood up against him, because he was blameworthy, 12for before the coming of certain from James, with the nations he was eating, and when they came, he was withdrawing and separating himself, fearing those of the circumcision, 13and dissemble with"
Galatians,2,14,"But when I saw that they are not walking uprightly to the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, ‘If thou, being a Jew, in the manner of the nations dost live, and not in the manner of the Jews, how the nations dost thou compel to Judaize? 15we by nature Jews, and not sinners of the nations, 16having known also that a man is not declared righteous by works of law, if not through the faith of Jesus Christ, also we in Christ Jesus did believe, that we might be declared righteous by the faith of Christ, and not by works of law, wherefore declared"
Galatians,2,17,"And if, seeking to be declared righteous in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is then Christ a ministrant of sin? let it not be! 18for if the things I threw down, these again I build up, a transgressor I set myself forth; 19for I through law, did die, that to God I may live; 20with Christ I have been crucified, and live no more do I, and Christ doth live in me; and that which I now live in the flesh—in the faith I live of the Son of God, who did love me and"

Galatians,3,1,"O thoughtless Galatians, who did bewitch you, not to obey the truth—before whose eyes Jesus Christ was described before among you crucified? 2this only do I wish to learn from you—by works of law the Spirit did ye receive, or by the hearing of faith? 3so thoughtless are ye! having begun in the Spirit, now"
Galatians,3,5,"He, therefore, who is supplying to you the Spirit, and working mighty acts among you—by works of law or by the hearing of faith is it? 6according as Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him—to righteousness; 7know ye, then, that those of faith—these are sons of Abraham, 8and the Writing having foreseen that by faith God doth declare righteous the nations did proclaim before the good news to Abraham— 9‘Blessed in thee shall be all the nations;’ so that those of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham, Christ Has Redeemed Us 10for as many as are of works of law are under a curse, for it hath been written, ‘Cursed is every one who is not remaining in all things that have been written in the Book of the Law—to do them,’ 11and that in law no one is declared righteous with God, is evident, because ‘The righteous by faith shall live;’"
Galatians,3,13,"Christ did redeem us from the curse of the law, having become for us a curse, for it hath been written, ‘Cursed is every one who is hanging on a tree,’ 14that to the nations the blessing of Abraham may come in Christ Jesus, that the promise of the Spirit we may receive through the faith. The Purpose of the Law (Romans 7:1–6)"
Galatians,3,15,"Brethren, as a man I say it, even of man a confirmed covenant no one doth make void or doth add to, 16and to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed; He doth not say, ‘And to seeds,’ as of many, but as of one, ‘And to thy seed,’ which is Christ; 17and this I say, A covenant confirmed before by God to Christ, the law, that came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not set aside, to make void the promise, 18for if by law be the inheritance, it is no more by promise, but to Abraham through promise did God grant it."
Galatians,3,19,"Why, then, the law? on account of the transgressions it was added, till the seed might come to which the promise hath been made, having been set in order through messengers in the hand of a mediator— 20and the mediator is not of one, and God is one— 21the law, then, is against the promises of God?— let it not be! for if a law was given that was able to make alive, truly by law there would have been the righteousness, 22but the Writing did shut up the whole under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ may be given to those believing."
Galatians,3,23,"And before the coming of the faith, under law we were being kept, shut up to the faith about to be revealed, 24so that the law became our child-conductor—to Christ, that by faith we may be declared righteous, 25and the faith having come, no more under a child-conductor are we, Sons through Faith in Christ 26for ye are all sons of God through the faith in Christ Jesus, 27for as many as to Christ were baptized did put on Christ; 28there is not here Jew or Greek, there is not here servant nor freeman, there is not here male and female, for all ye are one in Christ Jesus; 29and if ye are of Christ then of Abraham ye are seed, and according to promise—heirs."
Galatians,4,1,"And I say, so long time as the heir is a babe, he differeth nothing from a servant—being lord of all, 2but is under tutors and stewards till the time appointed of the father, 3so also we, when we were babes, under the elements of the world were in servitude, 4and when the fulness of time did come, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law, 5that those under law he may redeem, that the adoption of sons we may receive; 6and because ye are sons, God did send forth the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, ‘Abba, Father!’ 7so that thou art no more a servant, but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ. Paul’s Concern for the Galatians"
Galatians,4,8,"But then, indeed, not having known God, ye were in servitude to those not by nature gods, 9and now, having known God—and rather being known by God—how turn ye again unto the weak and poor elements to which anew ye desire to be in servitude? 10days ye observe, and months, and times, and"
Galatians,4,11,"I am afraid of you, lest in vain I did labour toward you."
Galatians,4,12,"Become as I am—because I also am as ye brethren, I beseech you; to me ye did no hurt, 13and ye have known that through infirmity of the flesh I did proclaim good news to you at the first, 14and my trial that is in my flesh ye did not despise nor reject, but as a messenger of God ye did receive me—as Christ Jesus; 15what then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that if possible, your eyes having plucked out, ye would have given to me; 16so that your enemy have I become, being true to you? 17they are zealous for you—yet not well, but they wish to shut us out, that for them ye may be zealous; 18and it is good to be zealously regarded, in what is good, at all times, and not only in my being present with you; 19my little children, of whom again I travail in birth, till Christ may be formed in you, 20and I was wishing to be present with you now, and to change my voice, because I am in doubt about you. Hagar and Sarah (Genesis 21:9–21)"
Galatians,4,21,"Tell me, ye who are willing to be under law, the law do ye not hear? 22for it hath been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the maid-servant, and one by the free-woman, 23but he who is of the maid-servant, according to flesh hath been, and he who is of the free-woman, through the promise; 24which things are allegorized, for these are the two covenants: one, indeed, from mount Sinai, to servitude bringing forth, which is Hagar; 25for this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and doth correspond to the Jerusalem that now is, and is in servitude with her children, 26and the Jerusalem above is the free-woman, which is mother of us all, 27for it hath been written, ‘Rejoice, O barren, who art not bearing; break forth and cry, thou who art not travailing, because many are the children of the desolate—more than of her having the husband.’"
Galatians,4,28,"And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise, 29but as then he who was born according to the flesh did persecute him according to the spirit, so also now; 30but what saith the Writing? ‘Cast forth the maid-servant and her son, for the son of the maid-servant may not be heir with the son of the free-woman;’ 31then, brethren, we are not a maid-servant’s children, but the free-woman’s."
Galatians,5,1,"In the freedom, then, with which Christ did make you free—stand ye, and be not held fast again by a yoke of servitude; 2lo, I Paul do say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing; 3and I testify again to every man circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law; 4ye were freed from the Christ, ye who in law are declared righteous; from the grace ye fell away; 5for we by the Spirit, by faith, a hope of righteousness do wait for, 6for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith through love working."
Galatians,5,7,Ye were running well; who did hinder you—not to obey the truth? 8the obedience is not of him who
Galatians,5,10,"I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded; and he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment,"
Galatians,5,11,"And I, brethren, if uncircumcision I yet preach, why yet am I persecuted? then"
Galatians,5,12,O that even they would cut themselves off who are unsettling you!
Galatians,5,13,"For ye—to freedom ye were called, brethren, only not the freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through the love serve ye one another, 14for all the law in one word is fulfilled—in this: ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;’ 15and if one another ye do bite and devour, see—that ye may not by one another be consumed. Walking by the Spirit (Ezekiel 36:16–38; Romans 8:9–11)"
Galatians,5,16,"And I say: In the Spirit walk ye, and the desire of the flesh ye may not complete; 17for the flesh doth desire contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, and these are opposed one to another, that the things that ye may will—these ye may not do; 18and if by the Spirit ye are led, ye are not"
Galatians,5,19,"And manifest also are the works of the flesh, which are: Adultery, whoredom, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 20idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strifes, emulations, wraths, rivalries, dissensions, sects, 21envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revellings, and such like, of which I tell you"
Galatians,5,22,"And the fruit of the Spirit is: Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, 23meekness, temperance: against such there is no law; 24and those who are Christ’s, the flesh did crucify with the affections, and the desires; 25if we may live in the Spirit, in the Spirit also we may walk; 26let us not become vain-glorious—one another provoking, one another envying!"
Galatians,6,1,"Brethren, if a man also may be overtaken in any trespass, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself—lest thou also may be tempted; 2of one another the burdens bear ye, and so fill up the law of the Christ, 3for if any one doth think himself to be something—being nothing—himself he doth deceive; 4and his own work let each one prove, and then in regard to himself alone the glorying he shall have, and not in regard to the other, 5for each one his own burden shall bear."
Galatians,6,6,And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who is instructing—in all good things.
Galatians,6,7,"Be not led astray; God is not mocked; for what a man may sow—that also he shall reap, 8because he who is sowing to his own flesh, of the flesh shall reap corruption; and he who is sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap life age-during; 9and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted, for at the proper time we shall reap—not desponding; 10therefore, then, as we have opportunity, may we work the good to all, and especially unto those of the household of the faith. Final Warnings and Blessings"
Galatians,6,11,"Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand; 12as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised—only that for the cross of the Christ they may not be persecuted, 13for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law,"
Galatians,6,14,"And for me, let it not be—to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which to me the world hath been crucified, and I to the world; 15for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation; 16and as many as by this rule do walk—peace upon them, and kindness, and on the Israel of God!"
Galatians,6,17,"Henceforth, let no one give me trouble, for I the scars of the Lord Jesus in my body do bear."
Galatians,6,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit, brethren! Amen."

Ephesians,1,2,"Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ! Spiritual Blessings (Romans 8:28–34)"
Ephesians,1,3,"Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who did bless us in every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, 4according as He did choose us in him before the foundation of the world, for our being holy and unblemished before Him, in love, 5having foreordained us to the adoption of sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 6to the praise of the glory of His grace, in which He did make us accepted in the beloved, 7in whom we have the redemption through his blood, the remission of the trespasses, according to the riches of His grace, 8in which He did abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 9having made known to us the secret of His will, according to His good pleasure, that He purposed in Himself, 10in regard to the dispensation of the fulness of the times, to bring into one the whole in the Christ, both the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth—in him; 11in whom also we did obtain an inheritance, being foreordained according to the purpose of Him who the all things is working according to the counsel of His will, 12for our being to the praise of His glory, even those who did first hope in the Christ, 13in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth—the good news of your salvation—in whom also having believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise, 14which is an earnest of our inheritance, to the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory. Spiritual Wisdom (1 Corinthians 2:6–16)"
Ephesians,1,15,"Because of this I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and the love to all the saints, 16do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, 17that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of the glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the recognition of him, 18the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, for your knowing what is the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, 19and what the exceeding greatness of His power to us who are believing, according to the working of the power of His might, 20which He wrought in the Christ, having raised him out of the dead, and did set him at His right hand in the heavenly places, 21far above all principality, and authority, and might, and lordship, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in the coming one; 22and all things He did put under his feet, and did give him—head over all things to the assembly, 23which is his body, the fulness of Him who is filling the all in all,"
Ephesians,2,1,"Also you—being dead in the trespasses and the sins, 2in which once ye did walk according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience, 3among whom also we all did walk once in the desires of our flesh, doing the wishes of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath—as also the others, 4and God, being rich in kindness, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5even being dead in the trespasses, did make us to live together with the Christ, (by grace ye are having been saved,) 6and did raise us up together, and did seat us together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7that He might show, in the ages that are coming, the exceeding riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus, 8for by grace ye are having been saved, through faith, and this not of you—of God the gift, 9not of works, that no one may boast; 10for of Him we are workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God did before prepare, that in them we may walk. One in Christ (Philippians 2:1–4)"
Ephesians,2,11,"Wherefore, remember, that ye were once the nations in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that called Circumcision in the flesh made by hands, 12that ye were at that time apart from Christ, having been alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope, and without God, in the world; 13and now, in Christ Jesus, ye being once afar off became nigh in the blood of the Christ, 14for he is our peace, who did make both one, and the middle wall of the enclosure did break down, 15the enmity in his flesh, the law of the commands in ordinances having done away, that the two he might create in himself into one new man, making peace, 16and might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity in it, 17and having come, he did proclaim good news—peace to you—the far-off and the nigh, 18because through him we have the access—we both—in one Spirit unto the Father. Christ Our Cornerstone (Isaiah 28:14–22; 1 Corinthians 3:10–15; 1 Peter 2:1–8)"
Ephesians,2,19,"Then, therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God, 20being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being chief corner -stone, 21in whom all the building fitly framed together doth increase to an holy sanctuary in the Lord, 22in whom also ye are builded together, for a habitation of God in the Spirit."
Ephesians,3,1,"For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you the nations, 2if, indeed, ye did hear of the dispensation of the grace of God that was given to me in regard to you, 3that by revelation He made known to me the secret, according as I wrote before in few words— 4in regard to which ye are able, reading it, to understand my knowledge in the secret of the Christ, 5which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it was now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit— 6that the nations be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in the Christ, through the good news, 7of which I became a ministrant, according to the gift of the grace of God that was given to me, according to the working of His power; 8to me—the less than the least of all the saints—was given this grace, among the nations to proclaim good news—the untraceable riches of the Christ, 9and to cause all to see what is the fellowship of the secret that hath been hid from the ages in God, who the all things did create by Jesus Christ, 10that there might be made known now to the principalities and the authorities in the heavenly places, through the assembly, the manifold wisdom of God, 11according to a purpose of the ages, which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord, 12in whom we have the freedom and the access in confidence through the faith of him, 13wherefore, I ask you not to faint in my tribulations for you, which is your glory. Paul’s Prayer for the Ephesians"
Ephesians,3,14,"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15of whom the whole family in the heavens and on earth is named, 16that He may give to you, according to the riches of His glory, with might to be strengthened through His Spirit, in regard to the inner man, 17that the Christ may dwell through the faith in your hearts, in love having been rooted and founded, 18that ye may be in strength to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, 19to know also the love of the Christ that is exceeding the knowledge, that ye may be filled—to all the fulness of God; 20and to Him who is able above all things to do exceeding abundantly what we ask or think, according to the power that is working in us, 21to Him is the glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus, to all the generations of the age of the ages. Amen."
Ephesians,4,1,"Call upon you, then, do I—the prisoner of the Lord—to walk worthily of the calling with which ye were called, 2with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love, 3being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of the peace; 4one body and one Spirit, according as also ye were called in one hope of your calling; 5one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in you all, 7and to each one of you was given the grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ, 8wherefore, he saith, ‘Having gone up on high he led captive captivity, and gave gifts to men,’— 9and that, he went up, what is it except that he also went down first to the lower parts of the earth? 10he who went down is the same also who went up far above all the heavens, that He may fill all things— 11and He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as proclaimers of good news, and some as shepherds and teachers, 12unto the perfecting of the saints, for a work of ministration, for a building up of the body of the Christ, 13till we may all come to the unity of the faith and of the recognition of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to a measure of stature of the fulness of the Christ, 14that we may no more be babes, tossed and borne about by every wind of the teaching, in the sleight of men, in craftiness, unto the artifice of leading astray, 15and, being true in love, we may increase to Him in all things, who is the head—the Christ; 16from whom the whole body, being fitly joined together and united, through the supply of every joint, according to the working in the measure of each single part, the increase of the body doth make for the building up of itself in love. New Life in Christ (Colossians 3:1–17)"
Ephesians,4,17,"This, then, I say, and I testify in the Lord; ye are no more to walk, as also the other nations walk, in the vanity of their mind, 18being darkened in the understanding, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart, 19who, having ceased to feel, themselves did give up to the lasciviousness, for the working of all uncleanness in greediness; 20and ye did not so learn the Christ, 21if so be ye did hear him, and in him were taught, as truth is in Jesus; 22ye are to put off concerning the former behaviour the old man, that is corrupt according to the desires of the deceit, 23and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 24and to put on the new man, which, according to God, was created in righteousness and kindness of the truth."
Ephesians,4,25,"Wherefore, putting away the lying, speak truth each with his neighbour, because we are members one of another; 26be angry and do not sin; let not the sun go down upon your wrath, 27neither give place to the devil; 28whoso is stealing let him no more steal, but rather let him labour, working the"
Ephesians,4,29,"Let no corrupt word out of your mouth go forth, but what is good unto the needful building up, that it may give grace to the hearers; 30and make not sorrowful the Holy Spirit of God, in which ye were sealed to a day of"
Ephesians,4,31,"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice, 32and become one to another kind, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, according as also God in Christ did forgive you."
Ephesians,5,1,"Become, then, followers of God, as children beloved, 2and walk in love, as also the Christ did love us, and did give himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odour of a sweet smell, 3and whoredom, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints; 4also filthiness, and foolish talking, or jesting,—the things not fit—but rather thanksgiving; 5for this ye know, that every whoremonger, or unclean, or covetous person, who is an idolater, hath no inheritance in the reign of the Christ and God."
Ephesians,5,6,"Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience, 7become not, then, partakers with them, Children of Light 8for ye were once darkness, and now light in the Lord; as children of light walk ye, 9for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth, 10proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord, 11and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the darkness and rather even convict, 12for the things in secret done by them it is a shame even to speak of, 13and all the things reproved by the light are manifested, for everything that is manifested is light; 14wherefore he saith, ‘Arouse thyself, thou who art sleeping, and arise out of the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee.’"
Ephesians,5,15,"See, then, how exactly ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise, 16redeeming the time, because the days are evil; 17because of this become not fools, but—understanding what is the will of the Lord, 18and be not drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in the Spirit, 19speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, 20giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the God and Father; Wives and Husbands (Song of Solomon 1:1–17; 1 Peter 3:1–7) 21subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of God."
Ephesians,5,22,"The wives! to your own husbands subject yourselves, as to the Lord, 23because the husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ is head of the assembly, and he is saviour of the body, 24but even as the assembly is subject to Christ, so also are the wives to their own husbands in everything."
Ephesians,5,25,"The husbands! love your own wives, as also the Christ did love the assembly, and did give himself for it, 26that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it with the bathing of the water in the saying, 27that he might present it to himself the assembly in glory, not having spot or wrinkle, or any of such things, but that it may be holy and unblemished; 28so ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies: he who is loving his own wife—himself he doth love; 29for no one ever his own flesh did hate, but doth nourish and cherish it, as also the Lord—the assembly, 30because members we are of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones; 31‘for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they shall be—the two—for one flesh;’ 32this secret is great, and I speak in regard to Christ and to the assembly; 33but ye also, every one in particular—let each his own wife so love as himself, and the wife—that she may reverence the husband."
Ephesians,6,1,"The children! obey your parents in the Lord, for this is righteous; 2honour thy father and mother, 3which is the first command with a promise, ‘That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live a long time upon the land.’"
Ephesians,6,4,"And the fathers! provoke not your children, but nourish them in the instruction and admonition of the Lord. Serving with Honor (Colossians 3:22–25; 1 Timothy 6:1–2)"
Ephesians,6,5,"The servants! obey the masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to the Christ; 6not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as servants of the Christ, doing the will of God out of soul, 7with good-will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men, 8having known that whatever good thing each one may do, this he shall receive from the Lord, whether servant or freeman."
Ephesians,6,9,"And the masters! the same things do ye unto them, letting threatening alone, having known that also your Master is in the heavens, and acceptance of persons is not with him. The Full Armor of God"
Ephesians,6,10,"As to the rest, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might; 11put on the whole armour of God, for your being able to stand against the wiles of the devil, 12because we have not the wrestling with blood and flesh, but with the principalities, with the authorities, with the world-rulers of the darkness of this age, with the spiritual things of the evil in the heavenly places; 13because of this take ye up the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to resist in the day of the evil, and all things"
Ephesians,6,14,"Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about in truth, and having put on the breastplate of the righteousness, 15and having the feet shod in the preparation of the good-news of the peace; 16above all, having taken up the shield of the faith, in which ye shall be able all the fiery darts of the evil one to quench, 17and the helmet of the salvation receive, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the saying of God, 18through all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the Spirit, and in regard to this same, watching in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints— 19and in behalf of me, that to me may be given a word in the opening of my mouth, in freedom, to make known the secret of the good news, 20for which I am an ambassador in a chain, that in it I may speak freely—as it behoveth me to speak. Final Greetings (Philippians 4:21–23; 2 Timothy 4:19–22)"
Ephesians,6,21,"And that ye may know—ye also—the things concerning me—what I do, all things make known to you shall Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful ministrant in the Lord, 22whom I did send unto you for this very thing, that ye might know the things concerning us, and that he might comfort your hearts."
Ephesians,6,23,"Peace to the brethren, and love, with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
Ephesians,6,24,The grace with all those loving our Lord Jesus Christ—undecayingly! Amen.

Philippians,1,2,"Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Thanksgiving and Prayer (1 Corinthians 1:4–9; Colossians 1:3–14)"
Philippians,1,3,"I give thanks to my God upon all the remembrance of you, 4always, in every supplication of mine for you all, with joy making the supplication, 5for your contribution to the good news from the first day till now, 6having been confident of this very thing, that He who did begin in you a good work, will perform it till a day of Jesus Christ, 7according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf of you all, because of my having you in the heart, both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the good"
Philippians,1,8,"For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ, 9and this I pray, that your love yet more and more may abound in full knowledge, and all judgment, 10for your proving the things that differ, that ye may be pure and offenceless—to a day of Christ, 11being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that is through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. Paul’s Trials Advance the Gospel (James 1:2–12)"
Philippians,1,12,"And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me, rather to an advancement of the good news have come, 13so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole praetorium, and to the other places—all, 14and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence by"
Philippians,1,15,"Certain, indeed, even through envy and contention, and certain also through good-will, do preach the Christ; 16the one, indeed, of rivalry the Christ do proclaim, not purely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds, 17and the other out of love, having known that for defence of the good news I am set: 18what then? in every way, whether"
Philippians,1,19,"For I have known that this shall fall out to me for salvation, through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Christ Jesus, 20according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, and in all freedom, as always, also now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death, To Live Is Christ"
Philippians,1,22,"And if to live in the flesh is to me a fruit of work, then what shall I choose? I know not; 23for I am pressed by the two, having the desire to depart, and to be with Christ, for it is far better, 24and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account, 25and of this being persuaded, I have known that I shall remain and continue with you all, to your advancement and joy of the faith, 26that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence again to you. Worthy of the Gospel"
Philippians,1,27,"Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct ye yourselves, that, whether having come and seen you, whether being absent I may hear of the things concerning you, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul, striving together for the faith of the good news, 28and not terrified in anything by those opposing, which to them indeed is a token of destruction, and to you of salvation, and that from God; 29because to you it was granted, on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also on behalf of him to suffer; 30the same conflict having, such as ye saw in me, and now hear of in me."
Philippians,2,1,"If, then, any exhortation is in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 2fulfil ye my joy, that ye may mind the same thing—having the same love—of one soul— minding the one thing, 3nothing in rivalry or vain-glory, but in humility of mind one another counting more excellent than yourselves— 4each not to your own look ye, but each also to the things of others. The Mind of Christ (Isaiah 52:13–15)"
Philippians,2,5,"For, let this mind be in you that is also in Christ Jesus, 6who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal to God, 7but did empty himself, the form of a servant having taken, in the likeness of men having been made, 8and in fashion having been found as a man, he humbled himself, having become obedient unto death—death even of a cross, 9wherefore, also, God did highly exalt him, and gave to him a name that is above every name, 10that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow—of heavenlies, and earthlies, and what are under the earth— 11and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Lights in the World (Matthew 5:13–16)"
Philippians,2,12,"So that, my beloved, as ye always obey, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and trembling your own salvation work out, 13for God it is who is working in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure."
Philippians,2,14,"All things do without murmurings and reasonings, 15that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God, unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverse, among whom ye do appear as luminaries in the world, 16the word of life holding forth, for rejoicing to me in regard to a day of Christ, that not in vain did I run, nor in vain did I labour; 17but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and joy with you all, 18because of this do ye also rejoice and joy with me. Timothy and Epaphroditus (1 Corinthians 16:10–12)"
Philippians,2,19,"And I hope, in the Lord Jesus, Timotheus to send quickly to you, that I also may be of good spirit, having known the things concerning you, 20for I have no one like-minded, who sincerely for the things concerning you will care, 21for the whole seek their own things, not the things of the Christ Jesus, 22and the proof of him ye know, that as a child serveth a father, with me he did serve in regard to the good news; 23him, indeed, therefore, I hope to send, when I may see through the things concerning me—immediately; 24and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly come."
Philippians,2,25,"And I thought it necessary Epaphroditus—my brother, and fellow-workman, and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and servant to my need—to send unto you, 26seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness, because ye heard that he ailed, 27for he also ailed nigh to death, but God did deal kindly"
Philippians,2,28,"The more eagerly, therefore, I did send him, that having seen him again ye may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful; 29receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and hold such in honour, 30because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near to death, having hazarded the life that he might fill up your deficiency of service unto me."
Philippians,3,1,"As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord; the same things to write to you to me indeed is not tiresome, and for you is sure; 2look to the dogs, look to the evil-workers, look to the concision; 3for we are the circumcision, who by the Spirit are serving God, and glorying in Christ Jesus, and in flesh having no trust, 4though I also have cause of trust in flesh. If any other one doth think to have trust in flesh, I more; 5circumcision on the eighth day! of the race of Israel! of the tribe of Benjamin! a Hebrew of Hebrews! according to law a Pharisee! 6according to zeal persecuting the assembly! according to righteousness that is in law becoming blameless!"
Philippians,3,7,"But what things were to me gains, these I have counted, because of the Christ, loss; 8yes, indeed, and I count all things to be loss, because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, because of whom of the all things I suffered loss, and do count them to be refuse, that Christ I may gain, and be found in him, 9not having my righteousness, which is of law, but that which is through faith of Christ—the righteousness that is of God by the faith, 10to know him, and the power of his rising again, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death, 11if anyhow I may attain to the rising again of the dead. Pressing on toward the Goal"
Philippians,3,12,"Not that I did already obtain, or have been already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by the Christ Jesus; 13brethren, I do not reckon myself to have laid hold; and one thing—the things behind indeed forgetting, and to the things before stretching"
Philippians,3,15,"As many, therefore, as are perfect—let us think this, and if in anything ye think otherwise, this also shall God reveal to you, 16but to what we have come—by the same rule walk, the same thing think; Citizenship in Heaven 17become followers together of me, brethren, and observe those thus walking, according as ye have us—a pattern; 18for many walk of whom many times I told you—and now also weeping tell—the enemies of the cross of the Christ! 19whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory"
Philippians,3,20,"For our citizenship is in the heavens, whence also a Saviour we await—the Lord Jesus Christ— 21who shall transform the body of our humiliation to its becoming conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working of his power, even to subject to himself the all things."
Philippians,4,1,"So then, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand ye in the Lord, beloved."
Philippians,4,2,"Euodia I exhort, and Syntyche I exhort, to be of the same mind in the Lord; 3and I ask also thee, genuine yoke-fellow, be assisting those women who in the good news did strive along with me, with Clement also, and the others, my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life."
Philippians,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice; 5let your forbearance be known to all men; the Lord is near; 6for nothing be anxious, but in everything by prayer, and by supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God; 7and the peace of God, that is surpassing all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus."
Philippians,4,8,"As to the rest, brethren, as many things as are true, as many as are grave, as many as are righteous, as many as are pure, as many as are lovely, as many as are of good report, if any worthiness, and if any praise, these things think upon; 9the things that also ye did learn, and receive, and hear, and saw in me, those do, and the God of the peace shall be with you. The Generosity of the Philippians (2 Corinthians 8:1–15)"

Philippians,4,13,"For all things I have strength, in Christ’s strengthening me; 14but ye did well, having communicated with my tribulation; 15and ye have known, even ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news when I went forth from Macedonia, no assembly did communicate with me in regard to giving and receiving except ye only; 16because also in Thessalonica, both once and again to my need ye sent; 17not that I seek after the gift, but I seek after the fruit that is overflowing to your account; 18and I have all things, and abound; I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you—an odour of a sweet smell—a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God: 19and my God shall supply all your need, according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus; 20and to God, even our Father, is the glory—to the ages of the ages.

Colossians,1,3,"We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying for you, 4having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love that is to all the saints, 5because of the hope that is laid up for you in the heavens, which ye heard of before in the word of the truth of the good news, 6which is present to you, as also in all the world, and is bearing fruit, as also in you, from the day in which ye heard, and knew the grace of God in truth; 7as ye also learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow- servant, who is for you a faithful ministrant of the Christ, 8who also did declare to us your love in the Spirit."

Paul’s Suffering for the Church (2 Corinthians 11:16–33)"
Colossians,1,24,"I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and do fill up the things lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the assembly, 25of which I—I did become a ministrant according to the dispensation of God, that was given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God, 26the secret that hath been hid from the ages and from the generations, but now was manifested to his saints, 27to whom God did will to make known what is the riches of the glory of this secret among the nations—which is Christ in you, the hope of the glory, 28whom we proclaim, warning every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus, 29for which also I labour, striving according to his working that is working in me in power."
Colossians,2,1,"For I wish you to know how great a conflict I have for you and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, 2that their hearts may be comforted, being united in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of the understanding, to the full knowledge of the secret of the God and Father, and of the Christ, 3in whom are all the treasures of the wisdom and the knowledge hid, 4and this I say, that no one may beguile you in enticing words, 5for if even in the flesh I am absent—yet in the spirit I am with you, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in regard to Christ; Alive with Christ (Ephesians 2:1–10) 6as, then, ye did receive Christ Jesus the Lord, in him walk ye, 7being rooted and built up in him, and confirmed in the faith, as ye were taught—abounding in it in thanksgiving."
Colossians,2,8,"See that no one shall be carrying you away as spoil through the philosophy and vain deceit, according to the deliverance of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to Christ, 9because in him doth tabernacle all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, 10and ye are in him made full, who is the head of all principality and authority, 11in whom also ye were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh in the circumcision of the Christ, 12being buried with him in the baptism, in which also ye rose with him through the faith of the"
Colossians,2,13,"And you—being dead in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh—He made alive together with him, having forgiven you all the trespasses, 14having blotted out the handwriting in the ordinances that is against us, that was contrary to us, and he hath taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross; 15having stripped the principalities and the authorities, he made a shew of them openly—having triumphed over them in it."
Colossians,2,16,"Let no one, then, judge you in eating or in drinking, or in respect of a feast, or of a new moon, or of sabbaths, 17which are a shadow of the coming things, and the body is of the Christ; 18let no one beguile you of your prize, delighting in humble-mindedness and in worship of the messengers, intruding into the things he hath not seen, being vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh, 19and not holding the head, from which all the body—through the joints and bands gathering supply, and being knit together—may increase with the increase of God."
Colossians,2,20,"If, then, ye did die with the Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances? 21—thou mayest not touch, nor taste, nor handle— 22which are all for destruction with the using, after the commands and teachings of men, 23which are, indeed, having a matter of wisdom in will-worship, and humble-mindedness, and neglecting of body—not in any honour, unto a satisfying of the flesh."
Colossians,3,1,"If, then, ye were raised with the Christ, the things above seek ye, where the Christ is, on the right hand of God seated, 2the things above mind ye, not the things upon the earth, 3for ye did die, and your life hath been hid with the Christ in God; 4when the Christ—our life—may be manifested, then also we with him shall be manifested in glory."
Colossians,3,5,"Put to death, then, your members that are upon the earth—whoredom, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and the covetousness, which is idolatry— 6because of which things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience, 7in which also ye—ye did walk once, when ye lived in them; 8but now put off, even ye, the whole—anger, wrath, malice, evil-speaking, filthy talking—out of your mouth."
Colossians,3,9,"Lie not one to another, having put off the old man with his practices, 10and having put on the new, which is renewed in regard to knowledge, after the image of Him who did create him; 11where there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, servant, freeman—but the all and in all—Christ."
Colossians,3,12,"Put on, therefore, as choice ones of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humble- mindedness, meekness, long-suffering, 13forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any one with any one may have a quarrel, as also the Christ did forgive you—so also ye; 14and above all these things, have love, which is a bond of the perfection, 15and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to"
Colossians,3,16,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing each other, in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, in grace singing in your hearts to the Lord; 17and all, whatever ye may do in word or in work, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus—giving thanks to the God and Father, through him. Christian Households (Ephesians 6:1–4)"
Colossians,3,18,"The wives! be subject to your own husbands, as is fit in the Lord; 19the husbands! love your wives, and be not bitter with them; 20the children! obey the parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord; 21the fathers! vex not your children, lest they be discouraged. Serving with Honor (Ephesians 6:5–9; 1 Timothy 6:1–2)"
Colossians,3,22,"The servants! obey in all things those who are masters according to the flesh, not in eye-service as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God; 23and all, whatever ye may do—out of soul work— as to the Lord, and not to men, 24having known that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance—for the Lord Christ ye serve; 25and he who is doing unrighteously shall receive what he did unrighteously, and there is no acceptance of persons."
Colossians,4,1,"The masters! that which is righteous and equal to the servants give ye, having known that ye also have a Master in the heavens."
Colossians,4,2,"In the prayer continue ye, watching in it in thanksgiving; 3praying at the same time also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the secret of the Christ, because of which also I have been bound, 4that I may manifest it, as it behoveth me to speak; 5in wisdom walk ye toward those without, the time forestalling; 6your word always in grace—with salt being seasoned—to know how it behoveth you to answer each one. Greetings from Paul’s Fellow Workers (Romans 16:21–23)"
Colossians,4,7,"All the things concerning me make known to you shall Tychicus—the beloved brother, and faithful ministrant, and fellow-servant in the Lord— 8whom I did send unto you for this very thing, that he might know the things concerning you, and might comfort your hearts, 9with Onesimus the faithful and beloved brother, who is of you; all things to you shall they make known that are here."
Colossians,4,10,"Salute you doth Aristarchus, my fellow-captive, and Marcus, the nephew of Barnabas, (concerning whom ye did receive commands—if he may come unto you receive him,) 11and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these only are fellow-workers for the reign of God who did become"
Colossians,4,12,"Salute you doth Epaphras, who is of you, a servant of Christ, always striving for you in the prayers, that ye may stand perfect and made full in all the will of God, 13for I do testify to"
Colossians,4,14,"Salute you doth Lukas, the beloved physician, and Demas; Signature and Final Instructions (1 Corinthians 16:19–24; 2 Thessalonians 3:16–18) 15salute ye those in Laodicea—brethren, and Nymphas, and the assembly in his house; 16and when the epistle may be read with you, cause that also in the assembly of the Laodiceans it may be read, and the epistle from Laodicea that ye also may read; 17and say to Archippus, ‘See to the ministration that thou didst receive in the Lord, that thou mayest fulfil it.’"
Colossians,4,18,"The salutation by the hand of me, Paul; remember my bonds; the grace is with you. Amen."
1 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
1 Thessalonians,1,2,"We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers, 3unceasingly remembering of you the work of the faith, and the labour of the love, and the endurance of the hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father, 4having known, brethren beloved, by God, your election, 5because our good news did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, even as ye have known of what sort we became among you because of you, 6and ye—ye did become imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Spirit, 7so that ye became patterns to all those believing in Macedonia and Achaia, 8for from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God did go forth, so that we have no need to say anything, 9for they themselves concerning us do declare what entrance we had unto you, and how ye did turn unto God from the idols, to serve a living and true God, 10and to wait for His Son from the heavens, whom He did raise out of the dead—Jesus, who is rescuing us from the anger that is coming."
1 Thessalonians,2,1,"For yourselves have known, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it did not become vain, 2but having both suffered before, and having been injuriously treated (as ye have known) in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the good news of God in much conflict, 3for our exhortation is not out of deceit, nor out of uncleanness, nor in guile, 4but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who is proving our hearts, 5for at no time did we come with speech of flattery, (as ye have known,) nor in a pretext for covetousness, (God is witness!) 6nor seeking of men glory, neither from you nor from others, being"
1 Thessalonians,2,7,"But we became gentle in your midst, as a nurse may cherish her own children, 8so being desirous of you, we are well-pleased to impart to you not only the good news of God, but also our own souls, because beloved ye have become to us, 9for ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail, for, night and day working not to be a burden upon any of you, we did preach to you the good news of God; 10ye are witnesses—God also—how kindly and righteously, and blamelessly to you who believe we became, 11even as ye have known, how each one of you, as a father his own children, we are exhorting you, and comforting, and testifying, 12for your walking worthily of God, who is calling you to His own reign and glory."
1 Thessalonians,2,13,"Because of this also, we—we do give thanks to God continually, that, having received the word of hearing from us of God, ye accepted, not the word of man, but as it is truly, the word of God, who also doth work in you who believe; 14for ye became imitators, brethren, of the assemblies of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because such things ye suffered, even ye, from your own countrymen, as also they from the Jews, 15who did both put to death the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and did persecute us, and God they are not pleasing, and to all men are contrary, 16forbidding us to speak to the nations that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always, but the anger did come upon them— to the end! Paul’s Longing to Visit"
1 Thessalonians,2,17,"And we, brethren, having been taken from you for the space of an hour—in presence, not in heart— did hasten the more abundantly to see your face in much desire, 18wherefore we wished to come unto you, (I indeed Paul,) both once and again, and the Adversary did hinder us; 19for what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? are not even ye before our Lord Jesus Christ in his presence? 20for ye are our glory and joy."
1 Thessalonians,3,1,"Wherefore no longer forbearing, we thought good to be left in Athens alone, 2and did send Timotheus—our brother, and a ministrant of God, and our fellow-workman in the good news of the Christ—to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith, 3that no one be moved in these tribulations, for yourselves have known that for this we are set, 4for even when we were with you, we said to you beforehand, that we are about to suffer tribulation, as also it did come to pass, and ye have known it; 5because of this also, I, no longer forbearing, did send to know your faith, lest he who is tempting did tempt you, and in vain might be our labour. Timothy’s Encouraging Report"
1 Thessalonians,3,6,"And now Timotheus having come unto us from you, and having declared good news to us of your faith and love, and that ye have a good remembrance of us always, desiring much to see us, as we also to see you, 7because of this we were comforted, brethren, over you, in all our tribulation and necessity, through your faith, 8because now we live, if ye may stand fast in the Lord; 9for what thanks are we able to recompense to God for you, for all the joy with which we do joy because of you in the presence of our God? 10night and day exceedingly beseeching, that we might see your face, and perfect the things lacking in your faith."
1 Thessalonians,3,11,"And our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you, 12and you the Lord cause to increase and to abound in the love to one another, and to all, even as we also to you, 13to the establishing your hearts blameless in sanctification before our God and Father, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints."
1 Thessalonians,4,1,"As to the rest, then, brethren, we request you, and call upon you in the Lord Jesus, as ye did receive from us how it behoveth you to walk and to please God, that ye may abound the more, 2for ye have known what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus, 3for this is the will of God—your sanctification; that ye abstain from the whoredom, 4that each of you know his own vessel to possess in sanctification and honour, 5not in the affection of desire, as also the nations that were not knowing God, 6that no one go beyond and defraud in the matter his brother, because an avenger is the Lord of all these, as also we spake before to you and testified, 7for God did not call us on uncleanness, but in sanctification; 8he, therefore, who is despising—doth not despise man, but God, who also did give His Holy Spirit to us."
1 Thessalonians,4,9,"And concerning the brotherly love, ye have no need of my writing to you, for ye yourselves are God- taught to love one another, 10for ye do it also to all the brethren who are in all Macedonia; and we call upon you, brethren, to abound still more, 11and to study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we did command you, 12that ye may walk becomingly unto those without, and may have lack of nothing. The Return of the Lord"
1 Thessalonians,4,13,"And I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, that ye may not sorrow, as also the rest who have not hope, 14for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also God those asleep through Jesus he will bring with him, 15for this to you we say in the word of the Lord, that we who are living—who do remain over to the presence of the Lord—may not precede those asleep, 16because the Lord himself, in a shout, in the voice of a chief-messenger, and in the trump of God, shall come down from heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, 17then we who are living, who are remaining over, together with them shall be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in air, and so always with the Lord we shall be; 18so, then, comfort ye one another in these words."
1 Thessalonians,5,1,"And concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need of my writing to you, 2for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the Lord as a thief in the night doth so come, 3for when they may say, Peace and surety, then sudden destruction doth stand by them, as the travail doth her who is with child, and they shall not escape; 4and ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may catch you as a thief; 5all ye are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of darkness, 6so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and be sober, 7for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and those making themselves drunk, by night are drunken, 8and we, being of the day—let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet—a hope of salvation, 9because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 10who did die for us, that whether we wake—whether we sleep—together with him we may live; 11wherefore, comfort ye one another, and build ye up, one the one, as also ye do. Christian Living"
1 Thessalonians,5,12,"And we ask you, brethren, to know those labouring among you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you, 13and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of their work; be at peace among yourselves; 14and we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the feeble- minded, support the infirm, be patient unto all; 15see no one evil for evil may render to any one, but always that which is good pursue ye, both to one another and to all; 16always rejoice ye; 17continually"
1 Thessalonians,5,19,"The Spirit quench not; 20prophesyings despise not; 21all things prove; that which is good hold fast; 22from all appearance of evil abstain ye; Final Blessings and Instructions 23and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ; 24stedfast is He who is calling you, who also will do it."
1 Thessalonians,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us;"
1 Thessalonians,5,27,"I charge you by the Lord, that the letter be read to all the holy brethren; 28the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you! Amen."
2 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord"
2 Thessalonians,1,2,"Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
2 Thessalonians,1,3,"We ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because increase greatly doth your faith, and abound doth the love of each one of you all, to one another; 4so that we ourselves do glory in you in the assemblies of God, for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye bear; Christ’s Coming 5a token of the righteous judgment of God, for your being counted worthy of the reign of God, for which also ye suffer, 6since it is a righteous thing with God to give back to those troubling you—trouble, 7and to you who are troubled—rest with us in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with messengers of his power, 8in flaming fire, giving vengeance to those not knowing God, and to those not obeying the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ; 9who shall suffer justice—destruction age-during— from the face of the Lord, and from the glory of his strength, 10when He may come to be glorified in his saints, and to be wondered at in all those believing—because our testimony was believed among you—in that day; 11for which also we do pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of the calling, and may fulfil all the good pleasure of goodness, and the work of the faith in power, 12that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,1,"And we ask you, brethren, in regard to the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of our gathering together unto him, 2that ye be not quickly shaken in mind, nor be troubled, neither through spirit, neither through word, neither through letters as through us, as that the day of Christ hath arrived; 3let not any one deceive you in any manner, because—if the falling away may not come first, and the man of sin be revealed—the son of the destruction, 4who is opposing and is raising himself up above all called God or worshipped, so that he in the sanctuary of God as God hath sat down, shewing himself"
2 Thessalonians,2,5,"Do ye not remember that, being yet with you, these things I said to you? 6and now, what is keeping down ye have known, for his being revealed in his own time, 7for the secret of the lawlessness doth already work, only he who is keeping down now will hinder— till he may be out of the way, 8and then shall be revealed the Lawless One, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the manifestation of his presence, 9him, whose presence is according to the working of the Adversary, in all power, and signs, and lying wonders, 10and in all deceitfulness of the unrighteousness in those perishing, because the love of the truth they did not receive for their being saved, 11and because of this shall God send to them a working of delusion, for their believing the lie, 12that they may be judged—all who did not believe the truth, but were well pleased in the unrighteousness. Stand Firm"
2 Thessalonians,2,13,"And we—we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved by the Lord, that God did choose you from the beginning to salvation, in sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, 14to which He did call you through our good news, to the acquiring of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ; 15so, then, brethren, stand ye fast, and hold the deliverances that ye were taught, whether through word, whether through our letter; 16and may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father, who did love us, and did give comfort age-during, and good hope in grace, 17comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work."
2 Thessalonians,3,1,"As to the rest, pray ye, brethren, concerning us, that the word of the Lord may run and may be glorified, as also with you, 2and that we may be delivered from the unreasonable and evil men, for the faith is not of all; 3and stedfast is the Lord, who shall establish you, and shall guard you from the evil; 4and we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that the things that we command you ye both do and will do; 5and the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to the endurance of the Christ. A Warning against Idleness"
2 Thessalonians,3,6,"And we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother disorderly walking, and not after the deliverance that ye received from us, 7for yourselves have known how it behoveth you to imitate us, because we did not act disorderly among you; 8nor for nought did we eat bread of any one, but in labour and in travail, night and day working, not to be chargeable to any of you; 9not because we have not authority, but that ourselves a pattern we might give to you, to imitate us; 10for even when we were with you, this we did command you, that if any one is not willing to work, neither let him eat, 11for we hear of certain walking among you disorderly, nothing working, but over working, 12and such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness working, their own bread they may eat; 13and ye, brethren, may ye not be weary doing well, 14and if any one do not obey our word through the letter, this one note ye, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed, 15and as an enemy count him not, but admonish ye him as a brother; Signature and Final Greetings (1 Corinthians 16:19–24; Colossians 4:15–18) 16and may the Lord of the peace Himself give to you the peace always in every way; the Lord is with you all!"
2 Thessalonians,3,17,"The salutation by the hand of me, Paul, which is a sign in every letter; thus I write; 18the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you all! Amen."
1 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to a command of God our Saviour, and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope, 2to Timotheus—genuine child in faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord, Correcting False Teachers (Titus 1:10–16) 3according as I did exhort thee to remain in Ephesus—I going on to Macedonia—that thou mightest charge certain not to teach any other thing, 4nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that"
1 Timothy,1,5,"And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned, 6from which certain, having swerved, did turn aside to vain discourse, 7willing to be teachers of law, not understanding either the things they say, nor concerning what they asseverate, 8and we have known that the law is good, if any one may use it lawfully; 9having known this, that for a righteous man law is not set, but for lawless and insubordinate persons, ungodly and sinners, impious and profane, parricides and matricides, men-slayers, 10whoremongers, sodomites, men-stealers, liars, perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that to sound doctrine is adverse, 11according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted. God’s Grace to Paul"
1 Timothy,1,12,"And I give thanks to him who enabled me—Christ Jesus our Lord—that he did reckon me stedfast, having put me to the ministration, 13who before was speaking evil, and persecuting, and insulting, but I found kindness, because, being ignorant, I did it in unbelief, 14and exceedingly abound did the grace of our Lord, with faith and love that is in Christ Jesus: 15stedfast is the word, and of all acceptation worthy, that Christ Jesus came to the world to save sinners—first of whom I am; 16but because of this I found kindness, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern of those about to believe on him to life age-during: 17and to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only wise God, is honour and glory—to the ages of the ages! Amen."
1 Timothy,1,18,"This charge I commit to thee, child Timotheus, according to the prophesies that went before upon thee, that thou mayest war in them the good warfare, 19having faith and a good conscience, which certain having thrust away, concerning the faith did make shipwreck, 20of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I did deliver to the Adversary, that they might be instructed not to speak evil."
1 Timothy,2,1,"I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men: 2for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity, 3for this is right and acceptable before God our Saviour, 4who doth will all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth; 5for one is God, one also is mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus, 6who did give himself a ransom for all—the testimony in its own times— 7in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle—truth I say in Christ, I do not lie—a teacher of nations, in faith and truth."
1 Timothy,2,8,"I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning; Instructions to Women 9in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price, 10but—which becometh women"
1 Timothy,2,11,"Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection, 12and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness, 13for Adam was first formed, then Eve, 14and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came, 15and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety."
1 Timothy,3,1,"Stedfast is the word: If any one the oversight doth long for, a right work he desireth; 2it behoveth, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, of one wife a husband, vigilant, sober, decent, a friend of strangers, apt to teach, 3not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money, 4his own house leading well, having children in subjection with all gravity, 5(and if any one his own house how to lead hath not known, how an assembly of God shall he take care of?) 6not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the devil; 7and it behoveth him also to have a good testimony from those without, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil. Qualifications for Deacons (Acts 6:1–7)"
1 Timothy,3,8,"Ministrants—in like manner grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not given to filthy lucre, 9having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience, 10and let these also first be proved, then let"
1 Timothy,3,11,"Women—in like manner grave, not false accusers, vigilant, faithful"
1 Timothy,3,12,"Ministrants—let them be of one wife husbands; the children leading well, and their own houses, 13for those who did minister well a good step to themselves do acquire, and much boldness in faith that is in Christ Jesus. The Mystery of Godliness"
1 Timothy,3,14,"These things I write to thee, hoping to come unto thee soon, 15and if I delay, that thou mayest know how it behoveth thee to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is an assembly of the living God— a pillar and foundation of the truth, 16and, confessedly, great is the secret of piety—God was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory!"
1 Timothy,4,1,"And the Spirit expressly speaketh, that in latter times shall certain fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons, 2in hypocrisy speaking lies, being seared in their own conscience, 3forbidding to marry—to abstain from meats that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing and acknowledging the truth, 4because every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, with thanksgiving being received, 5for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession. A Good Servant of Jesus Christ"
1 Timothy,4,6,"These things placing before the brethren, thou shalt be a good ministrant of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of the faith, and of the good teaching, which thou didst follow after, 7and the profane and old women’s fables reject thou, and exercise thyself unto piety, 8for the bodily exercise is unto little profit, and the piety is to all things profitable, a promise having of the life that now is, and of that which is coming; 9stedfast is the word, and of all acceptation worthy; 10for for this we both labour and are reproached, because we hope on the living God, who is Saviour of all men—especially of those believing."
1 Timothy,4,11,"Charge these things, and teach; 12let no one despise thy youth, but a pattern become thou of those believing in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity; 13till I come, give heed to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching; 14be not careless of the gift in thee, that was given thee through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the eldership; 15of these things be careful; in these things be, that thy advancement may be manifest in all things; 16take heed to thyself, and to the teaching; remain in them, for this thing doing, both thyself thou shalt save, and those hearing thee."
1 Timothy,5,1,"An aged person thou mayest not rebuke, but be entreating as a father; younger persons as brethren; 2aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters—in all purity; Honoring True Widows (Ruth 1:1–5) 3honour widows who are really widows; 4and if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them learn first to their own house to show piety, and to give back a recompense to the parents, for this is"
1 Timothy,5,5,"And she who is really a widow and desolate, hath hoped upon God, and doth remain in the supplications and in the prayers night and day, 6and she who is given to luxury, living—hath died; 7and these things charge, that they may be blameless; 8and if any one for his own— and especially for those of the household—doth not provide, the faith he hath denied, and than an unbeliever he is worse."
1 Timothy,5,9,"A widow—let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age, having been a wife of one husband, 10in good works being testified to: if she brought up children, if she entertained strangers, if saints’ feet she washed, if those in tribulation she relieved, if every good work she followed after; 11and younger widows be refusing, for when they may revel against the Christ, they wish to marry, 12having judgment, because the first faith they did cast away, 13and at the same time also, they learn to be idle, going about the houses; and not only idle, but also tattlers and busybodies, speaking the things they ought"
1 Timothy,5,14,"I wish, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children, to be mistress of the house, to give"
1 Timothy,5,16,"If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the assembly be burdened, that those really widows it may relieve. Honoring Elders"
1 Timothy,5,17,"The well-leading elders of double honour let them be counted worthy, especially those labouring in word and teaching, 18for the Writing saith, ‘An ox treading out thou shalt not muzzle,’ and ‘Worthy is"
1 Timothy,5,19,"Against an elder an accusation receive not, except upon two or three"
1 Timothy,5,20,"Those sinning, reprove before all, that the others also may have fear; A Charge to Timothy"
1 Timothy,5,21,"I testify fully, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the choice messengers, that these things"
1 Timothy,5,22,"Be laying hands quickly on no one, nor be having fellowship with sins of others; be keeping thyself pure; 23no longer be drinking water, but a little wine be using, because of thy stomach and of thine often infirmities; 24of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand, leading before to judgment, and certain also they follow after; 25in like manner also the right works are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be hid."
1 Timothy,6,1,"As many as are servants under a yoke, their own masters worthy of all honour let them reckon, that the name of God and the teaching may not be evil spoken of; 2and those having believing masters, let them not slight them, because they are brethren, but rather let them serve, because they are stedfast and beloved, who of the benefit are partaking. These things be teaching and exhorting; Reject False Doctrines 3if any one be teaching otherwise, and do not consent to sound words—those of our Lord Jesus Christ— and to the teaching according to piety, 4he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and word-striving, out of which doth come envy, strife, evil-speakings, evil-surmisings, 5wranglings of men wholly corrupted in mind, and destitute of the truth, supposing the piety to be gain; depart from such; Godliness with Contentment 6but it is great gain—the piety with contentment; 7for nothing did we bring into the world—it is manifest that we are able to carry nothing out; 8but having food and raiment—with these we shall suffice ourselves; 9and those wishing to be rich, do fall into temptation and a snare, and many desires, foolish and hurtful, that sink men into ruin and destruction, 10for a root of all the evils is the love of money, which certain longing for did go astray from the faith, and themselves did pierce through with many sorrows; Fight the Good Fight 11and thou, O man of God, these things flee, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness; 12be striving the good strife of the faith, be laying hold on the life age-during, to which also"
1 Timothy,6,13,"I charge thee, before God, who is making all things alive, and of Christ Jesus, who did testify before Pontius Pilate the right profession, 14that thou keep the command unspotted, unblameable, till the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15which in His own times He shall shew—the blessed and only potentate, the King of the kings and Lord of the lords, 16who only is having immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no one of men did see, nor is able to see, to whom is honour and might age-during! Amen. A Charge to the Rich (Proverbs 23:1–5; James 5:1–6)"
1 Timothy,6,17,"Those rich in the present age charge thou not to be high-minded, nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who is giving to us all things richly for enjoyment;— 18to do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to impart, willing to communicate, 19treasuring up to themselves a right foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life age-during. Guard the Faith"
1 Timothy,6,20,"O Timotheus, the thing entrusted guard thou, avoiding the profane vain-words and opposition of the falsely-named knowledge, 21which certain professing—concerning the faith did swerve; the grace is with you. Amen."
2 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, according to a promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, 2to Timotheus, beloved child: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord! Faithfulness under Persecution (Matthew 10:16–25)"
2 Timothy,1,3,"I am thankful to God, whom I serve from progenitors in a pure conscience, that unceasingly I have remembrance concerning thee in my supplications night and day, 4desiring greatly to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that with joy I may be filled, 5taking remembrance of the unfeigned faith that is in thee, that dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that also in thee."
2 Timothy,1,6,"For which cause I remind thee to stir up the gift of God that is in thee through the putting on of my hands, 7for God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind; 8therefore thou mayest not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but do thou suffer evil along with the good news according to the power of God, 9who did save us, and did call with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, that was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the times of the ages, 10and was made manifest now through the manifestation of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who indeed did abolish death, and did enlighten life and immortality through the good news, 11to which I was placed a preacher and an apostle, and a teacher of nations, 12for which cause also these things I suffer, but I am not ashamed, for I have known in whom I have believed, and have been persuaded that he is able that which I have committed to him to guard—to that day. Holding to Sound Teaching"
2 Timothy,1,13,"The pattern hold thou of sound words, which from me thou didst hear, in faith and love that is in Christ Jesus; 14the good thing committed guard thou through the Holy Spirit that is dwelling in us; 15thou hast known this, that they did turn from me—all those in Asia, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes; 16may the Lord give kindness to the house of Onesiphorus, because many times he did refresh me, and of my chain was not ashamed, 17but being in Rome, very diligently he sought me, and found; 18may the Lord give to him to find kindness from the Lord in that day; and how many things in Ephesus he did minister thou dost very well know."
2 Timothy,2,1,"Thou, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, 2and the things that thou didst hear from me through many witnesses, these things be committing to stedfast men, who shall be sufficient also others to teach; 3thou, therefore, suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus Christ; 4no one serving as a soldier did entangle himself with the affairs of life, that him who did enlist him he may please; 5and if also any one may strive, he is not crowned, except he may strive lawfully; 6the labouring husbandman it behoveth first of the fruits to partake; 7be considering what things I say, for the Lord give to thee understanding in all things."
2 Timothy,2,8,"Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news, 9in which I suffer evil—unto bonds, as an evil-doer, but the word of God hath not been bound; 10because of this all things do I endure, because of the choice ones, that they also salvation may obtain that is in Christ Jesus, with glory age-during."
2 Timothy,2,11,"Stedfast is the word: For if we died together—we also shall live together; 12if we do endure together—we shall also reign together; if we deny him, he also shall deny us; 13if we are not stedfast, he remaineth stedfast; to deny himself he is not able. The Lord’s Approved Workman"
2 Timothy,2,14,"These things remind them of, testifying fully before the Lord—not to strive about words to nothing profitable, but to the subversion of those hearing; 15be diligent to present thyself approved to God—a workman irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of the truth; 16and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from, for to more impiety they will advance, 17and their word as a gangrene will have pasture, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus, 18who concerning the truth did swerve, saying the rising again to have already been, and do overthrow the faith of some; 19sure, nevertheless, hath the foundation of God stood, having this seal, ‘The Lord hath known those who are His,’ and ‘Let him depart from unrighteousness—every one who is naming the name of Christ.’"
2 Timothy,2,20,"And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour: 21if, then, any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified and profitable to the master—to every good work having been prepared, 22and the youthful lusts flee thou, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart; 23and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding, having known that they beget strife, 24and a servant of the Lord it behoveth not to strive, but to be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil, 25in meekness instructing those opposing—if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth, 26and they may awake out of the devil’s snare, having been caught by him at his will."
2 Timothy,3,1,"And this know thou, that in the last days there shall come perilous times, 2for men shall be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, evil-speakers, to parents disobedient, unthankful, unkind, 3without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, not lovers of those who are good, 4traitors, heady, lofty, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, 5having a form of piety, and its power having denied; and from these be turning away, 6for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women, laden with sins, led away with desires manifold, 7always learning, and never to a knowledge of truth able to come, 8and, even as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so also these do stand against the truth, men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith; 9but they shall not advance any further, for their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also did become. All Scripture Is God-Breathed (Hebrews 4:12–16)"
2 Timothy,3,10,"And thou—thou hast followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance, 11the persecutions, the afflictions, that befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all the Lord did deliver me, 12and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted, 13and evil men and impostors shall advance to the worse, leading"
2 Timothy,3,14,"And thou—be remaining in the things which thou didst learn and wast entrusted with, having known from whom thou didst learn, 15and because from a babe the Holy Writings thou hast known, which are able to make thee wise—to salvation, through faith that is in Christ Jesus; 16every Writing is God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for setting aright, for instruction that is in righteousness, 17that the man of God may be fitted—for every good work having been completed."
2 Timothy,4,1,"I do fully testify, then, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is about to judge living and dead at his manifestation and his reign— 2preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season, convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching, 3for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they will not suffer, but according to their own desires to themselves they shall heap up teachers— itching in the hearing, 4and indeed, from the truth the hearing they shall turn away, and to the fables"
2 Timothy,4,5,"And thou—watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of one proclaiming good news; of thy ministration make full assurance, 6for I am already being poured out, and the time of my release hath arrived; 7the good strife I have striven, the course I have finished, the faith I have kept, 8henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the righteousness that the Lord—the Righteous Judge—shall give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all those loving his manifestation. Personal Concerns"
2 Timothy,4,9,"Be diligent to come unto me quickly, 10for Demas forsook me, having loved the present age, and went"
2 Timothy,4,11,"Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken, bring with thyself, for he is profitable to me for ministration; 12and Tychicus I sent to Ephesus; 13the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring thou and the books—especially the"
2 Timothy,4,14,"Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; may the Lord repay to him according to his works, 15of whom also do thou beware, for greatly hath he stood against our words; The Lord Remains Faithful 16in my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook me, (may it not be reckoned to them!) 17and the Lord stood by me, and did strengthen me, that through me the preaching might be fully assured, and all the nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion, 18and the Lord shall free me from every evil work, and shall save me—to his heavenly kingdom; to whom is the glory to the ages of the ages! Amen. Final Greetings (Ephesians 6:21–24; Philippians 4:21–23)"
2 Timothy,4,19,"Salute Prisca and Aquilas, and Onesiphorus’ household;"
2 Timothy,4,20,"Erastus did remain in Corinth, and Trophimus I left in Miletus infirm; 21be diligent to come before winter. Salute thee doth Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren."

Titus,1,1,"Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that is according to piety, 2upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie, did promise before times of ages, 3(and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour, 4to Titus—true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour! Appointing Elders on Crete (1 Timothy 3:1–7; 1 Peter 5:1–4)"
Titus,1,5,"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to thee; 6if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate— 7for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre; 8but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled, 9holding—according to the teaching—to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict; Correcting False Teachers (1 Timothy 1:3–11) 10for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers—especially they of the circumcision— 11whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what"
Titus,1,12,"A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said— ‘Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!’ 13this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 14not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth; 15all things, indeed, are pure to the pure, and to the defiled"
Titus,1,16,"God they profess to know, and in the works they deny Him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved."
Titus,2,1,"And thou—be speaking what doth become the sound teaching; 2aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance; 3aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers, 4that they may make the young women sober- minded, to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children, 5sober, pure, keepers of their own houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of."
Titus,2,6,"The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded; 7concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility, 8discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you."
Titus,2,9,"Servants—to their own masters are to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying, 10not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things. God’s Grace Brings Salvation"
Titus,2,11,"For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men, 12teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age, 13waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, 14who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works; 15these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!"
Titus,3,1,"Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready, 2of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome—gentle, showing all meekness to all men, 3for we were once—also we—thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious—hating one another; 4and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear 5(not by works that are in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit, 6which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour, 7that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during."
Titus,3,8,"Stedfast is the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works—who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men, Avoid Divisions (Romans 16:17–20) 9and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from—"

Hebrews,1,1,"In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to the fathers in the prophets, 2in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the ages; 3who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying of his might—through himself having made a cleansing of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the highest, 4having become so much better than the messengers, as he did inherit a more excellent name than they."
Hebrews,1,5,"For to which of the messengers said He ever, ‘My Son thou art—I to-day have begotten thee?’ and again, ‘I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?’ 6and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world, He saith, ‘And let them bow before him— all messengers of God;’ 7and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, ‘Who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;’ 8and unto the Son: ‘Thy throne, O God, is to the age of the age; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy reign; 9thou didst love righteousness, and didst hate lawlessness; because of this did He anoint thee—God, thy God—with oil of gladness above thy partners;’ 10and, ‘Thou, at the beginning, Lord, the earth didst found, and a work of thy hands are the heavens; 11these shall perish, and Thou dost remain, and all, as a garment, shall become old, 12and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.’"
Hebrews,1,13,"And unto which of the messengers said He ever, ‘Sit at My right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?’ 14are they not all spirits of service—for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?"
Hebrews,2,1,"Because of this it behoveth us more abundantly to take heed to the things heard, lest we may glide aside, 2for if the word being spoken through messengers did become stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience did receive a just recompense, 3how shall we escape, having neglected so great salvation? which a beginning receiving—to be spoken through the Lord—by those having heard was"
Hebrews,2,4,"God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders, and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to His will. Jesus like His Brothers"
Hebrews,2,5,"For not to messengers did He subject the coming world, concerning which we speak, 6and one in a certain place did testify fully, saying, ‘What is man, that Thou art mindful of him, or a son of man, that Thou dost look after him?"
Hebrews,2,7,"Thou didst make him some little less than messengers, with glory and honour Thou didst crown him, and didst set him over the works of Thy hands, 8all things Thou didst put in subjection under his feet,’ for in the subjecting to him the all things, nothing did He leave to him unsubjected, and now not yet do we see the all things subjected to him, 9and him who was made some little less than messengers we see—Jesus—because of the suffering of the death, with glory and honour having been crowned, that by the grace of God for every one he might taste of death."
Hebrews,2,10,"For it was becoming to Him, because of whom are the all things, and through whom are the all things, many sons to glory bringing, the author of their salvation through sufferings to make perfect, 11for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified are all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 12saying, ‘I will declare Thy name to my brethren, in the midst of an assembly I will sing praise to Thee;’ and again, ‘I will be trusting on Him;’ 13and again, ‘Behold I and the children that God did give to me.’"
Hebrews,2,14,"Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the same, that through death he might destroy him having the power of death—that is, the devil— 15and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death, throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage, 16for, doubtless, of messengers it doth not lay hold, but of seed of Abraham it layeth hold, 17wherefore it did behove him in all things to be made like to the brethren, that he might become a kind and stedfast chief-priest in the things with God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people, 18for in that he suffered, himself being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted."
Hebrews,3,1,"Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus, 2being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house, 3for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth build it, 4for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build is God, 5and Moses indeed was stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken, 6and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast. Do Not Harden Your Hearts (Psalm 95:1–11)"
Hebrews,3,7,"Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, ‘To-day, if His voice ye may hear— 8ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness, 9in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years; 10wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My ways; 11so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest—!’) The Peril of Unbelief"
Hebrews,3,12,"See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God, 13but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin, 14for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast, 15in its being said, ‘To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,’ 16for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses; 17but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? 18and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe?— 19and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief."
Hebrews,4,1,"We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short, 2for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard, 3for we do enter into the rest—we who did believe, as He said, ‘So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest—;’ and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world, 4for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh day thus: ‘And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;’ 5and in this place again, ‘If they shall enter into My rest—;’ 6since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief— 7again He doth limit a certain day, ‘To-day,’ (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, ‘To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,’ 8for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things; 9there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God, 10for he who did enter into his"
Hebrews,4,11,"May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall, The Living Word (2 Timothy 3:10–17) 12for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart; 13and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and open to His eyes—with whom is our reckoning."
Hebrews,4,14,"Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens—Jesus the Son of God—may we hold fast the profession, 15for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with our infirmities, but one tempted in all things in like manner—apart from sin; 16we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace—for seasonable help."
Hebrews,5,1,"For every chief priest—out of men taken—in behalf of men is set in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins, 2able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray, since himself also is compassed with infirmity; 3and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins; 4and no one to himself doth take the honour, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron: 5so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest, but He who spake unto him: ‘My Son thou art, I to-day have begotten thee;’ 6as also in another place He saith, ‘Thou art a priest—to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;’ 7who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications unto Him who was able to save him from death—with strong crying and tears—having offered up, and having been heard in respect to that which he feared, 8through being a Son, did learn by the things which he suffered—the obedience, 9and having been made perfect, he did become to all those obeying him a cause of salvation age-during, 10having been addressed by God a chief priest, according to the order of Melchisedek, Milk and Solid Food (1 Corinthians 3:1–9) 11concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard explanation to say, since ye have become dull of hearing, 12for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again ye have need that one teach you what are the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and ye have become having need of milk, and not of strong food, 13for every one who is partaking of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness—for he is an infant, 14and of perfect men is the strong food, who because of the use are having the senses exercised, unto the discernment both of good and of evil."
Hebrews,6,1,"Wherefore, having left the word of the beginning of the Christ, unto the perfection we may advance, not again a foundation laying of reformation from dead works, and of faith on God, 2of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on also of hands, of rising again also of the dead, and of judgment age-during, 3and this we will do, if God may permit, 4for it is impossible for those once enlightened, having tasted also of the heavenly gift, and partakers having became of the Holy Spirit, 5and did taste the good saying of God, the powers also of the coming age, 6and having fallen away, again to renew them to"
Hebrews,6,7,"For earth, that is drinking in the rain many times coming upon it, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of whom also it is dressed, doth partake of blessing from God, 8and that which is bearing thorns and briers is disapproved of, and nigh to cursing, whose end is for burning; 9and we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things that are better, and accompanying salvation, though even thus we speak, 10for God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the labour of the love, that ye shewed to His name, having ministered to the saints and ministering; 11and we desire each one of you the same diligence to shew, unto the full assurance of the hope unto the end, 12that ye may not become slothful, but followers of those who through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the promises. God’s Unchangeable Promise"
Hebrews,6,13,"For to Abraham God, having made promise, seeing He was able to swear by no greater, did swear by Himself, 14saying, ‘Blessing indeed I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;’ 15and so, having patiently endured, he did obtain the promise; 16for men indeed do swear by the greater, and an end of all controversy to them for confirmation is the oath, 17in which God, more abundantly willing to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, did interpose by an oath, 18that through two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, a strong comfort we may have who did flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us, 19which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and entering into that within the vail, 20whither a forerunner for us did enter—Jesus, after the order of Melchisedek chief priest having become—to the age."
Hebrews,7,1,"For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him, 2to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, ‘King of righteousness,’ and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,) 3without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually."
Hebrews,7,4,"And see how great this one is, to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils, 5and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham; 6and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath blessed, 7and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed— 8and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there he, who is testified to that he was living, 9and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, hath paid tithes, 10for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him. A Superior Priesthood"
Hebrews,7,11,"If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood—for the people under it had received law—what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron? 12for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change doth come, 13for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar, 14for it is evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord,"
Hebrews,7,15,"And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest, 16who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life, 17for He doth testify—‘Thou art a priest—to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;’ 18for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness, 19(for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope, through"
Hebrews,7,20,"And inasmuch as it is not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests, 21and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him, ‘The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a priest—to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;’) 22by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety, 23and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining; 24and he, because of his remaining—to the age, hath the priesthood not transient, 25whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God—ever living to make intercession for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"For such a chief priest did become us—kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens, 27who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself; 28for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that is after the law appointeth the Son—to the age having been perfected."
Hebrews,8,1,"And the sum concerning the things spoken of is: we have such a chief priest, who did sit down at the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens, 2of the holy places a servant, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord did set up, and not man, 3for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is appointed, whence it is necessary for this one to have also something that he may offer; 4for if, indeed, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest—(there being the priests who are offering according to the law, the gifts, 5who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly things, as Moses hath been divinely warned, being about to construct the tabernacle, for ‘See (saith He) thou mayest make all things according to the pattern that was shewn to thee in the mount;’)— The New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:26–40) 6and now he hath obtained a more excellent service, how much also of a better covenant is he mediator, which on better promises hath been sanctioned, 7for if that first were faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second."
Hebrews,8,8,"For finding fault, He saith to them, ‘Lo, days come, saith the Lord, and I will complete with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, a new covenant, 9not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day of My taking them by their hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt—because they did not remain in My covenant, and I did not regard them, saith the Lord,— 10because this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws into their mind, and upon their hearts I will write them, and I will be to them for a God, and they shall be to Me for a people; 11and they shall not teach each his neighbour, and each his brother, saying, Know thou the Lord, because they shall all know Me from the small one of them unto the great one of them, 12because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will remember no more;’— 13in the saying ‘new,’ He hath made the first old, and what doth become obsolete and is old is nigh disappearing."
Hebrews,9,1,"It had, indeed, then (even the first tabernacle) ordinances of service, also a worldly sanctuary, 2for a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which was both the lamp-stand, and the table, and the bread of the presence—which is called ‘Holy;’ 3and after the second vail a tabernacle that is called ‘Holy of holies,’ 4having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid all round about with gold, in which is the golden pot having the manna, and the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tables of the covenant, 5and over it cherubim of the glory, overshadowing the mercy-seat, concerning which we are not now to speak particularly."
Hebrews,9,6,"And these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle, indeed, at all times the priests do go in, performing the services, 7and into the second, once in the year, only the chief priest, not apart from blood, which he doth offer for himself and the errors of the people, 8the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet hath been manifested the way of the holy places, the first tabernacle having yet a standing; 9which is a simile in regard to the present time, in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are not able, in regard to conscience, to make perfect him who is serving, 10only in victuals, and drinks, and different baptisms, and fleshly ordinances—till the time of reformation imposed upon them. Redemption through His Blood"
Hebrews,9,11,"And Christ being come, chief priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands—that is, not of this creation— 12neither through blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, did enter in once into the holy places, age-during redemption having obtained; 13for if the blood of bulls, and goats, and ashes of an heifer, sprinkling those defiled, doth sanctify to the purifying of the flesh, 14how much more shall the blood of the Christ (who through the age-during Spirit did offer himself unblemished to God) purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
Hebrews,9,15,"And because of this, of a new covenant he is mediator, that, death having come, for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those called may receive the promise of the age-during inheritance, 16for where a covenant is, the death of the covenant-victim to come in is necessary, 17for a covenant over dead victims is stedfast, since it is no force at all when the covenant-victim liveth, 18whence not even the first apart from blood hath been initiated, 19for every command having been spoken, according to law, by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of the calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he both the book itself and all the people did sprinkle, 20saying, ‘This is the blood of the covenant that God enjoined unto you,’ 21and both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service with blood in like manner he did sprinkle, 22and with blood almost all things are purified according to the law, and apart from blood-shedding forgiveness doth not come."
Hebrews,9,23,"It is necessary, therefore, the pattern indeed of the things in the heavens to be purified with these, and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these; 24for not into holy places made with hands did the Christ enter—figures of the true—but into the heaven itself, now to be manifested in the presence of God for us; 25nor that he may many times offer himself, even as the chief priest doth enter into the holy places every year with blood of others; 26since it had behoved him many times to suffer from the foundation of the world, but now once, at the full end of the ages, for putting away of sin through his sacrifice, he hath been manifested; 27and as it is laid up to men once to die, and after this—judgment, 28so also the Christ, once having been offered to bear the sins of many, a second time, apart from a sin-offering, shall appear, to those waiting for him—to salvation!"
Hebrews,10,1,"For the law having a shadow of the coming good things—not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make perfect those coming near, 2since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once been purified? 3but in those sacrifices is a remembrance of sins every year, 4for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins."
Hebrews,10,5,"Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, ‘Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not will, and a body Thou didst prepare for me, 6in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, Thou didst not delight, 7then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it hath been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Thy will;’ 8saying above—‘Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offering Thou didst not will, nor delight in,’—which according to the law are offered— 9then he said, ‘Lo, I come to do, O God, Thy will;’ he doth take away the first that the second he may establish; 10in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once, 11and every priest, indeed, hath stood daily serving, and the same sacrifices many times offering, that"
Hebrews,10,12,"And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered—to the end, did sit down on the right hand of God,— 13as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies as his footstool, 14for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those sanctified; 15and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit, for after that He hath said before,"
Hebrews,10,16,"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and upon their minds I will write them,’ 17and ‘their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more;’ 18and where forgiveness of these is, there is no more offering for sin. A Call to Persevere (Jude 1:17–23)"
Hebrews,10,19,"Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus, 20which way he did initiate for us—new and living, through the vail, that is, his flesh— 21and a high priest over the house of God, 22may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water; 23may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope, (for faithful is He who did promise), 24and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works, 25not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a custom of certain is, but exhorting, and so much the more as ye see the day coming nigh."
Hebrews,10,26,"For we—wilfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth—no more for sins doth there remain a sacrifice, 27but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers; 28any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from mercies, by two or three witnesses, doth die, 29of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified, and to the Spirit of the grace did despite? 30for we have known Him who is saying, ‘Vengeance is Mine, I will recompense, saith the Lord;’ and again, ‘The Lord shall judge His people;’— 31fearful is the falling into the hands of a living God."
Hebrews,10,32,"And call to your remembrance the former days, in which, having been enlightened, ye did endure much conflict of sufferings, 33partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so living, 34for also with my bonds ye sympathised, and the robbery of your goods with joy ye did receive, knowing that ye have in yourselves a better substance"
Hebrews,10,35,"Ye may not cast away, then, your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward, 36for of patience ye have need, that the will of God having done, ye may receive the promise, 37for yet a very very little, He who is coming will come, and will not tarry; 38and ‘the righteous by faith shall live,’ and ‘if he may draw back, My soul hath no pleasure in him,’ 39and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but of those believing to a preserving of soul."
Hebrews,11,1,"And faith is of things hoped for a confidence, of matters not seen a conviction, 2for in this were the elders testified of; 3by faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by a saying of God, in regard to the things seen not having come out of things appearing; The Faith of Abel, Enoch, Noah (Genesis 4–9) 4by faith a better sacrifice did Abel offer to God than Cain, through which he was testified to be"
Hebrews,11,5,"By faith Enoch was translated—not to see death, and was not found, because God did translate him; for before his translation he had been testified to—that he had pleased God well, 6and apart from faith it is impossible to please well, for it behoveth him who is coming to God to believe that He is, and to those seeking"
Hebrews,11,7,"By faith Noah, having been divinely warned concerning the things not yet seen, having feared, did prepare an ark to the salvation of his house, through which he did condemn the world, and of the righteousness according to faith he became heir. The Faith of Abraham and Sarah (Genesis 15–22; Romans 4:1–12)"
Hebrews,11,8,"By faith Abraham, being called, did obey, to go forth to the place that he was about to receive for an inheritance, and he went forth, not knowing whither he doth go; 9by faith he did sojourn in the land of the promise as a strange country, in tabernacles having dwelt with Isaac and Jacob, fellow-heirs of the same promise, 10for he was looking for the city having the foundations, whose artificer and"
Hebrews,11,11,"By faith also Sarah herself did receive power to conceive seed, and she bare after the time of life, seeing she did judge Him faithful who did promise; 12wherefore, also from one were begotten—and that of one who had become dead—as the stars of the heaven in multitude, and as sand that is by the sea-shore—the innumerable."
Hebrews,11,13,"In faith died all these, not having received the promises, but from afar having seen them, and having been persuaded, and having saluted them, and having confessed that strangers and sojourners they are upon the earth, 14for those saying such things make manifest that they seek a country; 15and if, indeed, they had been mindful of that from which they came forth, they might have had an opportunity to return, 16but now they long for a better, that is, an heavenly, wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for He did prepare for them a city."
Hebrews,11,17,"By faith Abraham hath offered up Isaac, being tried, and the only begotten he did offer up who did receive the promises, 18of whom it was said—‘In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee;’ 19reckoning that even out of the dead God is able to raise up, whence also in a figure he did receive him. The Faith of Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph (Genesis 27–50)"
Hebrews,11,20,"By faith, concerning coming things, Isaac did bless Jacob and Esau; 21by faith Jacob dying—each of the sons of Joseph did bless, and did bow down upon the top of his staff; 22by faith, Joseph dying, concerning the outgoing of the sons of Israel did make mention, and concerning his bones did give command. The Faith of Moses (Exodus 2–15; Acts 7:20–22)"
Hebrews,11,23,"By faith Moses, having been born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child comely, and were not afraid of the decree of the king; 24by faith Moses, having become great, did refuse to be called a son of the daughter of Pharaoh, 25having chosen rather to be afflicted with the people of God, than to have sin’s pleasure for a season, 26greater wealth having reckoned the reproach of the Christ than the treasures in Egypt, for he did look to the recompense of reward; 27by faith he left Egypt behind, not having been afraid of the wrath of the king, for, as seeing the Invisible One—he endured; 28by faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that He who is destroying"
Hebrews,11,29,"By faith they did pass through the Red Sea as through dry land, which the Egyptians having received a trial of, were swallowed up; The Faith of Many (Joshua–Malachi) 30by faith the walls of Jericho did fall, having been surrounded for seven days; 31by faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who disbelieved, having received the spies with peace."
Hebrews,11,32,"And what shall I yet say? for the time will fail me recounting about Gideon, Barak also, and Samson, and Jephthah, David also, and Samuel, and the prophets, 33who through faith did subdue kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouth of the sword, were made powerful out of infirmities, became strong in battle,"
Hebrews,11,35,"Women received by a rising again their dead, and others were tortured, not accepting the redemption, that a better rising again they might receive, 36and others of mockings and scourgings did receive trial, and yet of bonds and imprisonment; 37they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tried; in the killing of the sword they died; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins—being destitute, afflicted, injuriously treated, 38of whom the world was not worthy; in deserts wandering, and in mountains, and in caves, and in the holes of the earth;"
Hebrews,11,40,"God for us something better having provided, that apart from us they might not be made perfect."
Hebrews,12,1,"Therefore, we also having so great a cloud of witnesses set around us, every weight having put off, and the closely besetting sin, through endurance may we run the contest that is set before us, 2looking to the author and perfecter of faith—Jesus, who, over-against the joy set before him—did endure a cross, shame having despised, on the right hand also of the throne of God did sit down; 3for consider again him who endured such gainsaying from the sinners to himself, that ye may not be wearied in your souls—being faint. God Disciplines His Sons"
Hebrews,12,4,"Not yet unto blood did ye resist—with the sin striving; 5and ye have forgotten the exhortation that doth speak fully with you as with sons, ‘My son, be not despising chastening of the Lord, nor be faint, being reproved by Him, 6for whom the Lord doth love He doth chasten, and He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;’ 7if chastening ye endure, as to sons God beareth Himself to you, for who is a son whom a father doth not chasten? 8and if ye are apart from chastening, of which all have become partakers, then bastards"
Hebrews,12,9,"Then, indeed, fathers of our flesh we have had, chastising us, and we were reverencing them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of the spirits, and live? 10for they, indeed, for a few days, according to what seemed good to them, were chastening, but He for profit, to be partakers of His separation; 11and all chastening for the present, indeed, doth not seem to be of joy, but of sorrow, yet afterward the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those exercised through it—it doth yield."
Hebrews,12,12,"Wherefore, the hanging-down hands and the loosened knees set ye up; 13and straight paths make for your feet, that that which is lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed; A Call to Holiness (1 Peter 1:13–21) 14peace pursue with all, and the separation, apart from which no one shall see the Lord, 15looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may give trouble, and through this many may be defiled; 16lest any one be a fornicator, or a profane person, as Esau, who in exchange for one morsel of food did sell his birthright, 17for ye know that also afterwards, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was disapproved of, for a place of reformation he found not, though with tears having sought it. An Unshakable Kingdom (Exodus 20:18–21; Deuteronomy 5:22–33)"
Hebrews,12,18,"For ye came not near to the mount touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest, 19and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of sayings, which those having heard did entreat that a word might not be added to them, 20for they were not bearing that which is commanded, ‘And if a beast may touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or with an arrow shot through,’ 21and, (so terrible"
Hebrews,12,22,"But, ye came to Mount Zion, and to a city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of messengers, 23to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven enrolled, and to God the judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men made perfect, 24and to a mediator of a new covenant—Jesus, and to blood of sprinkling, speaking better things than that of Abel!"
Hebrews,12,25,"See, may ye not refuse him who is speaking, for if those did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely speaking—much less we who do turn away from him who speaketh from heaven, 26whose voice the earth shook then, and now hath he promised, saying, ‘Yet once—I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven;’ 27and this—‘Yet once’—doth make evident the removal of the things shaken, as of things having been made, that the things not shaken may remain; 28wherefore, a kingdom that cannot be shaken receiving, may we have grace, through which we may serve God well- pleasingly, with reverence and religious fear; 29for also our God is a consuming fire."
Hebrews,13,1,"Let brotherly love remain; 2of the hospitality be not forgetful, for through this unawares certain did entertain messengers; 3be mindful of those in bonds, as having been bound with them, of those maltreated, as also yourselves being in the body; 4honourable is the marriage in all, and the bed undefiled, and whoremongers and adulterers God shall judge. Christ’s Unchanging Nature"
Hebrews,13,5,"Without covetousness the behaviour, being content with the things present, for He hath said, ‘No, I will not leave, no, nor forsake thee,’ 6so that we do boldly say, ‘The Lord is to me a helper, and I will not fear what man shall do to me.’"

Hebrews,13,8,"Jesus Christ yesterday and to-day the same, and to the ages; 9with teachings manifold and strange be not carried about, for it is good that by grace the heart be confirmed, not with meats, in which they who were occupied were not profited; 10we have an altar, of which to eat they have no authority who the tabernacle are serving, 11for of those beasts whose blood is brought for sin into the holy places through the chief priest—of these the bodies are burned without"
Hebrews,13,12,"Wherefore, also Jesus—that he might sanctify through his own blood the people—without the gate did suffer; 13now, then, may we go forth unto him without the camp, his reproach bearing; 14for we have not here an abiding city, but the coming one we seek; Sacrifice, Obedience, and Prayer 15through him, then, we may offer up a sacrifice of praise always to God, that is, the fruit of lips, giving thanks to His name; 16and of doing good, and of fellowship, be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is well-pleased."
Hebrews,13,17,"Be obedient to those leading you, and be subject, for these do watch for your souls, as about to give account, that with joy they may do this, and not sighing, for this is unprofitable to you."
Hebrews,13,18,"Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good conscience, in all things willing to behave well, 19and more abundantly do I call upon you to do this, that more quickly I may be restored to you. Benediction and Farewell"
Hebrews,13,20,"And the God of the peace, who did bring up out of the dead the great shepherd of the sheep—in the blood of an age-during covenant—our Lord Jesus, 21make you perfect in every good work to do His will, doing in you that which is well-pleasing before Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory— to the ages of the ages! Amen."
Hebrews,13,22,"And I entreat you, brethren, suffer the word of the exhortation, for also through few words I have"
Hebrews,13,23,"Know ye that the brother Timotheus is released, with whom, if he may come more"
Hebrews,13,24,"Salute all those leading you, and all the saints; salute you doth those from Italy: 25the grace is with you all! Amen."
James,1,1,"James, of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ a servant, to the Twelve Tribes who are in the dispersion: Hail! Rejoicing in Trials (Philippians 1:12–20)"
James,1,2,"All joy count it, my brethren, when ye may fall into temptations manifold; 3knowing that the proof of your faith doth work endurance, 4and let the endurance have a perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire—in nothing lacking; 5and if any of you do lack wisdom, let him ask from God, who is giving to all liberally, and not reproaching, and it shall be given to him; 6and let him ask in faith, nothing doubting, for he who is doubting hath been like a wave of the sea, driven by wind and tossed, 7for let not that man suppose that he shall receive anything from the Lord— 8a two-souled man is unstable in all his ways."
James,1,9,"And let the brother who is low rejoice in his exaltation, 10and the rich in his becoming low, because as a flower of grass he shall pass away; 11for the sun did rise with the burning heat, and did wither the grass, and the flower of it fell, and the grace of its appearance did perish, so also the rich in his way shall fade away!"
James,1,12,"Happy the man who doth endure temptation, because, becoming approved, he shall receive the crown of the life, which the Lord did promise to those loving Him. Good and Perfect Gifts"
James,1,13,"Let no one say, being tempted—‘From God I am tempted,’ for God is not tempted of evil, and Himself doth tempt no one, 14and each one is tempted, by his own desires being led away and enticed, 15afterward the desire having conceived, doth give birth to sin, and the sin having been perfected,"
James,1,16,"Be not led astray, my brethren beloved; 17every good giving, and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom is no variation, or shadow of turning; 18having counselled, He did beget us with a word of truth, for our being a certain first-fruit of His creatures. Hearing and Doing"
James,1,19,"So then, my brethren beloved, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, 20for the wrath of a man the righteousness of God doth not work; 21wherefore having put aside all filthiness and superabundance of evil, in meekness be receiving the engrafted word, that is able to save your souls; 22and become ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves, 23because, if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this one hath been like to a man viewing his natural face in a mirror, 24for he did view himself, and hath gone away, and immediately he did forget of what kind he was; 25and he who did look into the perfect law—that of liberty, and did continue there, this one—not a forgetful hearer becoming, but a doer of work—this one shall be happy in his doing."
James,1,26,"If any one doth think to be religious among you, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, of this one vain is the religion; 27religion pure and undefiled with the God and Father is this, to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation—unspotted to keep himself from the world."
James,2,1,"My brethren, hold not, in respect of persons, the faith of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, 2for if there may come into your synagogue a man with gold ring, in gay raiment, and there may come in also a poor man in vile raiment, 3and ye may look upon him bearing the gay raiment, and may say to him, ‘Thou—sit thou here well,’ and to the poor man may say, ‘Thou—stand thou there, or, Sit thou here under my footstool,’— 4ye did not judge fully in yourselves, and did become ill-reasoning judges."
James,2,5,"Hearken, my brethren beloved, did not God choose the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the reign that He promised to those loving Him? 6and ye did dishonour the poor one; do not the rich oppress you and themselves draw you to judgment-seats; 7do they not themselves speak evil of the good name that was called upon you?"
James,2,8,"If, indeed, royal law ye complete, according to the Writing, ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,’— ye do well; 9and if ye accept persons, sin ye do work, being convicted by the law as transgressors; 10for whoever the whole law shall keep, and shall stumble in one point, he hath become guilty of all; 11for He who is saying, ‘Thou mayest not commit adultery,’ said also, ‘Thou mayest do no murder;’ and if thou shalt not commit adultery, and shalt commit murder, thou hast become a transgressor of law; 12so speak ye and so do, as about by a law of liberty to be judged, 13for the judgment without kindness is to him not having done kindness, and exult doth kindness over judgment. Faith and Works (Galatians 3:1–9)"
James,2,14,"What is the profit, my brethren, if faith, any one may speak of having, and works he may not have? is that faith able to save him? 15and if a brother or sister may be naked, and may be destitute of the daily food, 16and any one of you may say to them, ‘Depart ye in peace, be warmed, and be filled,’ and may not give to them the things needful for the body, what is the profit? 17so also the faith, if it may not have works, is dead by itself."
James,2,18,"But say may some one, Thou hast faith, and I have works, shew me thy faith out of thy works, and I will shew thee out of my works my faith: 19thou—thou dost believe that God is one; thou dost well,"
James,2,20,"And dost thou wish to know, O vain man, that the faith"
James,2,21,"Abraham our father—was not he declared righteous out of works, having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar? 22dost thou see that the faith was working with his works, and out of the works the faith was perfected? 23and fulfilled was the Writing that is saying, ‘And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him—to righteousness;’ and, ‘Friend of God’ he was"
James,2,24,"Ye see, then, that out of works is man declared righteous, and not out of faith only; 25and in like manner also Rahab the harlot—was she not out of works declared righteous, having received the messengers, and by another way having sent forth? 26for as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also the faith apart from the works is dead."
James,3,1,"Many teachers become not, my brethren, having known that greater judgment we shall receive, 2for we all make many stumbles; if any one in word doth not stumble, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle also the whole body; 3lo, the bits we put into the mouths of the horses for their obeying us, and their whole body we turn about; 4lo, also the ships, being so great, and by fierce winds being driven, are led about by a very small helm, whithersoever the impulse of the helmsman doth counsel, 5so also the tongue is a little member, and doth boast greatly; lo, a little fire how much wood it doth kindle! 6and the tongue is a fire, the world of the unrighteousness, so the tongue is set in our members, which is spotting our whole body, and is setting on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by the gehenna."
James,3,7,"For every nature, both of beasts and of fowls, both of creeping things and things of the sea, is subdued, and hath been subdued, by the human nature, 8and the tongue no one of men is able to subdue, it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison, 9with it we do bless the God and Father, and with it we do curse the men made according to the similitude of God; 10out of the same mouth doth come forth blessing and cursing; it doth not need, my brethren, these things so to happen; 11doth the fountain out of the same opening pour forth the sweet and the bitter? 12is a fig-tree able, my brethren, olives to make? or a vine figs? so no fountain salt and sweet water is able to make. The Wisdom from Above"
James,3,13,"Who is wise and intelligent among you? let him shew out of the good behaviour his works in meekness of wisdom, 14and if bitter zeal ye have, and rivalry in your heart, glory not, nor lie against the truth; 15this wisdom is not descending from above, but earthly, physical, demon-like, 16for where zeal and rivalry are, there is insurrection and every evil matter; 17and the wisdom from above, first, indeed, is pure, then peaceable, gentle, easily entreated, full of kindness and good fruits, uncontentious, and unhypocritical:— 18and the fruit of the righteousness in peace is sown to those making peace."
James,4,1,"Whence are wars and fightings among you? not thence—out of your passions, that are as soldiers in your members? 2ye desire, and ye have not; ye murder, and are zealous, and are not able to attain; ye fight and war, and ye have not, because of your not asking; 3ye ask, and ye receive not, because"
James,4,4,"Adulterers and adulteresses! have ye not known that friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever, then, may counsel to be a friend of the world,"
James,4,5,"Do ye think that emptily the Writing saith, ‘To envy earnestly desireth the spirit that did dwell in us,’ 6and greater grace he doth give, wherefore he saith, ‘God against proud ones doth set Himself up, and to lowly ones He doth give grace?’ Drawing Near to God 7be subject, then, to God; stand up against the devil, and he will flee from you; 8draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you; cleanse hands, ye sinners! and purify hearts, ye two-souled! 9be exceeding afflicted, and mourn, and weep, let your laughter to mourning be turned, and the joy to heaviness; 10be made low before the Lord, and He shall exalt you."
James,4,11,"Speak not one against another, brethren; he who is speaking against a brother, and is judging his brother, doth speak against law, and doth judge law, and if law thou dost judge, thou art not a doer of law but a judge; 12one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; thou—who art thou that dost judge the other? Do Not Boast about Tomorrow (Proverbs 27:1)"
James,4,13,"Go, now, ye who are saying, ‘To-day and to-morrow we will go on to such a city, and will pass there one year, and traffic, and make gain;’ 14who do not know the thing of the morrow; for what is your life? for it is a vapour that is appearing for a little, and then is vanishing; 15instead of your saying, ‘If the Lord may will, we shall live, and do this or that;’ 16and now ye glory in your pride; all such glorying is evil; 17to him, then, knowing to do good, and not doing, sin it is to him."
James,5,1,"Go, now, ye rich! weep, howling over your miseries that are coming upon you; 2your riches have rotted, and your garments have become moth-eaten; 3your gold and silver have rotted, and the rust of them for a testimony shall be to you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye made treasure in the last days! 4lo, the reward of the workmen, of those who in-gathered your fields, which hath been fraudulently kept back by you—doth cry out, and the exclamations of those who did reap into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth have entered; 5ye did live in luxury upon the earth, and were wanton; ye did nourish your hearts, as in a day of slaughter; 6ye did condemn—ye did murder the righteous one, he doth not resist you. Patience in Suffering (Job 1:1–5)"
James,5,7,"Be patient, then, brethren, till the presence of the Lord; lo, the husbandman doth expect the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it, till he may receive rain—early and latter; 8be patient, ye also; establish your hearts, because the presence of the Lord hath drawn nigh; 9murmur not against one"
James,5,10,"An example take ye of the suffering of evil, my brethren, and of the patience, the prophets who did speak in the name of the Lord; 11lo, we call happy those who are enduring; the endurance of Job ye heard of, and the end of the Lord ye have seen, that very compassionate is the Lord, and pitying."
James,5,12,"And before all things, my brethren, do not swear, neither by the heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath, and let your Yes be Yes, and the No, No; that under judgment ye may not fall. The Prayer of Faith"
James,5,13,"Doth any one suffer evil among you? let him pray; is any of good cheer? let him sing psalms; 14is any infirm among you? let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil, in the name of the Lord, 15and the prayer of the faith shall save the distressed one, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if sins he may have committed, they shall be forgiven to him."
James,5,16,"Be confessing to one another the trespasses, and be praying for one another, that ye may be healed;"
James,5,17,"Elijah was a man like affected as we, and with prayer he did pray—not to rain, and it did not rain upon the land three years and six months; 18and again he did pray, and the heaven did give rain, and the land did bring forth her fruit. Restoring a Sinner"
James,5,19,"Brethren, if any among you may go astray from the truth, and any one may turn him back, 20let him know that he who did turn back a sinner from the straying of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins."
1 Peter,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the choice sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 2according to a foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied! A Living Hope"
1 Peter,1,3,"Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to the abundance of His kindness did beget us again to a living hope, through the rising again of Jesus Christ out of the dead, 4to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and unfading, reserved in the heavens for you, 5who, in the power of God are being guarded, through faith, unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time, 6in which ye are glad, a little now, if it be necessary, being made to sorrow in manifold trials, 7that the proof of your faith—much more precious than of gold that is perishing, and through fire being approved—may be found to praise, and honour, and glory, in the revelation of Jesus Christ, 8whom, not having seen, ye love, in whom, now not seeing and believing, ye are glad with joy unspeakable and glorified, 9receiving the end of your faith—salvation of souls; 10concerning which salvation seek out and search out did prophets who concerning the grace toward you did prophecy, 11searching in regard to what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ that was in them was manifesting, testifying beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory after these, 12to whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they were ministering these, which now were told to you (through those who did proclaim good news to you,) in the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, to which things messengers do desire to bend looking. A Call to Holiness (Hebrews 12:14–17)"
1 Peter,1,13,"Wherefore having girded up the loins of your mind, being sober, hope perfectly upon the grace that is being brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ, 14as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves to the former desires in your ignorance, 15but according as He who did call you is holy, ye also, become holy in all behaviour, 16because it hath been written, ‘Become ye holy, because I am holy;’ 17and if on the Father ye do call, who without acceptance of persons is judging according to the work of each, in fear the time of your sojourn pass ye, 18having known that, not with corruptible things— silver or gold—were ye redeemed from your foolish behaviour delivered by fathers, 19but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and unspotted—Christ’s— 20foreknown, indeed, before the foundation of the world, and manifested in the last times because of you, 21who through him do believe in God, who did raise out of the dead, and glory to him did give, so that your faith and hope may be in God. The Enduring Word (Isaiah 40:6–8)"
1 Peter,1,22,"Your souls having purified in the obedience of the truth through the Spirit to brotherly love unfeigned, out of a pure heart one another love ye earnestly, 23being begotten again, not out of seed corruptible, but incorruptible, through a word of God—living and remaining—to the age; 24because all flesh is as grass, and all glory of man as flower of grass; wither did the grass, and the flower of it fell away, 25and the saying of the Lord doth remain—to the age; and this is the saying that was proclaimed good news to you."
1 Peter,2,1,"Having put aside, then, all evil, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil speakings, 2as new-born babes the word’s pure milk desire ye, that in it ye may grow, 3if so be ye did taste that the Lord is gracious, 4to whom coming—a living stone—by men, indeed, having been disapproved of, but with God choice, precious, 5and ye yourselves, as living stones, are built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,2,6,"Wherefore, also, it is contained in the Writing: ‘Lo, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, choice, precious, and he who is believing on him may not be put to shame;’ 7to you, then, who are believing is the preciousness; and to the unbelieving, a stone that the builders disapproved of, this one did become for the head of a corner, 8and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence—who are stumbling at the word, being unbelieving,— to which also they were set; 9and ye are a choice race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired, that the excellences ye may shew forth of Him who out of darkness did call you to His wondrous light; 10who were once not a people, and are now the people of God; who had not found kindness, and now have found kindness."
1 Peter,2,11,"Beloved, I call upon you, as strangers and sojourners, to keep from the fleshly desires, that war against the soul, 12having your behaviour among the nations right, that in that which they speak against you as evil-doers, of the good works having beheld, they may glorify God in a day of inspection. Submission to Authorities (Romans 13:1–7)"
1 Peter,2,13,"Be subject, then, to every human creation, because of the Lord, whether to a king, as the highest, 14whether to governors, as to those sent through him, for punishment, indeed, of evil-doers, and a praise of those doing good; 15because, so is the will of God, doing good, to put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men; 16as free, and not having the freedom as the cloak of the evil, but as servants of God; 17to all give ye honour; the brotherhood love ye; God fear ye; the king honour ye."
1 Peter,2,18,"The domestics! be subjecting yourselves in all fear to the masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the cross; 19for this is gracious, if because of conscience toward God any one doth endure sorrows, suffering unrighteously; 20for what renown is it, if sinning and being buffeted, ye do endure it? but if, doing good and suffering for it, ye do endure, this is gracious with God, Christ’s Example of Suffering (Isaiah 53:1–8) 21for to this ye were called, because Christ also did suffer for you, leaving to you an example, that ye may follow his steps, 22who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in his mouth, 23who being reviled— was not reviling again, suffering—was not threatening, and was committing himself to Him who is judging righteously, 24who our sins himself did bear in his body, upon the tree, that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may live; by whose stripes ye were healed, 25for ye were as sheep going astray, but ye turned back now to the shepherd and overseer of your souls."
1 Peter,3,1,"In like manner, the wives, be ye subject to your own husbands, that even if certain are disobedient to the word, through the conversation of the wives, without the word, they may be won, 2having beheld your pure behaviour in fear, 3whose adorning—let it not be that which is outward, of plaiting of hair, and of putting around of things of gold, or of putting on of garments, 4but—the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible thing of the meek and quiet spirit, which is, before God, of great price, 5for thus once also the holy women who did hope on God, were adorning themselves, being subject to their own husbands, 6as Sarah was obedient to Abraham, calling him ‘sir,’ of whom ye did become daughters, doing good, and not fearing any terror."
1 Peter,3,7,"The husbands, in like manner, dwelling with them, according to knowledge, as to a weaker vessel— to the wife—imparting honour, as also being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered. Turning from Evil"
1 Peter,3,8,"And finally, being all of one mind, having fellow-feeling, loving as brethren, compassionate, courteous, 9not giving back evil for evil, or railing for railing, and on the contrary, blessing, having known that to this ye were called, that a blessing ye may inherit; 10for ‘he who is willing to love life, and to see good days, let him guard his tongue from evil, and his lips—not to speak guile; 11let him turn aside from evil, and do good, let him seek peace and pursue it; 12because the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears—to their supplication, and the face of the Lord is upon those doing evil;’ 13and who is he who will be doing you evil, if of Him who is good ye may become imitators? Suffering for Righteousness 14but if ye also should suffer because of righteousness, happy are ye! and of their fear be not afraid, nor be troubled, 15and the Lord God sanctify in your hearts. And be ready always for defence to every one who is asking of you an account concerning the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; 16having a good conscience, that in that in which they speak against you as evil-doers, they may be ashamed who are traducing your good behaviour in Christ; 17for it is better doing good, if the will of God will it, to suffer, than doing evil; 18because also Christ once for sin did suffer—righteous for unrighteous—that he might lead us to God, having been put to death indeed, in the flesh, and having been made alive in the spirit, 19in which also to the spirits in prison having gone he did preach, 20who sometime disbelieved, when once the long-suffering of God did wait, in days of Noah—an ark being preparing—in which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water; 21also to which an antitype doth now save us—baptism, (not a putting away of the filth of flesh, but the question of a good conscience in regard to God,) through the rising again of Jesus Christ, 22who is at the right hand of God, having gone on to heaven—messengers, and authorities, and powers, having been subjected to him."
1 Peter,4,1,"Christ, then, having suffered for us in the flesh, ye also with the same mind arm yourselves, because he who did suffer in the flesh hath done with sin, 2no more in the desires of men, but in the will of God, to live the rest of the time in the flesh; 3for sufficient to us is the past time of life the will of the nations to have wrought, having walked in lasciviousnesses, desires, excesses of wines, revellings, drinking-bouts, and unlawful idolatries, 4in which they think it strange—your not running with them to the same excess of dissoluteness, speaking evil, 5who shall give an account to Him who is ready to judge living and dead, 6for for this also to dead men was good news proclaimed, that they may be judged, indeed, according to men in the flesh, and may live according to God in the spirit."
1 Peter,4,7,"And of all things the end hath come nigh; be sober-minded, then, and watch unto the prayers, 8and, before all things, to one another having the earnest love, because the love shall cover a multitude of sins; 9hospitable to one another, without murmuring; 10each, according as he received a gift, to one another ministering it, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God; 11if any one doth speak—‘as oracles of God;’ if any one doth minister—‘as of the ability which God doth supply;’ that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power—to the ages of the ages. Amen. Suffering as Christians"
1 Peter,4,12,"Beloved, think it not strange at the fiery suffering among you that is coming to try you, as if a strange thing were happening to you, 13but, according as ye have fellowship with the sufferings of the Christ, rejoice ye, that also in the revelation of his glory ye may rejoice—exulting; 14if ye be reproached in the name of Christ—happy are ye, because the Spirit of glory and of God upon you doth rest; in regard, indeed, to them, he is evil-spoken of, and in regard to you, he is glorified; 15for let none of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or evil-doer, or as an inspector into other men’s matters; 16and if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; and let him glorify God in this respect; 17because it is the time of the beginning of the judgment from the house of God, and if first from us, what the end of those disobedient to the"
1 Peter,4,18,"And if the righteous man is scarcely saved, the ungodly and sinner—where shall he appear? 19so that also those suffering according to the will of god, as to a stedfast Creator, let them commit their own souls in good doing."
1 Peter,5,1,"Elders who are among you, I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ, and of the glory about to be revealed a partaker, 2feed the flock of God that is among you, overseeing not constrainedly, but willingly, neither for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind, 3neither as exercising lordship over the heritages, but patterns becoming of the flock, 4and at the manifestation of the chief Shepherd, ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory. Cast Your Cares on Him"
1 Peter,5,5,"In like manner, ye younger, be subject to elders, and all to one another subjecting yourselves; with humble-mindedness clothe yourselves, because God the proud doth resist, but to the humble He doth give grace; 6be humbled, then, under the powerful hand of God, that you He may exalt in good time, 7all your"
1 Peter,5,8,"Be sober, vigilant, because your opponent the devil, as a roaring lion, doth walk about, seeking whom he may swallow up, 9whom resist, stedfast in the faith, having known the same sufferings to your brotherhood in the world to be accomplished. Benediction and Farewell"
1 Peter,5,10,"And the God of all grace, who did call you to His age-during glory in Christ Jesus, having suffered a little, Himself make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you; 11to Him is the glory, and the power— to the ages and the ages! Amen."
1 Peter,5,12,"Through Silvanus, to you the faithful brother, as I reckon, through few words I did write, exhorting"
1 Peter,5,13,Salute you doth the assembly
1 Peter,5,14,Salute ye one another in a kiss of love; peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus! Amen.
2 Peter,1,1,"Simeon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who did obtain a like precious faith"
2 Peter,1,2,"Grace to you, and peace be multiplied in the acknowledgement of God and of Jesus our Lord! Partakers of the Divine Nature"
2 Peter,1,3,"As all things to us His divine power (the things pertaining unto life and piety) hath given, through the acknowledgement of him who did call us through glory and worthiness, 4through which to us the most great and precious promises have been given, that through these ye may become partakers of a divine"
2 Peter,1,5,"And this same also—all diligence having brought in besides, superadd in your faith the worthiness, and in the worthiness the knowledge, 6and in the knowledge the temperance, and in the temperance the endurance, and in the endurance the piety, 7and in the piety the brotherly kindness, and in the brotherly kindness the love; 8for these things being to you and abounding, do make you neither inert nor unfruitful in regard to the acknowledging of our Lord Jesus Christ, 9for he with whom these things are not present is blind, dim- sighted, having become forgetful of the cleansing of his old sins; 10wherefore, the rather, brethren, be diligent to make stedfast your calling and choice, for these things doing, ye may never stumble, 11for so, richly shall be superadded to you the entrance into the age-during reign of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
2 Peter,1,12,"Wherefore, I will not be careless always to remind you concerning these things, though, having known them, and having been established in the present truth, 13and I think right, so long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up in reminding you, 14having known that soon is the laying aside of my tabernacle, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ did shew to me, 15and I will be diligent that also at every time ye have, after my outgoing, power to make to yourselves the remembrance of these things. Eyewitnesses of His Majesty (Matthew 17:1–13; Mark 9:1–13; Luke 9:28–36)"
2 Peter,1,16,"For, skilfully devised fables not having followed out, we did make known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but eye-witnesses having become of his majesty— 17for having received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being borne to him by the excellent glory: ‘This is My Son—the beloved, in whom I was well pleased;’ 18and this voice we—we did hear, out of heaven borne, being with him in the holy mount."
2 Peter,1,19,"And we have more firm the prophetic word, to which we do well giving heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, till day may dawn, and a morning star may arise—in your hearts; 20this first knowing, that no prophecy of the Writing doth come of private exposition, 21for not by will of man did ever prophecy come, but by the Holy Spirit borne on holy men of God spake."
2 Peter,2,1,"And there did come also false prophets among the people, as also among you there shall be false teachers, who shall bring in besides destructive sects, and the Master who bought them denying, bringing to themselves quick destruction, 2and many shall follow out their destructive ways, because of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of, 3and in covetousness, with moulded words, of you they shall make merchandise, whose judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction doth not slumber."
2 Peter,2,4,"For if God messengers who sinned did not spare, but with chains of thick gloom, having cast them down to Tartarus, did deliver them to judgment, having been reserved, 5and the old world did not spare, but the eighth person, Noah, of righteousness a preacher, did keep, a flood on the world of the impious having brought, 6and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah having turned to ashes, with an overthrow did condemn, an example to those about to be impious having set them; 7and righteous Lot, worn down by the conduct in lasciviousness of the impious, He did rescue, 8for in seeing and hearing, the righteous man, dwelling among them, day by day the righteous soul with"
2 Peter,2,9,"The Lord hath known to rescue pious ones out of temptation, and unrighteous ones to a day of judgment, being punished, to keep, 10and chiefly those going behind the flesh in desire of uncleanness, and lordship despising; presumptuous, self-complacent, dignities they are not afraid to speak evil of, 11whereas messengers, in strength and power being greater, do not bear against them before the Lord an evil speaking judgment; 12and these, as irrational natural beasts, made to be caught and destroyed—in what things they are ignorant of, speaking evil—in their destruction shall be destroyed, 13about to receive a reward of unrighteousness, pleasures counting the luxury in the day, spots and blemishes, luxuriating in their deceits, feasting with you, 14having eyes full of adultery, and unable to cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having an heart exercised in covetousnesses, children of a curse, 15having forsaken a right way, they did go astray, having followed in the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who a reward of unrighteousness did love, 16and had a rebuke of his own iniquity—a dumb ass, in man’s voice having spoken, did forbid the madness of the prophet."
2 Peter,2,17,"These are wells without water, and clouds by a tempest driven, to whom the thick gloom of the darkness to the age hath been kept; 18for overswellings of vanity speaking, they do entice in desires of the flesh—lasciviousnesses, those who had truly escaped from those conducting themselves in error, 19liberty to them promising, themselves being servants of the corruption, for by whom any one hath been overcome, to this one also he hath been brought to servitude, 20for, if having escaped from the pollutions of the world, in the acknowledging of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and by these again being entangled, they have been overcome, become to them hath the last things worse than the first, 21for it were better to them not to have acknowledged the way of the righteousness, than having acknowledged it, to turn back from the holy command delivered to them, 22and happened to them hath that of the true similitude; ‘A dog did turn back upon his own vomit,’ and, ‘A sow having bathed herself—to rolling in mire.’"
2 Peter,3,1,"This, now, beloved, a second letter to you I write, in both which I stir up your pure mind in reminding you, 2to be mindful of the sayings said before by the holy prophets, and of the command of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour, 3this first knowing, that there shall come in the latter end of the days scoffers, according to their own desires going on, 4and saying, ‘Where is the promise of his presence? for since the fathers did fall asleep, all things so remain from the beginning of the creation;’ 5for this is unobserved by them willingly, that the heavens were of old, and the earth out of water and through water standing together by the word of God, 6through which the then world, by water having been deluged, was destroyed; 7and the present heavens and the earth, by the same word are treasured, for fire being kept to a day of judgment and destruction of the impious men. The Day of the Lord (Zephaniah 1:7–18; Malachi 4:1–6; 1 Thessalonians 5:1–11)"
2 Peter,3,8,"And this one thing let not be unobserved by you, beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day; 9the Lord is not slow in regard to the promise, as certain count slowness, but is long-suffering to us, not counselling any to be lost but all to pass on to reformation, 10and it will come—the day of the Lord—as a thief in the night, in which the heavens with a rushing noise will pass away, and the elements with burning heat be dissolved, and earth and the works in it shall be burnt up."
2 Peter,3,11,"All these, then, being dissolved, what kind of persons doth it behove you to be in holy behaviours and pious acts? 12waiting for and hasting to the presence of the day of God, by which the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements with burning heat shall melt; 13and for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise we do wait, in which righteousness doth dwell; Final Exhortations 14wherefore, beloved, these things waiting for, be diligent, spotless and unblameable, by Him to be found in peace, 15and the long-suffering of our Lord count ye salvation, according as also our beloved brother Paul—according to the wisdom given to him—did write to you, 16as also in all the epistles, speaking in them concerning these things, among which things are certain hard to be understood,"
2 Peter,3,17,"Ye, then, beloved, knowing before, take heed, lest, together with the error of the impious being led away, ye may fall from your own stedfastness, 18and increase ye in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; to him is the glory both now, and to the day of the age! Amen."
1 John,1,1,"That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we did behold, and our hands did handle, concerning the Word of the Life— 2and the Life was manifested, and we have seen, and do testify, and declare to you the Life, the age-during, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us— 3that which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that ye also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ; 4and these things we write to you, that your joy may be full. Walking in the Light (John 8:12–29)"
1 John,1,5,"And this is the message that we have heard from Him, and announce to you, that God is light, and darkness in Him is not at all; 6if we may say—‘we have fellowship with Him,’ and in the darkness may walk—we lie, and do not the truth; 7and if in the light we may walk, as He is in the light—we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son doth cleanse us from every sin; 8if we may say—‘we have not sin,’ ourselves we lead astray, and the truth is not in us; 9if we may confess our sins, stedfast He is and righteous that He may forgive us the sins, and may cleanse us from every unrighteousness; 10if we may say—‘we have not sinned,’ a liar we make Him, and His word is not in us."
1 John,2,1,"My little children, these things I write to you, that ye may not sin: and if any one may sin, an advocate we have with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one, 2and he—he is a propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world, 3and in this we know that we have known him, if his commands we may keep; 4he who is saying, ‘I have known him,’ and his command is not keeping, a liar he is, and in him the truth is not; 5and whoever may keep his word, truly in him the love of God hath been perfected; in this we know that in"
1 John,2,6,"He who is saying in him he doth remain, ought according as he walked also himself so to walk. A New Commandment"
1 John,2,7,"Brethren, a new command I write not to you, but an old command, that ye had from the beginning— the old command is the word that ye heard from the beginning; 8again, a new command I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness doth pass away, and the true light doth now shine; 9he who is saying, in the light he is, and his brother is hating, in the darkness he is till now; 10he who is loving his brother, in the light he doth remain, and a stumbling-block in him there is not; 11and he who is hating his brother, in the darkness he is, and in the darkness he doth walk, and he hath not known whither he doth go, because the darkness did blind his eyes."
1 John,2,12,"I write to you, little children, because the sins have been forgiven you through his name;"
1 John,2,13,"I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him who is from the beginning; I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil. I write to you, little youths, because ye have known the Father:"
1 John,2,14,"I did write to you, fathers, because ye have known him who is from the beginning; I did write to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God in you doth remain, and ye have overcome the evil. Do Not Love the World"
1 John,2,15,"Love not ye the world, nor the things in the world; if any one doth love the world, the love of the Father is not in him, 16because all that is in the world—the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the ostentation of the life—is not of the Father, but of the world, 17and the world doth pass away, and the desire of it, and he who is doing the will of God, he doth remain—to the age. Beware of Antichrists"
1 John,2,18,"Little youths, it is the last hour; and even as ye heard that the antichrist doth come, even now antichrists have become many—whence we know that it is the last hour; 19out of us they went forth, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but—that they"
1 John,2,20,"And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and"
1 John,2,21,"I did not write to you because ye have not known the truth, but because ye"
1 John,2,22,"Who is the liar, except he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? this one is the antichrist who is denying the Father and the Son; 23every one who is denying the Son, neither hath he the Father, he who is confessing the Son hath the Father also. Remain in Christ"
1 John,2,24,"Ye, then, that which ye heard from the beginning, in you let it remain; if in you may remain that which from the beginning ye did hear, ye also in the Son and in the Father shall remain, 25and this is the promise that He did promise us—the life the age-during."
1 John,2,26,"These things I did write to you concerning those leading you astray; 27and you, the anointing that ye did receive from him, in you it doth remain, and ye have no need that any one may teach you, but as the same anointing doth teach you concerning all, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as was taught you, ye shall remain in him."
1 John,2,28,"And now, little children, remain in him, that when he may be manifested, we may have boldness, and may not be ashamed before him, in his presence; 29if ye know that he is righteous, know ye that every one doing the righteousness, of him hath been begotten."
1 John,3,1,"See ye what love the Father hath given to us, that children of God we may be called; because of this the world doth not know us, because it did not know Him; 2beloved, now, children of God are we, and it was not yet manifested what we shall be, and we have known that if he may be manifested, like him we shall be, because we shall see him as he is; 3and every one who is having this hope on him, doth purify himself, even as he is pure."
1 John,3,4,"Every one who is doing the sin, the lawlessness also he doth do, and the sin is the lawlessness, 5and ye have known that he was manifested that our sins he may take away, and sin is not in him; 6every one who is remaining in him doth not sin; every one who is sinning, hath not seen him, nor known"
1 John,3,7,"Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who is doing the righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous, 8he who is doing the sin, of the devil he is, because from the beginning the devil doth sin; for this was the Son of God manifested, that he may break up the works of the devil; 9every one who hath been begotten of God, sin he doth not, because his seed in him doth remain, and he is"
1 John,3,10,"In this manifest are the children of God, and the children of the devil; every one who is not doing righteousness, is not of God, and he who is not loving his brother, Love One Another (John 13:31–35; Romans 12:9–13) 11because this is the message that ye did hear from the beginning, that we may love one another, 12not as Cain—of the evil one he was, and he did slay his brother, and wherefore did he slay him? because his works were evil, and those of his brother righteous."
1 John,3,13,"Do not wonder, my brethren, if the world doth hate you; 14we—we have known that we have passed out of the death to the life, because we love the brethren; he who is not loving the brother doth remain"
1 John,3,15,"Every one who is hating his brother—a man-killer he is, and ye have known that no man-killer hath life age-during in him remaining, 16in this we have known the love, because he for us his life did lay down, and we ought for the brethren the lives to lay down; 17and whoever may have the goods of the world, and may view his brother having need, and may shut up his bowels from him—"
1 John,3,18,"My little children, may we not love in word nor in tongue, but in work and in truth! 19and in this we know that of the truth we are, and before Him we shall assure our hearts, 20because if our heart may condemn—because greater is God than our heart, and"
1 John,3,21,"Beloved, if our heart may not condemn us, we have boldness toward God, 22and whatever we may ask, we receive from Him, because His commands we keep, and the things pleasing before Him we do, 23and this is His command, that we may believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and may love one another, even as He did give command to us, 24and he who is keeping His commands, in Him he doth remain, and He in him; and in this we know that He doth remain in us, from the Spirit that He gave us."
1 John,4,1,"Beloved, every spirit believe not, but prove the spirits, if of God they are, because many false prophets have gone forth to the world; 2in this know ye the Spirit of God; every spirit that doth confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is, 3and every spirit that doth not confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is not; and this is that of the antichrist, which ye heard that it doth come,"
1 John,4,4,"Ye—of God ye are, little children, and ye have overcome them;"
1 John,4,5,"They—of the world they are; because of this from the world they speak, and the world doth hear them; 6we—of God we are; he who is knowing God doth hear us; he who is not of God, doth not hear us; from this we know the spirit of the truth, and the spirit of the error. Love Comes from God"
1 John,4,7,"Beloved, may we love one another, because the love is of God, and every one who is loving, of God he hath been begotten, and doth know God; 8he who is not loving did not know God, because God is"
1 John,4,9,"In this was manifested the love of God in us, because His Son—the only begotten—hath God sent to the world, that we may live through him; 10in this is the love, not that we loved God, but that"
1 John,4,11,"Beloved, if thus did God love us, we"
1 John,4,12,"God no one hath ever seen; if we may love one another, God in us doth remain, and His love is having been perfected in us; 13in this we know that in Him we do remain,"
1 John,4,14,"And we—we have seen and do testify, that the Father hath sent the Son—Saviour of the world; 15whoever may confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God in him doth remain, and he in God; 16and we—we have known and believed the love, that God hath in us; God is love, and he who is remaining"
1 John,4,17,"In this made perfect hath been the love with us, that boldness we may have in the day of the judgment, because even as He is, we—we also are in this world; 18fear is not in the love, but the perfect love doth cast out the fear, because the fear hath punishment, and he who is fearing hath not been made perfect in the love; 19we—we love him, because He—He first loved us; 20if any one may say—‘I love God,’ and his brother he may hate, a liar he is; for he who is not loving his brother whom he hath seen, God—whom he hath not seen—how is he able to love? 21and this is the command we have from Him, that he who is loving God, may also love his brother."
1 John,5,1,"Every one who is believing that Jesus is the Christ, of God he hath been begotten, and every one who is loving Him who did beget, doth love also him who is begotten of Him: 2in this we know that we love the children of God, when we may love God, and His commands may keep; 3for this is the love of God, that His commands we may keep, and His commands are not burdensome; 4because every one who is begotten of God doth overcome the world, and this is the victory that did overcome the world—our faith;"
1 John,5,6,"This one is he who did come through water and blood—Jesus the Christ, not in the water only, but in the water and the blood; and the Spirit it is that is testifying, because the Spirit is the truth, 7because three are who are testifying in the heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these—the three— are one; 8and three are who are testifying in the earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood, and the three are into the one. God’s Testimony about His Son"

1 John,5,10,"He who is believing in the Son of God, hath the testimony in himself; he who is not believing God, a liar hath made Him, because he hath not believed in the testimony that God hath testified concerning His Son; 11and this is the testimony, that life age- during did God give to us, and this—the life—is in His Son; 12he who is having the Son, hath the life; he who is not having the Son of God—the life he hath not. Effective Prayer"
1 John,5,13,"These things I did write to you who are believing in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know"
1 John,5,14,"And this is the boldness that we have toward Him, that if anything we may ask according to his will, He doth hear us, 15and if we have known that He doth hear us, whatever we may ask, we have known that we have the requests that we have requested from Him."
1 John,5,16,"If any one may see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and He shall give to him life to those sinning not unto death; there is sin to death, not concerning it do I speak that he may beseech; 17all unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto death. The True God"
1 John,5,18,"We have known that every one who hath been begotten of God doth not sin, but he who was begotten of God doth keep himself, and the evil one doth not touch him; 19we have known that of God we are, and the whole world in the evil doth lie; 20and we have known that the Son of God is come, and hath given us a mind, that we may know Him who is true, and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ; this one is the true God and the life age-during!"

Walking in the Truth (John 8:30–47)"
2 John,1,4,"I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, even as a command we did receive from the Father; 5and now I beseech thee, Kyria, not as writing to thee a new command, but which we had from the beginning, that we may love one another, 6and this is the love, that we may walk according to His commands; this is the command, even as ye did hear from the beginning, that in it ye may walk, Beware of Deceivers 7because many leading astray did enter into the world, who are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in"
2 John,1,8,"See to yourselves that ye may not lose the things that we wrought, but a full reward may receive; 9every one who is transgressing, and is not remaining in the teaching of the Christ, hath not God; he who is remaining in the teaching of the Christ, this one hath both the Father and the Son; 10if any one doth come unto you, and this teaching doth not bear, receive him not into the house, and say not to him, ‘Hail!’ 11for he who is saying to him, ‘Hail,’ hath fellowship with his evil works. Conclusion (3 John 1:13–14)"

3 John,1,1,"The Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth! 2beloved, concerning all things I desire thee to prosper, and to be in health, even as thy soul doth prosper, 3for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying of the truth in thee, even as thou in truth dost walk; 4greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of my children in truth walking. Gaius Commended for Hospitality"
3 John,1,5,"Beloved, faithfully dost thou do whatever thou mayest work to the brethren and to the strangers, 6who did testify of thy love before an assembly, whom thou wilt do well, having sent forward worthily of God, 7because for His name they went forth, nothing receiving from the nations; 8we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may become to the truth. Diotrephes and Demetrius"
3 John,1,9,"I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first place among them—Diotrephes—doth not receive us; 10because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to remember his works that he doth, with evil words prating against us; and not content with these, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and those intending he doth forbid, and out of the assembly he doth cast."
3 John,1,11,"Beloved, be not thou following that which is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who is doing evil hath not seen God; 12to Demetrius testimony hath been given by all, and by the truth itself, and we also—we do testify, and ye have known that our testimony is true. Conclusion (2 John 1:12–13)"
3 John,1,13,"Many things I had to write, but I do not wish through ink and pen to write to thee, 14and I hope straightway to see thee, and mouth to mouth we shall speak. Peace to thee! salute thee do the friends; be saluting the friends by name."

Jude,1,3,"Beloved, all diligence using to write to you concerning the common salvation, I had necessity to write to you, exhorting to agonize for the faith once delivered to the saints, 4for there did come in unobserved certain men, long ago having been written beforehand to this judgment, impious, the grace of our God perverting to lasciviousness, and our only Master, God, and Lord—Jesus Christ—denying, 5and to remind you I intend, you knowing once this, that the Lord, a people out of the land of Egypt having saved, again those who did not believe did destroy; 6messengers also, those who did not keep their own principality, but did leave their proper dwelling, to a judgment of a great day, in bonds everlasting, under darkness He hath kept, 7as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, in like manner to these, having given themselves to whoredom, and gone after other flesh, have been set before—an example, of fire age-during, justice suffering."
Jude,1,8,"In like manner, nevertheless, those dreaming also the flesh indeed do defile, and lordship they put away, and dignities they speak evil of, 9yet Michael, the chief messenger, when, with the devil contending, he was disputing about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring up an evil-speaking judgment, but said, ‘The Lord rebuke thee!’ 10and these, as many things indeed as they have not known, they speak evil of; and as many things as naturally (as the irrational beasts) they understand, in these they are corrupted; 11woe to them! because in the way of Cain they did go on, and to the"

Jude,1,20,"And ye, beloved, on your most holy faith building yourselves up, in the Holy Spirit praying, 21yourselves in the love of God keep ye, waiting for the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ—to life age-during; 22and to some be kind, judging thoroughly, 23and some in fear save ye, out of the fire snatching, hating even the coat from the flesh spotted.

Amen! and I have the keys of the hades and of the death. 19‘Write the things that thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to come after these things; 20the secret of the seven stars that thou hast seen upon my right hand, and the seven golden lamp-stands: the seven stars are messengers of the seven assemblies, and the seven lamp- stands that thou hast seen are seven assemblies."

The Fifth Seal: The Martyrs"
Revelation,6,9,"And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony that they held, 10and they were crying with a great voice, saying, ‘Till when, O Master, the Holy and the True, dost Thou not judge and take vengeance of our blood from those dwelling upon the land?’ 11and there was given to each one white robes, and it was said to them that they may rest themselves yet a little time, till may be fulfilled also their fellow-servants and their brethren, who are about to be killed—even as they. The Sixth Seal: Terror"
Revelation,6,12,"And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and lo, a great earthquake came, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, 13and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth—as a fig-tree doth cast her winter figs, by a great wind being shaken— 14and heaven departed as a scroll rolled up, and every mountain and island—out of their places they were moved; 15and the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich, and the chiefs of thousands, and the mighty, and every servant, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains, 16and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, ‘Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of Him who is sitting upon the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb,’ 17because come did the great day of His anger, and who is able to stand?"
Revelation,7,1,"And after these things I saw four messengers, standing upon the four corners of the land, holding the four winds of the land, that the wind may not blow upon the land, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree; 2and I saw another messenger going up from the rising of the sun, having a seal of the living God, and he did cry with a great voice to the four messengers, to whom it was given to injure the land and the sea, saying, 3‘Do not injure the land, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we may seal the servants of our God upon their foreheads.’"
Revelation,7,4,"And I heard the number of those sealed, (one hundred and forty four thousands were sealed out of all the tribes of the sons of Israel): 5of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand were sealed; 6of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand were sealed; 7of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand were sealed; 8of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.

Revelation,7,11,"And all the messengers stood around the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell upon their face, and bowed before God, 12saying, ‘Amen! the blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the honour, and the power, and the strength, are to our God—to the ages of the ages! Amen!’"
Revelation,7,13,"And answer did one of the elders, saying to me, ‘These, who have been arrayed with the white robes—who are they, and whence came they?’ 14and I have said to him, ‘Sir, thou hast known;’ and he said to me, ‘These are those who are coming out of the great tribulation, and they did wash their robes, and they made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb; 15because of this are they before the throne of God, and they do service to Him day and night in His sanctuary, and He who is sitting upon the throne shall tabernacle over them; 16they shall not hunger any more, nor may the sun fall upon them, nor any heat, 17because the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters, and wipe away shall God every tear from their eyes.’"
Revelation,8,1,"And when he openeth the seventh seal, there came silence in the heaven about half-an-hour, 2and I saw the seven messengers who before God have stood, and there were given to them seven trumpets, 3and another messenger did come, and he stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and there was given to him much perfume, that he may give it to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar that is before the throne, 4and go up did the smoke of the perfumes to the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the messenger, before God; 5and the messenger took the censer, and did fill it out of the fire of the altar, and did cast it to the earth, and there came voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake. The First Four Trumpets"
Revelation,8,6,"And the seven messengers who are having the seven trumpets did prepare themselves that they may sound; 7and the first messenger did sound, and there came hail and fire, mingled with blood, and it was cast to the land, and the third of the trees was burnt up, and all the green grass was burnt up."
Revelation,8,8,"And the second messenger did sound, and as it were a great mountain with fire burning was cast into the sea, and the third of the sea became blood, 9and die did the third of the creatures that are in the sea, those having life, and the third of the ships were destroyed."
Revelation,8,10,"And the third messenger did sound, and there fell out of the heaven a great star, burning as a lamp, and it did fall upon the third of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters, 11and the name of the star is called Wormwood, and the third of the waters doth become wormwood, and many of the men did die of the waters, because they were made bitter."
Revelation,8,12,"And the fourth messenger did sound, and smitten was the third of the sun, and the third of the moon, and the third of the stars, that darkened may be the third of them, and that the day may not shine—the third of it, and the night in like manner."
Revelation,8,13,"And I saw, and I heard one messenger, flying in the mid-heaven, saying with a great voice, ‘Woe, woe, woe, to those dwelling upon the land from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three messengers who are about to sound.’"
Revelation,9,1,"And the fifth messenger did sound, and I saw a star out of the heaven having fallen to the earth, and there was given to it the key of the pit of the abyss, 2and he did open the pit of the abyss, and there came up a smoke out of the pit as smoke of a great furnace, and darkened was the sun and the air,"
Revelation,9,3,"And out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth, and there was given to them authority, as scorpions of the earth have authority, 4and it was said to them that they may not injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but—the men only who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads, 5and it was given to them that they may not kill them, but that they may be tormented five months, and their torment is as the torment of a scorpion, when it may strike a man; 6and in those days shall men seek the death, and they shall not find it, and they shall desire to die, and the death shall flee from them."
Revelation,9,7,"And the likenesses of the locusts are like to horses made ready to battle, and upon their heads as crowns like gold, and their faces as faces of men, 8and they had hair as hair of women, and their teeth were as those of lions, 9and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings is as the noise of chariots of many horses running to battle; 10and they have tails like to scorpions, and stings were in their tails; and their authority is to injure men five months; 11and they have over them a king—the messenger of the abyss—a name is to him in Hebrew, Abaddon, and in the Greek he hath a name, Apollyon."
Revelation,9,12,"The first woe did go forth, lo, there come yet two woes after these things. The Sixth Trumpet"
Revelation,9,13,"And the sixth messenger did sound, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the altar of gold that is before God, 14saying to the sixth messenger who had the trumpet, ‘Loose the four messengers who are bound at the great river Euphrates;’ 15and loosed were the four messengers, who have been made ready for the hour, and day, and month, and year, that they may kill the third of men; 16and the number of the forces of the horsemen is two myriads of myriads, and I heard the number of them."
Revelation,9,17,"And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting upon them, having breastplates of fire, and jacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses are as heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceedeth fire, and smoke, and brimstone; 18by these three were the third of men killed, from the fire, and from the smoke, and from the brimstone, that is proceeding out of their mouth, 19for their authorities are in their mouth, and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they do injure; 20and the rest of men, who were not killed in these plagues, neither did reform from the works of their hands, that they may not bow before the demons, and idols, those of gold, and those of silver, and those of brass, and those of stone, and those of wood, that are neither able to see, nor to hear, nor to walk, 21yea they did not reform from their murders, nor from their sorceries, nor from their whoredoms, nor from their thefts."
Revelation,10,1,"And I saw another strong messenger coming down out of the heaven, arrayed with a cloud, and a rainbow upon the head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire, 2and he had in his hand a little scroll opened, and he did place his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the land, 3and he cried with a great voice, as a lion doth roar, and when he cried, speak out did the seven thunders their voices; 4and when the seven thunders spake their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me, ‘Seal the things that the seven thunders spake,’ and, ‘Thou mayest"
Revelation,10,5,"And the messenger whom I saw standing upon the sea, and upon the land, did lift up his hand to the heaven, 6and did swear in Him who doth live to the ages of the ages, who did create the heaven and the things in it, and the land and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it—that time shall not be yet, 7but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger, when he may be about to sound, and the secret of God may be finished, as He did declare to His own servants, to the prophets."
Revelation,10,8,"And the voice that I heard out of the heaven is again speaking with me, and saying, ‘Go, take the little scroll that is open in the hand of the messenger who hath been standing upon the sea, and upon the land:’ 9and I went away unto the messenger, saying to him, ‘Give me the little scroll;’ and he saith to me, ‘Take, and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet—as"
Revelation,10,10,"And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the messenger, and did eat it up, and it was in my mouth as honey—sweet, and when I did eat it—my belly was made bitter; 11and he saith to me, ‘It behoveth thee again to prophesy about peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings—many.’"
Revelation,11,1,"And there was given to me a reed like to a rod, and the messenger stood, saying, ‘Rise, and measure the sanctuary of God, and the altar, and those worshipping in it; 2and the court that is without the sanctuary leave out, and thou mayest not measure it, because it was given to the nations, and the holy city they shall tread down forty-two months; 3and I will give to My two witnesses, and they shall prophesy days, a thousand, two hundred, sixty, arrayed with sackcloth; 4these are the two olive trees, and the two lamp-stands that before the God of the earth do stand; 5and if any one may will to injure them, fire doth proceed out of their mouth, and doth devour their enemies, and if any one may will to"
Revelation,11,6,"These have authority to shut the heaven, that it may not rain rain in the days of their prophecy, and authority they have over the waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the land with every plague, as often as they may will. The Witnesses Killed and Raised 7‘And when they may finish their testimony, the beast that is coming up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them, 8and their dead bodies are upon the broad-place of the great city (that is called spiritually Sodom, and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified,) 9and they shall behold—they of the peoples, and tribes, and tongues, and nations—their dead bodies three days and a half, and their dead bodies they shall not suffer to be put into tombs, 10and those dwelling upon the land shall rejoice over them, and shall make merry, and gifts they shall send to one another, because these—the two prophets—did torment those dwelling upon the land.’"
Revelation,11,11,"And after the three days and a half, a spirit of life from God did enter into them, and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon those beholding them, 12and they heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them, ‘Come up hither;’ and they went up to the heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them; 13and in that hour came a great earthquake, and the tenth of the city did fall, and killed in the earthquake were names of men—seven thousands, and the rest became affrighted, and they gave glory to the God of the heaven."
Revelation,11,14,"The second woe did go forth, lo, the third woe doth come quickly. The Seventh Trumpet"
Revelation,11,15,"And the seventh messenger did sound, and there came great voices in the heaven, saying, ‘The kingdoms of the world did become those of our Lord and of His Christ, and he shall reign to the ages of the ages!’ 16and the twenty and four elders, who before God are sitting upon their thrones, did fall upon their faces, and did bow before God, 17saying, ‘We give thanks to Thee, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art, and who wast, and who art coming, because Thou hast taken Thy great power and didst reign; 18and the nations were angry, and Thine anger did come, and the time of the dead, to be judged, and to give the reward to Thy servants, to the prophets, and to the saints, and to those fearing Thy name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who are destroying the land.’"
Revelation,11,19,"And opened was the sanctuary of God in the heaven, and there was seen the ark of His covenant in His sanctuary, and there did come lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail."
Revelation,12,1,"And a great sign was seen in the heaven, a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars, 2and being with child she doth cry out, travailing and pained to bring forth."
Revelation,12,3,"And there was seen another sign in the heaven, and, lo, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his head seven diadems, 4and his tail doth draw the third of the stars of the heaven, and he did cast them to the earth; and the dragon did stand before the woman who is about to bring forth, that when she may bring forth, her child he may devour; 5and she brought forth a male child, who is about to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, and caught away was her child unto God and His throne, 6and the woman did flee to the wilderness, where she hath a place made ready from God, that there they may nourish her—days a thousand, two hundred, sixty. The War in Heaven"
Revelation,12,7,"And there came war in the heaven; Michael and his messengers did war against the dragon, and the dragon did war, and his messengers, 8and they did not prevail, nor was their place found any more in the heaven; 9and the great dragon was cast forth—the old serpent, who is called ‘Devil,’ and ‘the Adversary,’ who is leading astray the whole world—he was cast forth to the earth, and his messengers"
Revelation,12,10,"And I heard a great voice saying in the heaven, ‘Now did come the salvation, and the power, and the reign, of our God, and the authority of His Christ, because cast down was the accuser of our brethren, who is accusing them before our God day and night; 11and they did overcome him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life—unto death; 12because of this be glad, ye heavens, and those in them who do tabernacle; woe to those inhabiting the land and the sea, because the Devil did go down unto you, having great wrath, having known that he hath little time.’ The Woman Persecuted"
Revelation,12,13,"And when the dragon saw that he was cast forth to the earth, he pursued the woman who did bring forth the male, 14and there were given to the woman two wings of the great eagle, that she may fly to the wilderness, to her place, where she is nourished a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent; 15and the serpent did cast forth after the woman, out of his mouth, water as a river, that he may cause her to be carried away by the river, 16and the land did help the woman, and the land did open its mouth and did swallow up the river, that the dragon did cast forth out of his mouth; 17and the dragon was angry against the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, those keeping the commands of God, and having the testimony of Jesus Christ."
Revelation,13,1,"And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw out of the sea a beast coming up, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon its horns ten diadems, and upon its heads a name of evil speaking, 2and the beast that I saw was like to a leopard, and its feet as of a bear, and its mouth as the mouth"

Revelation,13,5,"And there was given to it a mouth speaking great things, and evil-speakings, and there was given to it authority to make war forty-two months, 6and it did open its mouth for evil-speaking toward God, to speak evil of His name, and of His tabernacle, and of those who in the heaven tabernacle, 7and there was given to it to make war with the saints, and to overcome them, and there was given"
Revelation,13,8,"And bow before it shall all who are dwelling upon the land, whose names have not been written in the scroll of the life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world; 9if any one hath an ear—let him hear: 10if any one a captivity doth gather, into captivity he doth go away; if any one by sword doth kill, it behoveth him by sword to be killed; here is the endurance and the faith of the saints. The Beast from the Earth"
Revelation,13,11,"And I saw another beast coming up out of the land, and it had two horns, like a lamb, and it was speaking as a dragon, 12and all the authority of the first beast doth it do before it, and it maketh the land and those dwelling in it that they shall bow before the first beast, whose deadly stroke was healed, 13and it doth great signs, that fire also it may make to come down from the heaven to the earth before men, 14and it leadeth astray those dwelling on the land, because of the signs that were given it to do before the beast, saying to those dwelling upon the land to make an image to the beast that hath the stroke of the sword and did live, 15and there was given to it to give a spirit to the image of the beast, that also the image of the beast may speak, and that it may cause as many as shall not bow before the image of the beast, that they may be killed. The Mark of the Beast"
Revelation,13,16,"And it maketh all, the small, and the great, and the rich, and the poor, and the freemen, and the servants, that it may give to them a mark upon their right hand or upon their foreheads, 17and that no one may be able to buy, or to sell, except he who is having the mark, or the name of the beast, or the"
Revelation,13,18,"Here is the wisdom! He who is having the understanding, let him count the number of the beast, for the number of a man it is, and its number is six hundred and sixty six."
Revelation,14,1,"And I saw, and lo, a Lamb having stood upon the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousands, having the name of his Father written upon their foreheads; 2and I heard a voice out of the heaven, as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of great thunder, and a voice I heard of harpers harping with their harps, 3and they sing, as it were, a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders, and no one was able to learn the song except the hundred forty-four thousands, who have been bought from the earth; 4these are they who with women were not defiled, for they are virgin; these are they who are following the Lamb whithersoever he may go; these were bought from among men—a first-fruit to God and to the Lamb— 5and in their mouth there was not found guile, for unblemished are they before the throne of God. The Three Angels and Babylon’s Fall"
Revelation,14,6,"And I saw another messenger flying in mid-heaven, having good news age-during to proclaim to those dwelling upon the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people, 7saying in a great voice, ‘Fear ye God, and give to Him glory, because come did the hour of His judgment, and bow ye before Him who did make the heaven, and the land, and sea, and fountains of waters.’"
Revelation,14,8,"And another messenger did follow, saying, ‘Fall, fall, did Babylon, the great city, because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom she hath given to all nations to drink.’"
Revelation,14,9,"And a third messenger did follow them, saying in a great voice, ‘If any one the beast doth bow before, and his image, and doth receive a mark upon his forehead, or upon his hand, 10he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, that hath been mingled unmixed in the cup of His anger, and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy messengers, and before the Lamb, 11and the smoke of their torment doth go up to ages of ages; and they have no rest day and night, who are bowing"

Revelation,14,13,"And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me, ‘Write: Happy are the dead who in the Lord are dying from this time!’ ‘Yes, (saith the Spirit,) That they may rest from their labours—and their works do follow them!’ The Harvest of the Earth"
Revelation,14,14,"And I saw, and lo, a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sitting like to a son of man, having upon his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle; 15and another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary crying in a great voice to him who is sitting upon the cloud, ‘Send forth thy sickle and reap, because come to thee hath the hour of reaping, because ripe hath been the harvest of the earth;’ 16and he who is sitting upon the cloud did put forth his sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped."
Revelation,14,17,"And another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary that is in the heaven, having—he also— a sharp sickle, 18and another messenger did come forth out from the altar, having authority over the fire, and he called with a great cry to him having the sharp sickle, saying, ‘Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, because come to perfection have her grapes;’ 19and the messenger did put forth his sickle to the earth, and did gather the vine of the earth, and did cast it to the great wine-press of the wrath of God; 20and trodden was the wine-press outside of the city, and blood did come forth out of the wine-press—unto the bridles of the horses, a thousand, six hundred furlongs."
Revelation,15,1,"And I saw another sign in the heaven, great and wonderful, seven messengers having the seven last plagues, because in these was completed the wrath of God, 2and I saw as a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who do gain the victory over the beast, and his image, and his mark, and the number of his name, standing by the sea of the glass, having harps of God, 3and they sing the song of Moses, servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, ‘Great and wonderful are Thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty, righteous and true are Thy ways, O King of saints, 4who may not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? because Thou alone art kind, because all the nations shall come and bow before Thee, because Thy righteous acts were manifested.’ Preparation for Judgment"
Revelation,15,5,"And after these things I saw, and lo, opened was the sanctuary of the tabernacle of the testimony in the heaven; 6and come forth did the seven messengers having the seven plagues, out of the sanctuary, clothed in linen, pure and shining, and girded round the breasts with golden girdles: 7and one of the four living creatures did give to the seven messengers seven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, who is living to the ages of the ages; 8and filled was the sanctuary with smoke from the glory of God, and from His power, and no one was able to enter into the sanctuary till the seven plagues of the seven messengers may be finished."
Revelation,16,1,"And I heard a great voice out of the sanctuary saying to the seven messengers, ‘Go away, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God to the earth;’ 2and the first did go away, and did pour out his vial upon the land, and there came a sore—bad and grievous—to men, those having the mark of the beast, and those bowing to his image."
Revelation,16,3,"And the second messenger did pour out his vial to the sea, and there came blood as of one dead, and every living soul died in the sea."
Revelation,16,4,"And the third messenger did pour out his vial to the rivers, and to the fountains of the waters, and there came blood, 5and I heard the messenger of the waters, saying, ‘righteous, O Lord, art Thou, who art, and who wast, and who shalt be, because these things Thou didst judge, 6because blood of saints and prophets they did pour out, and blood to them Thou didst give to drink, for they are worthy;’ 7and I heard another out of the altar, saying, ‘Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Thy judgments.’"
Revelation,16,8,"And the fourth messenger did pour out his vial upon the sun, and there was given to him to scorch men with fire, 9and men were scorched with great heat, and they did speak evil of the name of God, who hath authority over these plagues, and they did not reform—to give to Him glory."
Revelation,16,10,"And the fifth messenger did pour out his vial upon the throne of the beast, and his kingdom did become darkened, and they were gnawing their tongues from the pain, 11and they did speak evil of the God of the heaven, from their pains, and from their sores, and they did not reform from their works."
Revelation,16,12,"And the sixth messenger did pour out his vial upon the great river, the Euphrates, and dried up was its water, that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun may be made ready; 13and I saw come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs— 14for they are spirits of demons, doing signs—which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to bring them together to the battle of that great day of God the Almighty;— 15lo, I do come as a thief; happy is he who is watching, and keeping his garments, that he may not walk naked, and they may see his unseemliness,’— 16and they did bring them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon. The Seventh Bowl of Wrath"
Revelation,16,17,"And the seventh messenger did pour out his vial to the air, and there came forth a great voice from the sanctuary of the heaven, from the throne, saying, ‘It hath come!’ 18and there came voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and a great earthquake came, such as came not since men came upon the"
Revelation,16,19,"And it came—the great city—into three parts, and the cities of the nations did fall, and Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the wrath of His anger, 20and every island did flee away, and mountains were not found, 21and great hail (as of talent weight) doth come down out of the heaven upon men, and men did speak evil of God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague is very great."
Revelation,17,1,"And there came one of the seven messengers, who were having the seven vials, and he spake with me, saying to me, ‘Come, I will shew to thee the judgment of the great whore, who is sitting upon the many waters, 2with whom the kings of the earth did commit whoredom; and made drunk from the wine of her whoredom were those inhabiting the earth;’ 3and he carried me away to a wilderness in the Spirit, and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of evil-speaking, having seven heads and ten horns, 4and the woman was arrayed with purple and scarlet-colour, and gilded with gold, and precious stone, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and uncleanness of her whoredom, 5and upon her forehead was a name written: ‘Secret, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Whores, and the Abominations of the earth.’ The Mystery Explained"
Revelation,17,6,"And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the saints, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus, and I did wonder—having seen her—with great wonder; 7and the messenger said to me, ‘Wherefore didst thou wonder? I—I will tell thee the secret of the woman and of the beast that is carrying her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns. 8‘The beast that thou didst see: it was, and it is not; and it is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go away to destruction, and wonder shall those dwelling upon the earth, whose names have not been written upon the scroll of the life from the foundation of the world, beholding the beast that was,"
Revelation,17,9,"Here is the mind that is having wisdom; the seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman doth sit, 10and there are seven kings, the five did fall, and the one is, the other did not yet come, and when he may come, it behoveth him to remain a little time; 11and the beast that was, and is not, he also is eighth, and out of the seven he is, and to destruction he doth go away. 12‘And the ten horns that thou sawest, are ten kings, who a kingdom did not yet receive, but authority as kings the same hour do receive with the beast, 13these have one mind, and their own power and authority to the beast they shall give over; The Victory of the Lamb 14these with the Lamb shall make war, and the Lamb shall overcome them, because Lord of lords he is, and King of kings, and those with him are called, and choice, and stedfast.’"
Revelation,17,15,"And he saith to me, ‘The waters that thou didst see, where the whore doth sit, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues;’ 16and the ten horns that thou didst see upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her in fire, 17for God did give into their hearts to do its mind, and to make one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast till the sayings of God may be complete, 18and the woman that thou didst see is the great city that is having reign over the kings of the land.’"
Revelation,18,1,"And after these things I saw another messenger coming down out of the heaven, having great authority, and the earth was lightened from his glory, 2and he did cry in might—a great voice, saying, ‘Fall, fall did Babylon the great, and she became a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird, 3because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom have all the nations drunk, and the kings of the earth with her did commit whoredom, and merchants of the earth from the power of her revel were made rich."
Revelation,18,4,"And I heard another voice out of the heaven, saying, ‘Come forth out of her, My people, that ye may not partake with her sins, and that ye may not receive of her plagues, 5because her sins did follow—"
Revelation,18,6,"Render to her as also she did render to you, and double to her doubles according to her works; in the cup that she did mingle mingle to her double. 7‘As much as she did glorify herself and did revel, so much torment and sorrow give to her, because in her heart she saith, I sit a queen, and a widow I am not, and sorrow I shall not see; 8because of this, in one day, shall come her plagues, death, and sorrow, and famine; and in fire she shall be utterly burned, because strong is the Lord God who is judging her; Lament over Babylon 9and weep over her, and smite themselves for her, shall the kings of the earth, who with her did commit whoredom and did revel, when they may see the smoke of her burning, 10from afar having stood because of the fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city! Babylon, the strong city! because in one hour did come thy judgment. 11‘And the merchants of the earth shall weep and sorrow over her, because their lading no one doth buy any more; 12lading of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most precious wood, and brass, and iron, and marble, 13and cinnamon, and odours, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots, and of bodies and souls of men. 14‘And the fruits of the desire of thy soul did go away from thee, and all things—the dainty and the bright—did go away from thee, and no more at all mayest thou find them."
Revelation,18,15,"The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, far off shall stand because of the fear of her torment, weeping, and sorrowing, 16and saying, Woe, woe, the great city, that was arrayed with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and gilded in gold, and precious stone, and pearls—because in one hour so much riches were made waste! 17‘And every shipmaster, and all the company upon the ships, and sailors, and as many as work the sea, far off stood, 18and were crying, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like to the great city? 19and they did cast dust upon their heads, and were crying out, weeping and sorrowing, saying, Woe, woe, the great city! in which were made rich all having ships in the sea, out of her costliness—for in one hour was she made waste. 20‘Be glad over her, O heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets, because God did judge your judgment of her!’ The Doom of Babylon"
Revelation,18,21,"And one strong messenger did take up a stone as a great millstone, and did cast it to the sea, saying, ‘Thus with violence shall Babylon be cast, the great city, and may not be found any more at all; 22and voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, may not be heard at all in thee any more; and any artisan of any art may not be found at all in thee any more; and noise of a millstone may not be heard at all in thee any more; 23and light of a lamp may not shine at all in thee any more; and voice of bridegroom and of bride may not be heard at all in thee any more; because thy merchants were the great ones of the earth, because in thy sorcery were all the nations led astray, 24and in her blood of prophets and of saints was found, and of all those who have been slain on the earth.’"
Revelation,19,1,"And after these things I heard a great voice of a great multitude in the heaven, saying, ‘Alleluia! the salvation, and the glory, and the honour, and the power, is to the Lord our God; 2because true and righteous are His judgments, because He did judge the great whore who did corrupt the earth in her whoredom, and He did avenge the blood of His servants at her hand;’ 3and a second time they said,"
Revelation,19,4,"And fall down did the elders—the twenty and four—and the four living creatures, and they did bow before God who is sitting upon the"
Revelation,19,5,"And a voice out of the throne did come forth, saying, ‘Praise our God, all ye His servants, and those fearing Him, both the small and the great;’ The Marriage of the Lamb 6and I heard as the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, ‘Alleluia! because reign did the Lord God—the Almighty! 7may we rejoice and exult, and give the glory to Him, because come did the marriage of the Lamb, and his wife did make herself ready; 8and there was given to her that she may be arrayed with fine linen, pure and shining, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.’"
Revelation,19,9,"And he saith to me, ‘Write: Happy are they who to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb have been called;’ and he saith to me, ‘These are the true words of God;’ 10and I fell before his feet, to bow before him, and he saith to me, ‘See—not! fellow servant of thee am I, and of thy brethren, those having the testimony of Jesus; bow before God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy.’ The Rider on the White Horse"
Revelation,19,11,"And I saw the heaven having been opened, and lo, a white horse, and he who is sitting upon it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness doth he judge and war, 12and his eyes are as a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems—having a name written that no one hath known, except himself, 13and he is arrayed with a garment covered with blood, and his name is called, The Word of"
Revelation,19,14,"And the armies in the heaven were following him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen— white and pure; 15and out of his mouth doth proceed a sharp sword, that with it he may smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and he doth tread the press of the wine of the wrath and the anger of God the Almighty, 16and he hath upon the garment and upon his thigh the name written, ‘King of kings, and Lord of lords.’ Defeat of the Beast and False Prophet"
Revelation,19,17,"And I saw one messenger standing in the sun, and he cried, a great voice, saying to all the birds that are flying in mid-heaven, ‘Come and be gathered together to the supper of the great God, 18that ye may eat flesh of kings, and flesh of chiefs of thousands, and flesh of strong men, and flesh of horses, and of those sitting on them, and the flesh of all—freemen and servants—both small and great.’"
Revelation,19,19,"And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, having been gathered together to make war with him who is sitting upon the horse, and with his army; 20and the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who did the signs before him, in which he led astray those who did receive the mark of the beast, and those who did bow before his image; living they were cast—the two—to the lake of the fire, that is burning with brimstone; 21and the rest were killed with the sword of him who is sitting on the horse, which sword is proceeding out of his mouth, and all the birds were filled out of their flesh."
Revelation,20,1,"And I saw a messenger coming down out of the heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain over his hand, 2and he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, who is Devil and Adversary, and did bind him a thousand years, 3and he cast him to the abyss, and did shut him up, and put a seal upon him, that he may not lead astray the nations any more, till the thousand years may be finished; and after these it behoveth him to be loosed a little time."
Revelation,20,4,"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them, and the souls of those who have been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus, and because of the word of God, and who did not bow before the beast, nor his image, and did not receive the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand, and they did live and reign with Christ the thousand years; 5and the rest of the"
Revelation,20,6,"Happy and holy is he who is having part in the first rising again; over these the second death hath not authority, but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. Satan Cast into the Lake of Fire"
Revelation,20,7,"And when the thousand years may be finished, the Adversary shall be loosed out of his prison, 8and he shall go forth to lead the nations astray, that are in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog— to gather them together to war, of whom the number is as the sand of the sea; 9and they did go up over the breadth of the land, and did surround the camp of the saints, and the beloved city, and there came down fire from God out of the heaven, and devoured them; 10and the Devil, who is leading them astray, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are the beast and the false prophet, and they shall be tormented day and night—to the ages of the ages. Judgment before the Great White Throne"
Revelation,20,11,"And I saw a great white throne, and Him who is sitting upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven did flee away, and place was not found for them; 12and I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and scrolls were opened, and another scroll was opened, which is that of the life, and the dead were judged out of the things written in the scrolls—according to their works; 13and the sea did give up those dead in it, and the death and the hades did give up the dead in them, and they were judged, each one according to their works; 14and the death and the hades were cast to the lake of the fire—this is the second death; 15and if any one was not found written in the scroll of the life, he was cast to the lake of the fire."
Revelation,21,1,"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth did pass away, and the sea is not any more; 2and I, John, saw the holy city—new Jerusalem—coming down from God out of the heaven, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband; 3and I heard a great voice out of the heaven, saying, ‘Lo, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them—their God, 4and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, and the death shall not be any more, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor shall there be any more pain, because the first things did go away.’"
Revelation,21,5,"And He who is sitting upon the throne said, ‘Lo, new I make all things; and He saith to me, ‘Write, because these words are true and stedfast;’ 6and He said to me, ‘It hath been done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End; I, to him who is thirsting, will give of the fountain of the water of the life freely; 7he who is overcoming shall inherit all things, and I will be to him—a God, and he shall be to me—the son, 8and to fearful, and unstedfast, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the liars, their part is in the lake that is burning with fire and brimstone, which is a second death.’ The New Jerusalem"
Revelation,21,9,"And there came unto me one of the seven messengers, who have the seven vials that are full of the seven last plagues, and he spake with me, saying, ‘Come, I will shew thee the bride of the Lamb—the wife,’ 10and he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and did shew to me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, 11having the glory of God, and her light is like a stone most precious, as a jasper stone clear as crystal, 12having also a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve messengers, and names written thereon, which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel, 13at the east three gates, at the north three gates, at the south three gates, at the west three gates; 14and the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
Revelation,21,15,"And he who is speaking with me had a golden reed, that he may measure the city, and its gates, and its wall; 16and the city lieth square, and the length of it is as great as the breadth; and he did measure the city with the reed—furlongs twelve thousand; the length, and the breadth, and the height, of it are equal; 17and he measured its wall, an hundred forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of the messenger; 18and the building of its wall was jasper, and the city is pure gold—like to pure glass; 19and the foundations of the wall of the city with every precious stone have been adorned; the first foundation jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 20the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth,"
Revelation,21,21,"And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, each several one of the gates was of one pearl; and the broad-place of the city is pure gold—as transparent glass."
Revelation,21,22,"And a sanctuary I did not see in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, is its sanctuary, and the Lamb, 23and the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they may shine in it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp of it is the Lamb; 24and the nations of the saved in its light shall walk, and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it, 25and its gates shall not at all be shut by day, for night shall not be there; 26and they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it; 27and there may not at all enter into it any thing defiling and doing abomination, and a lie, but—those written in the scroll of the life of the Lamb."
Revelation,22,1,"And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb: 2in the midst of its broad place, and of the river on this side and on that, is a tree of life, yielding twelve fruits, in each several month rendering its fruits, and the leaves of the tree are for the service of the nations; 3and any curse there shall not be any more, and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him, 4and they shall see His face, and His name is upon their foreheads, 5and night shall not be there, and they have no need of a lamp and light of a sun, because the Lord God doth give them light, and they shall reign—to the ages of the ages. Jesus Is Coming"
Revelation,22,6,"And he said to me, ‘These words are stedfast and true, and the Lord God of the holy prophets did send His messenger to shew to His servants the things that it behoveth to come quickly:"
Revelation,22,7,"Lo, I come quickly; happy is he who is keeping the words of the prophecy of this scroll.’"
Revelation,22,8,"And I, John, am he who is seeing these things and hearing, and when I heard and beheld, I fell down to bow before the feet of the messenger who is shewing me these things; 9and he saith to me, ‘See— not; for fellow-servant of thee am I, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of those keeping the words of this scroll; before God bow.’"
Revelation,22,10,"And he saith to me, ‘Thou mayest not seal the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is nigh; 11he who is unrighteous—let him be unrighteous still, and he who is filthy—let him be filthy still, and he who is righteous—let him be declared righteous still, and he who is sanctified—let him be sanctified still:"
Revelation,22,12,"And lo, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to render to each as his work shall be;"
Revelation,22,13,"I am the Alpha and the Omega—the Beginning and End—the First and the Last. 14‘Happy are those doing His commands that the authority shall be theirs unto the tree of the life, and by the gates they may enter into the city; 15and without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the whoremongers, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one who is loving and is doing a lie. 16‘I, Jesus did send my messenger to testify to you these things concerning the assemblies; I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright and morning star!"
Revelation,22,17,"And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and he who is hearing—let him say, Come; and he who is thirsting—let him come; and he who is willing—let him take the water of life freely. Nothing May Be Added or Removed 18‘For I testify to every one hearing the words of the prophecy of this scroll, if any one may add unto these, God shall add to him the plagues that have been written in this scroll, 19and if any one may take away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the scroll of the life, and out of the holy city, and the things that have been written in this scroll;’ 20he saith—who is testifying these things—‘Yes, I come quickly!’ Amen! Yes, be coming, Lord Jesus!"
Revelation,22,21,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you all. Amen.
